this is James R@@ isen .
she might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone listening to Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he showed the N@@ SA illegal from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should be left a lasting impression .
in it , he describes a cat@@ astro@@ phic US secret operation , in which the CIA over@@ took literally designs for an atomic bomb .
if this sounds crazy , you read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter does not like at all ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government was determined against iron and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the patterns of government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and ob@@ sc@@ oring journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media cannot get these information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they are reason@@ ably priced .
so when the government approached R@@ isen , he did something that many brave repor@@ ter did before him : he refused and said he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen has lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , though for many years it had been vital for their case , the claims of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide fewer .
instead of failure and dism@@ iss@@ ants to make statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , got his ph@@ oning , secret ,
as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and ban@@ ch@@ information , its credit information , and even travel tips with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and tear .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments over him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government grew too much from its work as being secret .
since 11 September , almost every article on national security was the result of that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower went into one journalist .
so we place the corporate work on the game , which should be protected by the first const@@ itu@@ ary , because the government has more possibilities to spy out all .
but equally as technology of the government allows to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ lic@@ ans , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
in fact , they can hold that from the moment they are in contact , instead of resting , in the witness .
today there is communication software which hasn &apos;t existed when R@@ isen has written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is a Secure@@ Drop , an open source shift system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed from the internet world , developed by us , and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload files or send information so as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the respective news agency .
so the government cannot proc@@ ure more information , and many of the information it would request it would not be available from the out@@ set .
Secure@@ Drop is however only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world develop new spy technologies that all end@@ angers us all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of abuse during the supply of soldiers hum@@ d knows and reported by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm for contam@@ inated water from Flin@@ t . or a wall street in@@ sider that war@@ ns us in front of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our const@@ itu@@ tions .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; was released , &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#93; &#91; which means that the rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sum of money &#93; have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness around a statement . &#93; This week we were asked of news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents published in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ el Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a glimp@@ se into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as mos@@ sy Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are also reports that one ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead to a narrow friend of children days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who are nervous on the next release , and wait for the next release documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that tackle us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ases and not all have to pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few minutes to hide their assets and to ve@@ g -- something we have been discuss@@ ing and un@@ veil for ten years .
I think many people will conf@@ use this entire world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it is like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ g Cap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company what it nearly impossible to understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I find it interesting that in the USA there are fewer reports on this matter .
probably because there have been no famous Americans that occurred in these re@@ vel@@ ations , such sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that are under control in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands , or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see lots more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US States less information needs to give less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this type of incen@@ tive in the USA has allowed some school districts to leave school children .
it is allowed to zoom in , particularly vulner@@ able tra@@ ilers .
it is this kind of behavior that all affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to figure out how all of this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
thus , we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 woo@@ dy companies in Manhattan .
our agent gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring some money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was all pre@@ judi@@ ce . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over money to anybody . but this is the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who made suggestions in our conc@@ e@@ aled investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single leading politicians , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty , and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we must change rules of rules .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
this may sound much more energetic , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing would ever have changed ; as if it always will ever be the weal@@ thy and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I am quite happy that some have started changing .
over the past few years we have seen ahead to more transparency , aff@@ ecting the owners of companies .
the topic took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then the EU has captured central regist@@ ers at the national level , who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls it .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary procedures , but this does not imp@@ ly the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama re@@ vel@@ ations , this huge glimp@@ se into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people that are fur@@ ious when they see how others can hide their real identity behind head@@ lamps .
we need managers in the economy that rise up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians , who know the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of in@@ transparent .
together we can finally stop this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the boot of a red Maz@@ da race .
one day after I finished my design study , I completed a farm .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da did not sit and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in town and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he tells me how he wanted to change the world .
it was getting late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake it asking : &quot; where do you sleep for tonight ? &quot;
he got the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what can I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know it ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot space !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Do you like ? &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I fro@@ ze on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what happened to me there ?
a wild bo@@ ar sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I climbed up out of the bed , to toe on toe and my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he purchased from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in a stranger was , were friends who just waited for it ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let us make a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate draws and the rent is lifted .
I learned that at the time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can be able to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and partner Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could do something about it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and started as &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at our top floor for 20 dollars on a wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ ettes tast@@ ed completely different , because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door went into the castle , Brian and I went on .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to post a site , on which people have public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms and the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the miss@@ ile would ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in consol@@ ation would invest in a shop that permits strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned all that strangers are dangerous .
when one has a problem , one tells about things that you can make . we could be designed .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it &apos;s the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who never met before .
can design work such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with the design ?
I want to give you a sample , what degree we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . you will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now , I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
type your locked mobile phone your left seat .
this quiet approach of panic that you feel right now -- -- is exactly what will feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel about holding the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Go@@ res phone now ?
could you please call on Twitter that he is responsible for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phone now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbour could only have imag@@ ined with his name ; if he had told what he comes from , how his dog or his children be called ?
imagine you &apos;d have 150 pre@@ judi@@ ces that all say : &quot; he can really hold out mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you &apos;d have to leave your phone ?
for a well @-@ thought feedback system makes trust decisive .
in the beginning , we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative complaint .
in the end , we decided to wait until both the host and guest were handed over , before we asked them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford which is how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are related to age and residence .
a little surprising we trust in people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting if one adds to the call of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ ries .
if you have less than three orders , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
good reputation set out simil@@ ar@@ ities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much one is reason@@ ably priced .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you &apos;re talking about too little like Hi ! , you don &apos;t get an answer .
as for example , too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of open@@ ness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le art@@ works in your apartment ! I &apos;m working with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I furn@@ ish it with design to produce this degree of open@@ ness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to deposit these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people will take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
firstly , unbelie@@ v@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that was not covered before .
for us the business has just been very good .
of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have celebrated parties celebrated or have spoiled flats .
our host have guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust became broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts even if I think only about it .
the dis@@ appointment , which you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves .
luck@@ ily , there was only a fra@@ ction of the 123 million overnight stays .
for people trust in a row .
when trust works , Wonder@@ ful may arise .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers to tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra is real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives , even though they do not know at all .
you drive in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they get books .
you can stay one even longer without charging additional extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not everybody is running .
but these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
for the first time I stum@@ bled across this concept , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions work together ?
it is about an economical trade .
but now it &apos;s just a &quot; rental industry &quot; to call , the thing is not just being justified .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself open , and this changes everything .
today , if you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if one had to wait for every place that would be visited a group there would be a thorough reconstruction , and show you one out with a K@@ nei@@ pent@@ our district , from which you have never heard about it ;
or if you could cook a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays flats are designed according to privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would have thought of a shared share ?
I imagine cities which enable us to find society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and sc@@ ot@@ ation .
this project started in South Korea &apos;s capital of Seoul . lots of parking which belonged to the government ,
were now available to residents . students who were searching for an stay ,
were sent to people whose children were moved . there were incub@@ ators programs included ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger or self @-@ host .
so the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught us .
we invented the wheel not new .
hospitality was there even before .
there were already similar web sites to us .
so why has just our works ?
apart from happiness and tim@@ ing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep root pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find this ast@@ o@@ unding ,
just overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da rides me .
we know , of course , that design can not solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ wash bra@@ in@@ wash , a terror@@ ist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people , which look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for anyone who has never met a Muslim : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee designer -- dou@@ bl@@ es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ch@@ ide @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sing , for baby , I was not born like that .
I have chosen to do this .
when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , like some of my friends but as Muslims . I decided to wear Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why are you op@@ pressed yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was , then it was a femin@@ ist independence day for me , and compared to the print I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have been strug@@ gling with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought that was question@@ ing , doub@@ ting and believed .
my relationship to God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender that deep@@ en with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm is sometimes makes me cry .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever felt the feeling you perceive , you fully under@@ stands , and yet somehow loves ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and started to like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked to the screen and looked at the word &quot; Breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jum@@ ped from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into anger .
why should one do such a thing ?
I switched to the television channel and heard them ... &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ...
Oh , my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the n@@ u turned me the deeds of one citizen into a susp@@ ect .
that same day we had to go through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember what I drove -- as we were silent -- so deeply I went in my seat , and I feared the first time I was being recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the National islam@@ ic organisations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; If be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed all week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
and again the war@@ nings said : &quot; don &apos;t go to this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw my extensive coverage .
the feelings were under@@ stand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who kept for Muslims to break and beat them .
there were really sur@@ f@@ ences on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt right .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have master@@ ed the rage of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love issues .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays , we can actually tell people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go on it ? &quot;
some people want Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they talk of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we v@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor remains only under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , aesthetic and Olymp@@ ion@@ ics .
will the closure of Czech in America make it safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
regular visiting a mosque makes people to consider other faith toler@@ ant , and show more citizenship .
as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not radical in mos@@ ques .
you will be radic@@ alizing in your cellar or bed in front of a computer .
the radic@@ alization process has been noted that it begins online . as a first , the person from her church is cut off , even from her family to say that the extre@@ mist@@ y of terror@@ ists say that the facts are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ n@@ ate their behavior and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or fallen from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS uses their brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as the Muslim , as a mother , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imagination , when one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clari@@ fier with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you throw a look at them , they do not suffer what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into Scripture .
a outstanding im@@ am told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she imag@@ ined she could join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him whether she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world would only bring her in trouble .
inspired by nothing but gave sense to their anger , she was a main goal for instrumental virtu@@ alization by extrem@@ ists giving up a solution .
this Im@@ am restored the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ use her anger , he showed a construc@@ tive way of a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and my family concerns .
but how does normal Americans look like ?
how does it affects everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption be consumed by fear every day based on our democracy ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show if we fear we happen at least three things .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian governmental system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
one study shows : if one has reported Test@@ ed news , in which negative was reported about Muslims , they agree to military attacks on Muslims in Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only a joke problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims , between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never happened in connection with terror@@ ists .
it happened in the beginning of the war against Iraq and during two seasons .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for manip@@ ulating the public to raise the foundation of a free society , r@@ ational and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we perhaps feel it the first , but the toxic air of fear hin@@ es us all .
in the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was talented , talented and promising at the dental fac@@ ulty ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did my bridge have become such a sav@@ vy young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon . he did in her apartment as when he posted comments against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he fired eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the Mos@@ que or were we safely at home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
we examined silence with our son in the children &apos;s seat , high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and drew up my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , kept myself .
the hall was completely filled .
then Im@@ am had an announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests , as the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , credit@@ ors and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to assist .
in that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they had courage and compassion towards panic and pre@@ judi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join them that mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say you think that you are holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a monument with drau@@ ght , in a clas@@ sy thought factory , i.e. an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive you . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem to appear as a rule , usually the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers is about to become a billions of billions of dollars .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air par@@ cels are invaded into our social awareness , autonomous fleet of air machines in the F@@ RAC Centre was built live in France on a six @-@ metre high tower . some years ago , they started flying with rop@@ es .
by connecting to these air@@ ways , air@@ instruments achieve high speed and acceleration in the same space .
they can build independently of in@@ accessible structures .
they have learned to carry bur@@ dens that deal with turbul@@ ence and to react in general on natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonomous flight .
thus a system autonomous works , it has to know collective sh@@ ei@@ d where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what machine should do .
external commands are provided on the highest level . e.g. , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other Star@@ r@@ whis@@ ers it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
unlike most starting blocks , it can float , and has great benefits for launch and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind ar@@ ches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal location can be recovered and performance by practic@@ ing can be improved .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract ideas that advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts , which accum@@ ulate in order to harm you .
for decades , trained pilots couldn &apos;t fly far controlled air@@ ways that had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
long ago , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ el@@ an , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ ulated flying machine . it was invented in short time .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no g@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ ding , no further inst@@ inc@@ ts or control surfaces , just one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside the inner life a lot so that it can fly stable and can move in space everywhere .
but it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear window . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability that it is correct if all look at me is slight , so I &apos;ll show you a video which was filmed last night .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ an is an exercise in gen@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this excess ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why it is equivalent to its orientation .
he receives the extraordinary skill ,
to move in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even like it rot@@ ates .
it is quite complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers .
quite can be offered in models , the rest is learned directly at flying .
let us see it .
if flying machines should be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin prop@@ ellers .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong , the engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly further , if limited .
we will demonstrate this now by making half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took Commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ ra -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with local technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room she is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations motiv@@ ate to re@@ think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us lies the reward in development and production act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economical potential is the t@@ ittle on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant galaxy were getting faster , they turned the mass of three planes in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
this very short moment , they turned bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not put them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was handed over into the space @-@ time structure and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events temporarily .
1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has spar@@ ed a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , people and -- God is standing at -- even the Internet .
some 25 years ago a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector by the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech to create a giant laser detector that are caused by col@@ li@@ ating black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognised them as a crazy com@@ ies , so that U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Ob@@ servatory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition rate .
thus it is called the Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o started clearing some smaller , stub@@ born problems for a last attempt .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the det@@ ectors of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes caused through the Earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the leave of my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investig@@ ating Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their ob@@ servatory such as Lig@@ o meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ us@@ ory within the structure of space and time .
by passing the shaft , the space and its overall content will be stretched in a direction and put into the other .
to illustr@@ ate , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses lead to the theory of rel@@ ativity often a really al@@ ber@@ nal dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , expand and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each one of us stretched out the waves and ended up . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . then said the Lig@@ o employees for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be precisely measured on less than a thousand radius of a nuclear power radius . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vitation
drive Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties of building such det@@ ectors are tremendous .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are fin@@ nish and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is to be more an ear as an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone .
this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by keeping the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds it is different .
audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much :
about the face of your child approximately .
instead we listen according to specific properties such as pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ mer Bob &quot; .
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make easy images of objects in space with them .
but by keeping changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audible range .
if we convert wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the All literally .
now the gravity is listening to about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , what my colleague Scott tells a very long time .
S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , easily : w@@ up@@ p !
turn out the two bodies very quickly , one hears the same cur@@ ls with an additional ton@@ ing change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a type of motion sensor , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o following : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; No one know what he must hear is known as sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with 30 times per solar mass , which about as fast as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : we think about what it means .
two black holes , the di@@ ch@@ eted body in All , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ve about one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine that forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein consists the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe , as never before was possible .
on this way , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or generally -- not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about things .
the exciting physical processes happen in the heart , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see through , because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is covered by his own lumin@@ aires .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back up to the beginning .
and most import@@ antly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see , and of whom we have never seen . things we just discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found the first attempt to get things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak of the bone kno@@ ck for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us to have a completely different viewing angle on events in space , on the creation of the stars and ultimately , as we emerged from this may@@ hem .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories - a completely new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and in All .
for what could be better than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
for one year I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; I feared that I feared me .
no matter if it was nervous that brought me into un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I have to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted me to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , I feared that , my fear removed .
my fear , to keep spe@@ e@@ ches , my social anxiety - pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain thing that changed my life , definitely un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly . it started with a question of my infants .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the Klein@@ ste , is calling for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all . &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; swe@@ eth@@ me , I need milk for my whis@@ per . &quot;
she once asked me whether I could play with her when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family . from there I bo@@ ther@@ ed to play with them once you go to it . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am trying very much .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently , I was completely understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; sw@@ ages to play with my children to save my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a author . I think things out and feel free to life .
dream job .
no , not .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I press television .
I &apos;m doing television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for applying 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode of four days four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which simultaneously in production are four times four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows run on Thursday evening .
in the whole world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I created themselves , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sc@@ ure . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who else is doing ?
no one , I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I do not want to im@@ press you with it .
I tell you , because I know what you think is the word &quot; author . &quot;
I tell you all of them that work so hard for you to take a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , so you understand that I &apos;m not just ro@@ aring around the computer , and it is correct if I say : I don &apos;t understand that I don &apos;t miss a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , everything that is reality , all blood , all sweat - no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I was en@@ gros@@ sed in my work , there is no different feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is when I set up troops , as a painting I found on a canvas .
as if you carry a high sound , cover a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all of that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , so@@ unding and maternal , cru@@ el@@ ly and r@@ ational . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the work is well underway .
a sum@@ s begin in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on it .
many people participate if I tell them the sum@@ s that I persu@@ ade it to give me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with the television production , when I began to work and work , build and work , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the amount is more than writing .
the sum@@ s are action and activity . sum@@ s are a drug .
the sum@@ s are music . the sum@@ s are light and air .
the sum@@ s are God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot look different than in size .
the feeling that cannot be different compared to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called gen@@ ius .
maybe it is ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want it to question .
to make it clear : the more successful I get , the more episodes , the more points , the more things at the same time , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more it I write history .
the more I work to be successful , the more I need to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the h@@ um , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this amount . I love the amount .
I need the amount of sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , over@@ run .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth , that their m@@ ama is a single employer .
Har@@ per told people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write to my nie@@ ce . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ ts , I want to go to Sh@@ onda on land . &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine stopped .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , not deleg@@ ates , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an advance show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just didn &apos;t have fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s were me .
so , what if you do , what to do , the work you love suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know some might think : &quot; gras@@ shop@@ per you , stupid Author Titan . &quot;
but you do , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , one loves you to be a ban@@ ker , a ban@@ ker , a girl , if you know the sum@@ s , and know how to stop the sum@@ s , when the sum@@ s stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart ceas@@ es , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states &apos; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asked me a question .
I &apos;m on the way out , getting late , and she says : &quot; m@@ um , you like playing ? &quot;
and I want to say no more than to know me two things :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and secon@@ dly , they were not called &quot; Evalu@@ ator . &quot;
they call no more &quot; lau@@ rels . &quot;
when did it happen ?
I pas@@ se it , if I feel Titan and my sum@@ s , and here all changes my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and her sisters stum@@ ble , we laugh a lot and I &apos;m reading very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are st@@ icky fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ isses , delicate voices , watch@@ words and the song in which it goes slo@@ gan@@ s , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Eis@@ queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity is everywhere .
the air in that place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me loos@@ ens .
a mental door goes on and a burst of energy is coming .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s are slowly coming back .
no full noise , hardly there , it is quiet , barely audible , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
now , now , I feel as I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we &apos;ve forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself from broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot about what the real sum@@ s are .
the amount is not power and it is not working specifically .
it depends on the pleasure .
real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s are the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s are self @-@ awareness and peace .
real sum@@ s are ignored the printing of history , to meet tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
real sum@@ s are simple and original .
the real sum@@ s are God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God gave me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing this for a fixed rule , so that I could free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be that simple . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is wrong with me , how to work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , for I love it .
I &apos;m better than at home in the workplace .
this conf@@ ession is painful , for what a person prefer to be than to be a house ?
well , I think .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
we went around in the garden , before and back , round and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we are crushed soap bubbles .
thus I feel le@@ ased , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always act after my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fulfil@@ s me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever hear about playing ?
they can say it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and why don &apos;t you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me no more than 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , I replaced me a bug bug or cookie .
and speak my teen@@ ager daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes , more need it not need .
each can bring 15 minutes to a piece , even in a bad @-@ mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no de@@ fle@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children were ready to finish .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my delight , my world . it must not be the children . it is said to have the sum@@ s to have a place for peace of peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will cut and be victor@@ ious . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I was going to sur@@ pass more and more .
15 minutes on a piece , why not for a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s returned in my spare time . the sum@@ s would return to return unless I work .
work does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a couple of months , a door opens up and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown tune , she satis@@ fies me and my soul . she p@@ onder@@ ing me on new ideas . I am going to use it in full swing and love my work again .
I like the amount , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s are not me ... not anymore .
bubbles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
this now is my sum@@ s .
the Sum@@ ma of Life .
the Sum@@ ma of Love .
the tot@@ als of labour is part of me , but only one part . and therefore I am so grateful .
it is me schn@@ u@@ ppe that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play .
anyway , I put everything in a grip . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires burn .
the more I play , the more lucky I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I scre@@ am , the marathon , I run , the forces , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other sum@@ s are the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this amount , the more this unusual , descri@@ bing , naked and new feeling of life in me broad . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this amount , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I &apos;ll stir you back to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little bear@@ able .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
that is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve function through different surgical activities .
of course , they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; Tie@@ pe &quot; stimulation . &quot; so , you im@@ planted a electro@@ de in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function has improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson which suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however means not ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a guide and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often , I provided patients with brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a mel@@ low the brain and scal@@ ding the skull .
to save life , one has to reduce the skull of the skull .
sometimes you need to remove a partly s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to make cells of this tissue grow .
this is no easy task .
to make cells of a tissue grown , comparable to all small children , that are taken out of your family .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to prosp@@ er .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was abol@@ ished .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , mature cells .
maybe you know from the bi@@ onic class that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has master cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells were different .
they split slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so , we saw a new , strange cellular population that looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ m@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our bra@@ ins .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ell@@ um tum@@ our cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they cause the folding of the brain .
why are they supposed to get us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear , however -- by these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and afterwards they can highlight color in order to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we revised it at the sampling point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- auto @-@ transplan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we would like to see these cells in normal brain tissues ? and what will happen when we state the same cells in damaged brain tissues ?
with the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkey .
in the first scenario , we plan@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they had disappeared after a few weeks as if they had disappeared again . the room is already occupied , so they will not disappear there .
in the second scenario , we added an injury and em@@ bodies exactly the same cells and now the cells remain -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were not yet plan@@ ed .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells we make in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual speed task .
you had to take food pellets from one tray .
they made them very good .
when they had reached a stable level level , we passed the motor @-@ motor into the motor@@ ized Cor@@ tex .
the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , but they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen with people , they spont@@ ane@@ ously recre@@ ate themselves to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they are trying to recover with the aid of plastic brain mechanisms . you are re@@ covering to some degree just like the ap@@ es .
as we sure , the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous re@@ unification , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand they see the monkey that spont@@ ane@@ ously recre@@ ated .
he can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we stream@@ lined the cells : the same monkey , two months after the mat@@ ur@@ ation .
I can tell you , that were very exciting for us too .
since that time , we found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ om@@ ological models , for example at Par@@ kinson &apos;s .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant it with people .
I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain releases the means to cure herself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who need this . &quot;
I definitely will .
of course , the question of what the greatest h@@ ind@@ ran@@ ces are before you can begin clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest h@@ ind@@ ran@@ ces are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of Pap@@ ers and forms to pass these kinds of studies .
BG : that is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to start in the future as many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose the patients to perform and assess the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study .
first , you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer them to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s sure of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality but as a inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing conditions .
we believe that capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
this is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w from Singapore and his grand im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have doub@@ t@@ lessly proved that it is possible to have a th@@ ri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is overcome with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government - was un@@ am@@ big@@ uous to me as a finance minister in the euro@@ zone , the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not influence the savings programs that were realized in Greece .
in that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Communist Party of China , or some of my infl@@ ated friends who would repeat me that democracy was abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for genuine democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy , our societies are w@@ asted in our future , our future , and our great , new technologies .
in the topic of w@@ ast@@ age , I would like to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently threatened by our business .
I call it the &quot; twin summit Par@@ adox . &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt @-@ mountain that th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but few know its dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be sc@@ ared , however , to invest it , to invest it wherever it would be productive and gain to produce all the things that human@@ kind could produce , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested , as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , road tracks , equipment , and so on and so on .
3.4 billion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5.1 billion US dollars which are at the same time in the same lands and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ changes and dri@@ fting the property prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital are the twin summit which do not compens@@ ate by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low mac@@ ro@@ economic demand that could not invest in such a low demand in which they would not invest , that his son would kill him when he is growing up ,
invol@@ un@@ tary denied the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
this is my hair with the capitalism --
its extremely lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talent , and especially to finance the technology &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but I believe . but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le has defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was of course too many --
women , fore@@ ig@@ ner , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to minim@@ ise the employment rate of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these inclu@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long --
like a candle , the very bright lights , it is also quick to run .
however , our today liberal democracy have not democracy in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was focused on free citizens and the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ laws for ruler .
for the liberal democracy came only as a complete separation between politics and the economy and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , as the economy -- thus the world of corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ an @-@ free zone .
in our today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since that date , when this separation between politics and the economy began , an uner@@ ring struggle between the two taking place gradually relations between politics and economy .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are not so much more like before ?
it is not about de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because they cannot be in the government today and still not in power because the power of politics is ab@@ ander@@ ed into the economy and the areas separated .
I mentioned my hair with the capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about as a herd of prey that so sustain@@ ably the animals , from which it is nour@@ ished that it is star@@ ving towards the end .
similar to the economy , which policy has so far can@@ ni@@ fied by the self @-@ caused economic crisis , the power of the corpor@@ ations grows , the ine@@ quality is rising and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies .
the greater amount of capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ locate the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and fore@@ ig@@ ner .
this is not a new idea .
Marx@@ ist left this idea already 100 years ago and it did not very strange .
the doctrine of de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only recover a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers from automation and robot .
the problem is that , so long economic and politics are separated , the automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of sub@@ ordination , and social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the economy and policy , and make sure that we can democratic the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological supervision of hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which make the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , whether capitalism is the technical achievements of capitalism that he has caused to survive .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is super@@ se@@ ded by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that the society is working in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &apos; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long convers@@ ations the sense of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like a utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the field of companies : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital is working to you from one work@@ station to the next , and the company -- no matter which you are currently working -- is property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of labour labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between them that belong to the company , but they are not working in it , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong there . there is no pi@@ geon more between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and hair , and ultimately no recommended twin summit .
in the field of global political economy : please introduce yourself to a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency used by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment investors are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it &apos;s basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the 1944 Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference .
the problem was that one did not have the technical means to implement it .
today , we built them , especially in front of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe you is the same example , in whom they preferred privileged people , and mar@@ x@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the garbage dump of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we are awakening in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar de@@ yst@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it even more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography themselves as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : when something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... Do we do that , the technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand what Larry Sum@@ mers are called &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant .
just like Hay@@ ek , why am I a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes is , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are probably .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t think , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who mentioned it . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speaker you have clearly said what you keep from the point of view of the West to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy on politics , during the area where most plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ an @-@ free zone .
in a certain way , when I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative may say , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historical perc@@ ep@@ tible .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill . --
he was especially scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what you can watch now in China is much like the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to second .
now China has now acc@@ laimed to do what the West has done for itself in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many people are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I could say that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view@@ point , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make the euro@@ zone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that went through the euro@@ zone , continues to close the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal - by the way , the first proposal that denied this den@@ ial --
it is correct . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone remained the den@@ ial of the euro zone .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union .
if you try to obtain an economic system that is not vi@@ able by political will and auto mil@@ itar@@ ism , one may take out a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone would not have a future if we do not change their job .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back --
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who claims in office after 6 months , especially in such a reported situation , he did not have any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest error was to sign the extension of the debt @-@ program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors , to find a common solution .
but that did not happen .
they just wanted to bring our government to fall , only because they wanted to deal with the dist@@ or@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to ad@@ mit that she had been causing a cat@@ astro@@ phic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
worse than during the Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , they seem to be still quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone did not survive .
for if they did not survive , the released cent@@ rifu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and the European Union will destroy .
this will not have cat@@ astro@@ phic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
von Roy Price has never heard of the most , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision , which Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior expert at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slender , has a hed@@ gehog and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and content that will produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard bo@@ ther@@ ing industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he must find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this bend .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this assessment .
if your show is rated nine and higher , they will be a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows which have watched a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you what &apos;s going on at the end of the turn .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence in order to sub@@ ju@@ gate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
it makes more thoughts about the mean exp@@ ul@@ ment , average television -- the shows which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he is really at the right side .
the print is present and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something , therefore Roy Price does not want to risk for nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online , where they can watch any free .
and if Amazon returns for free things , do you get too , right ?
millions of viewers are viewing this episodes .
however , they do not know they are observed when looking at these shows .
you will be watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when to p@@ aus@@ ing which parts you start or looks at once again .
you collect millions of data to decide with this data then which Show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and hence the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four rep@@ ubli@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did the show .
anyone knows the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because they were not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House arrives at 7.5 -- thus a bit above average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
for the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always trying to find this a super show , but he &apos;s also uses data for it but it makes it different .
rather than arrange a competition , he and his team have watched out the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , thus the reviews that they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to figure out these little details about the audience : which shows they like which producers , which actors .
when they had assembled all those parts , they went out a chari@@ ot and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about an Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what has happened here ?
you have two very competent , data sealed up companies .
they combine these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision that one finds , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you &apos;re optimized it by very powerful computers .
the worst thing you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis does not work , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we use more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with that you are in prison .
if someone is here in the USA and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
Medi@@ oc@@ re TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , evidence is that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health System does not know how to use data .
also the data sealed firms lie un@@ true .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can pre@@ dict the influ@@ enza type of data analysis by Fl@@ u , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news of news . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a release in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it did not work , it was a sensation again , including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data you have sealed firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data retri@@ eved in decisions of life - at the workplace , in case of law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- a area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medicine . over the years I recognized some patterns through the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
if you want to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , make this problem in its individual parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place you put the individual parts back to touch a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : sit apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ comp@@ ose parts again and then join a decision .
there is another tool for this and we have it all : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is well preserved parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to express a good decision - especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and mind , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . however , the decision on how to put all these parts again and set up a show like &quot; House of Cards . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that she received a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they chose TV ideas , then choose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to be forgotten , this device is quite useful .
many of you will become ...
before there was data , this was the machine for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Y@@ A@@ - or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will later do it with a technical demo .
I have made some decisions in my life so far , where I should listen to the ball in the night .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , perhaps the ball is cl@@ erg@@ ers and cl@@ erg@@ ers . ultimately it is in us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encour@@ aging message that , despite the large crowd of data , make it out to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks to go on .
for at the end , it is not the data , but the risks to land at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
