<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">She might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone listening to Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he showed the NSA illegal from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should be left a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In it, he describes a catastrophic US secret operation, in which the CIA overtook literally designs for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, you read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter does not like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government was determined against iron and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the patterns of government, Whistleblowers and obscoring journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media cannot get these information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they are reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government approached Risen, he did something that many brave reporter did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen has lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though for many years it had been vital for their case, the claims of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide fewer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and dismissants to make statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, got his phoning, secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as its e-mail data, financial and banchinformation, its credit information, and even travel tips with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA whistleblower and tear.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments over him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government grew too much from its work as being secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September, almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistleblower went into one journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we place the corporate work on the game, which should be protected by the first constituary, because the government has more possibilities to spy out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But equally as technology of the government allows to bypass the rights of replicans, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, they can hold that from the moment they are in contact, instead of resting, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software which hasn't existed when Risen has written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is a SecureDrop, an open source shift system for Whistleblowers, which was originally developed from the internet world, developed by us, and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload files or send information so as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot procure more information, and many of the information it would request it would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is however only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that all endangers us all over the world.</seg>

<seg id="39">The lack of abuse during the supply of soldiers humd knows and reported by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a wall street insider that warns us in front of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constitutions.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016] [the "Panama Papers" was released,] [the "Panama Papers"] [which means that the rich and powerful] [enormous sum of money] have been hidden in tax havases.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness around a statement.] This week we were asked of news about a leak of 11 million documents published in Panama's law firm Mosel Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as mossy Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that one ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead to a narrow friend of children days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people and others who are nervous on the next release, and wait for the next release documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that tackle us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havases and not all have to pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by a few minutes to hide their assets and to veg -- something we have been discussing and unveil for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will confuse this entire world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it is like a Matrjog Capuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company what it nearly impossible to understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that in the USA there are fewer reports on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no famous Americans that occurred in these revelations, such scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that are under control in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which these tax havases work, Moselle Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands, or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see lots more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US States less information needs to give less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of incentive in the USA has allowed some school districts to leave school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to zoom in, particularly vulnerable trailers.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to figure out how all of this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">Thus, we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 woody companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our agent gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring some money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="76">This was all prejudice. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over money to anybody. but this is the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer, who made suggestions in our concealed investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leading politicians, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we must change rules of rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound much more energetic, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing would ever have changed; as if it always will ever be the wealthy and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I am quite happy that some have started changing.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen ahead to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has captured central registers at the national level, who is really behind firms in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary procedures, but this does not imply the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge glimpse into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people that are furious when they see how others can hide their real identity behind headlamps.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy that rise up and say, "Intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians, who know the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally stop this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the boot of a red Mazda race.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design study, I completed a farm.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda did not sit and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in town and made a roadtrip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he tells me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was getting late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake it asking: "where do you sleep for tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He got the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What can I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know it! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Do you like?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I froze on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what happened to me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild boar sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I climbed up out of the bed, to toe on toe and my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he purchased from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in a stranger was, were friends who just waited for it?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate draws and the rent is lifted.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at the time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can be able to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and partner Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could do something about it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and started as "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at our top floor for 20 dollars on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham Omelettes tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door went into the castle, Brian and I went on.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to post a site, on which people have public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms and the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in consolation would invest in a shop that permits strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When one has a problem, one tells about things that you can make. we could be designed.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design work such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with the design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a sample, what degree we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. you will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your locked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic that you feel right now -- -- is exactly what will feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel about holding the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please call on Twitter that he is responsible for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phone now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour could only have imagined with his name; if he had told what he comes from, how his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you'd have 150 prejudices that all say: "he can really hold out mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you'd have to leave your phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-thought feedback system makes trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning, we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative complaint.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both the host and guest were handed over, before we asked them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford which is how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are related to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">A little surprising we trust in people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting if one adds to the call of a person -- in our case by Beurries.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three orders, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">Good reputation set out similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much one is reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you're talking about too little like Hi!, you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">As for example, too much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I'm working with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I furnish it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to deposit these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people will take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly, unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business has just been very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have celebrated parties celebrated or have spoiled flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Our host have guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust became broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts even if I think only about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which you hear in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, there was only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust in a row.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, Wonderful may arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers to tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra is real guardian angels who save lives, even though they do not know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they get books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay one even longer without charging additional extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not everybody is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">For the first time I stumbled across this concept, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions work together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economical trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now it's just a "rental industry" to call, the thing is not just being justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself open, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">Today, if you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if one had to wait for every place that would be visited a group there would be a thorough reconstruction, and show you one out with a Kneipentour district, from which you have never heard about it;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would it look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have thought of a shared share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which enable us to find society and relations, instead of loneliness and scotation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project started in South Korea's capital of Seoul. lots of parking which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now available to residents. students who were searching for an stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were sent to people whose children were moved. there were incubators programs included,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger or self-host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We invented the wheel not new.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar web sites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this astounding,</seg>
<seg id="251">Just overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda rides me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design can not solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwash brainwash, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For anyone who has never met a Muslim: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee designer -- doublespresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchide-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sing, for baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have chosen to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends but as Muslims. I decided to wear Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why are you oppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was, then it was a feminist independence day for me, and compared to the print I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been struggling with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought that was questioning, doubting and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow surrender that deepen with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm is sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt the feeling you perceive, you fully understands, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started to like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">Sitting in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked to the screen and looked at the word "Breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into anger.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard them... "..." Muslim terrorists "..."... "" "" ""... "..."... "..."... "..."...</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the nu turned me the deeds of one citizen into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">That same day we had to go through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember what I drove -- as we were silent -- so deeply I went in my seat, and I feared the first time I was being recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw and read the warnings of the National islamic organisations that said: "be vigilant," "If be careful" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed all week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings said: "don't go to this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw my extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who kept for Muslims to break and beat them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really surfences on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have mastered the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love issues.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays, we can actually tell people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor remains only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, aesthetic and Olympionics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Czech in America make it safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting a mosque makes people to consider other faith tolerant, and show more citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="333">As a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not radical in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">You will be radicalizing in your cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">The radicalization process has been noted that it begins online. as a first, the person from her church is cut off, even from her family to say that the extremisty of terrorists say that the facts are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhornate their behavior and ideology, is a traitor or fallen from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS uses their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As the Muslim, as a mother, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imagination, when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clarifier with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you throw a look at them, they do not suffer what they read in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">A outstanding imam told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she imagined she could join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was just the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world would only bring her in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing but gave sense to their anger, she was a main goal for instrumental virtualization by extremists giving up a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse her anger, he showed a constructive way of a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does normal Americans look like?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affects everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption be consumed by fear every day based on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show if we fear we happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian governmental system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if one has reported Tested news, in which negative was reported about Muslims, they agree to military attacks on Muslims in Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only a joke problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims, between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never happened in connection with terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the beginning of the war against Iraq and during two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to raise the foundation of a free society, rational and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We perhaps feel it the first, but the toxic air of fear hines us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective innocence it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented, talented and promising at the dental faculty...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous man whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did my bridge have become such a savvy young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting the afternoon. he did in her apartment as when he posted comments against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the Mosque or were we safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We examined silence with our son in the children's seat, high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and drew up my shoes, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, kept myself.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then Imam had an announcement, thanked and called our guests, as the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, creditors and non-believers who had come to attack us, but to assist.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion towards panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join them that mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say you think that you are holding a TEDTalk, a monument with draught, in a classy thought factory, i.e. an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive you. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem to appear as a rule, usually the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: many thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters is about to become a billions of billions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcels are invaded into our social awareness, autonomous fleet of air machines in the FRAC Centre was built live in France on a six-metre high tower. some years ago, they started flying with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting to these airways, airinstruments achieve high speed and acceleration in the same space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can build independently of inaccessible structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens that deal with turbulence and to react in general on natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">Thus a system autonomous works, it has to know collective sheid where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are provided on the highest level. e.g., "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrwhisers it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starting blocks, it can float, and has great benefits for launch and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal location can be recovered and performance by practicing can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract ideas that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts, which accumulate in order to harm you.</seg>
<seg id="434">For decades, trained pilots couldn't fly far controlled airways that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Long ago, we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospelan, the mechanically simulated flying machine. it was invented in short time.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No gaps, hinges and cross ruding, no further instincts or control surfaces, just one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside the inner life a lot so that it can fly stable and can move in space everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">But it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear window. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability that it is correct if all look at me is slight, so I'll show you a video which was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospan is an exercise in genelty, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this excess?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is equivalent to its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">He receives the extraordinary skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even like it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">It is quite complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Quite can be offered in models, the rest is learned directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see it.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines should be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong, the engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery - the machine can fly further, if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took Commercial Micro-Quadra -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room she is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, these demonstrations motivate to rethink new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us lies the reward in development and production act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economical potential is the tittle on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far distant galaxy were getting faster, they turned the mass of three planes in a tenth of a second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This very short moment, they turned brighter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not put them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was handed over into the space-time structure and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has spared a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing at -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector by the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech to create a giant laser detector that are caused by colliating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as a crazy comies, so that U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometry Gravitational-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be considerably increased, which greatly improved the recognition rate.</seg>
<seg id="483">Thus it is called the Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo started clearing some smaller, stubborn problems for a last attempt.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the detectors of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes caused through the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the leave of my todsick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating Gravitational waves of black holes and their observatory such as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crusory within the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By passing the shaft, the space and its overall content will be stretched in a direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers in courses lead to the theory of relativity often a really albernal dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, expand and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each one of us stretched out the waves and ended up. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. then said the Ligo employees for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be precisely measured on less than a thousand radius of a nuclear power radius. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Drive Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties of building such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are finnish and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is to be more an ear as an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by keeping the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen according to specific properties such as pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make easy images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by keeping changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">If we convert wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear the All literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">Now the gravity is listening to about the collision of two black holes, what my colleague Scott tells a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, easily: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn out the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same curls with an additional toning change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of motion sensor, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo following: [Surrender of the sound] No one know what he must hear is known as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times per solar mass, which about as fast as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we think about what it means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dicheted body in All, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 probes, revolve about one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine that forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein consists the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe, as never before was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or generally -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about things.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen in the heart, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is covered by his own luminaires.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see, and of whom we have never seen. things we just discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found the first attempt to get things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak of the bone knock for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us to have a completely different viewing angle on events in space, on the creation of the stars and ultimately, as we emerged from this mayhem.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories - a completely new generation of Observatories on Earth and in All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be better than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would say "Yes!" I feared that I feared me.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it was nervous that brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I have to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted me to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, I feared that, my fear removed.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep speeches, my social anxiety - puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain thing that changed my life, definitely unexpectedly. it started with a question of my infants.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the Kleinste, is calling for inexplicable reasons all. "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"sweethme, I need milk for my whisper."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me whether I could play with her when I was just on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of life in my family. from there I bothered to play with them once you go to it. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am trying very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently, I was completely understood that the "Yes" swages to play with my children to save my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a author. I think things out and feel free to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No, not.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I press television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for applying 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode of four days four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which simultaneously in production are four times four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">In the whole world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I created themselves, and not only produced, so still obscure. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell you, because I know what you think is the word "author."</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of them that work so hard for you to take a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, so you understand that I'm not just roaring around the computer, and it is correct if I say: I don't understand that I don't miss a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything that is reality, all blood, all sweat - no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I was engrossed in my work, there is no different feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set up troops, as a painting I found on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you carry a high sound, cover a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all of that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, sounding and maternal, cruelly and rational. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is well underway.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begin in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sum sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate if I tell them the sums that I persuade it to give me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with the television production, when I began to work and work, build and work, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The amount is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums are God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot look different than in size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that cannot be different compared to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a titanium, and I know I don't want it to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I get, the more episodes, the more points, the more things at the same time, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more it I write history.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the hum, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this amount. I love the amount.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the amount of sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, overrun.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth, that their mama is a single employer.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper told people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my niece."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "sweethearts, I want to go to Shonda on land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work anymore. the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, not delegates, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an advance show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just didn't have fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums were me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what if you do, what to do, the work you love suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some might think: "grasshopper you, stupid Author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you do, you're doing it, you're working, one loves you to be a banker, a banker, a girl, if you know the sums, and know how to stop the sums, when the sums stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states' waitress" asked me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm on the way out, getting late, and she says: "mum, you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than to know me two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, they were not called "Evaluator."</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "laurels."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did it happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I passe it, if I feel Titan and my sums, and here all changes my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters stumble, we laugh a lot and I'm reading very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of summing, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, watchwords and the song in which it goes slogans, or whatever the girl in "The Eisqueen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in that place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me loosens.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and a burst of energy is coming.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right away, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full noise, hardly there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">Now, now, I feel as I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we've forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself from broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot about what the real sums are.</seg>
<seg id="707">The amount is not power and it is not working specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums are the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums are ignored the printing of history, to meet tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">Real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums are God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God gave me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this for a fixed rule, so that I could free myself as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be that simple. I'm not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is wrong with me, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, for I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I'm better than at home in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what a person prefer to be than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I think.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan."</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We went around in the garden, before and back, round and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We are crushed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Thus I feel leased, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always act after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever hear about playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">They can say it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And why don't you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It's just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me no more than 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, I replaced me a bug bug or cookie.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenager daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's only 15 minutes, more need it not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring 15 minutes to a piece, even in a bad-mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no deflection.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children were ready to finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my delight, my world. it must not be the children. it is said to have the sums to have a place for peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I will cut and be victorious. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I was going to surpass more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on a piece, why not for a full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums returned in my spare time. the sums would return to return unless I work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a couple of months, a door opens up and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown tune, she satisfies me and my soul. she pondering me on new ideas. I am going to use it in full swing and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the amount, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums are not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This now is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summa of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summa of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The totals of labour is part of me, but only one part. and therefore I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me schnuppe that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="780">Anyway, I put everything in a grip. my brain is still working. my bonfires burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more lucky I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I scream, the marathon, I run, the forces, the screens, the sums, the sums, the sums, the other sums are the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this amount, the more this unusual, describing, naked and new feeling of life in me broad. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this amount, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things out, I'll stir you back to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little bearable.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, who tries to improve the nerve function through different surgical activities.</seg>
<seg id="804">Of course, they have heard of one of the most known, the "Tiepe" stimulation. "so, you implanted a electrode in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function has improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however means not neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a guide and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often, I provided patients with brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that brain-brain traumata mellow the brain and scalding the skull.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to reduce the skull of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a partly swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to make cells of this tissue grow.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To make cells of a tissue grown, comparable to all small children, that are taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, mature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know from the bionic class that stem cells are unmature cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has master cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So, we saw a new, strange cellular population that looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublemortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brains.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellum tumour cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they cause the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">Why are they supposed to get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- by these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And afterwards they can highlight color in order to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we revised it at the sampling point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- auto-transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we would like to see these cells in normal brain tissues? and what will happen when we state the same cells in damaged brain tissues?</seg>
<seg id="857">With the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we planed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they had disappeared after a few weeks as if they had disappeared again. the room is already occupied, so they will not disappear there.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added an injury and embodies exactly the same cells and now the cells remain -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were not yet planed.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells we make in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual speed task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable level level, we passed the motor-motor into the motorized Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">The monkeys were paralyzed, but they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they spontaneously recreate themselves to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they are trying to recover with the aid of plastic brain mechanisms. you are recovering to some degree just like the apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">As we sure, the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous reunification, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand they see the monkey that spontaneously recreated.</seg>
<seg id="874">He can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we streamlined the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, that were very exciting for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathomological models, for example at Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain releases the means to cure herself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know somebody who need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely will.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what the greatest hindrances are before you can begin clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest hindrances are the authorities. starting from these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of Papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delikat, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to start in the future as many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">It depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to choose the patients to perform and assess the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer them to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's sure of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as a inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging conditions.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his grand imitators in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is overcome with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government - was unambiguous to me as a finance minister in the eurozone, the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not influence the savings programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my inflated friends who would repeat me that democracy was abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are wasted in our future, our future, and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">In the topic of wastage, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our business.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt-mountain that throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few know its dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is to be scared, however, to invest it, to invest it wherever it would be productive and gain to produce all the things that humankind could produce, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars were invested, as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, road tracks, equipment, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 billion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it with the 5.1 billion US dollars which are at the same time in the same lands and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and drifting the property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital are the twin summit which do not compensate by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low macroeconomic demand that could not invest in such a low demand in which they would not invest, that his son would kill him when he is growing up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntary denied the circumstances causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with the capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talent, and especially to finance the technology "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But I believe. but before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle has defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy was of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigner, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to minimise the employment rate of Athenian democracy due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, the very bright lights, it is also quick to run.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today liberal democracy have not democracy in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy was focused on free citizens and the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a bylaws for ruler.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only as a complete separation between politics and the economy and the democratic process was bordered on politics, as the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democratian-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today's democracies, since that date, when this separation between politics and the economy began, an unerring struggle between the two taking place gradually relations between politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are not so much more like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because they cannot be in the government today and still not in power because the power of politics is abandered into the economy and the areas separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with the capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about as a herd of prey that so sustainably the animals, from which it is nourished that it is starving towards the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similar to the economy, which policy has so far cannified by the self-caused economic crisis, the power of the corporations grows, the inequality is rising and the managing director of the corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The greater amount of capitalism drives the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to relocate the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">Marxist left this idea already 100 years ago and it did not very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only recover a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers from automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that, so long economic and politics are separated, the automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste of subordination, and social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reshape the economy and reunite the economy and policy, and make sure that we can democratic the reunified field, otherwise we end in a pathological supervision of hyperautocracy which make the movie "Matrix" like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, whether capitalism is the technical achievements of capitalism that he has caused to survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is superseded by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or by something that the society is working in "Star Trek" or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians' Agora, "in long conversations the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what could it look like this "Star Trek" like a utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar Dystia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital is working to you from one workstation to the next, and the company -- no matter which you are currently working -- is property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and redeeming and the concept of labour labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between them that belong to the company, but they are not working in it, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong there. there is no pigeon more between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and hair, and ultimately no recommended twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please introduce yourself to a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency used by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment investors are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It's basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we built them, especially in front of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe you is the same example, in whom they preferred privileged people, and marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the garbage dump of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We are awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar deystia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it even more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography themselves as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: when something of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and the economy is... Do we do that, the technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand what Larry Summers are called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, why am I a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes is, and that's why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are probably.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't think, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, who mentioned it. BG: in your presentation, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speaker you have clearly said what you keep from the point of view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy on politics, during the area where most plays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratian-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, when I may say that provocative may say, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historical perceptible.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill. --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch now in China is much like the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now China has now acclaimed to do what the West has done for itself in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many people are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I could say that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal viewpoint, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make the eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the complacency, and the permanent denial that went through the eurozone, continues to close the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal - by the way, the first proposal that denied this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is correct. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone remained the denial of the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to obtain an economic system that is not viable by political will and auto militarism, one may take out a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone would not have a future if we do not change their job.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back --</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, who claims in office after 6 months, especially in such a reported situation, he did not have any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was to sign the extension of the debt-program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the donors, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not happen.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government to fall, only because they wanted to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that she had been causing a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Worse than during the Great Depression. "</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika's Troika, who imposed this policy on us, confessed: "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, they seem to be still quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and the European Union will destroy.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>

<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Von Roy Price has never heard of the most, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision, which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior expert at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and content that will produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard bothering industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated nine and higher, they will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones", "The Wire" -- all the shows which have watched a season, your brain asks, "Where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you what's going on at the end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't care about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence in order to subjugate "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">It makes more thoughts about the mean expulment, average television -- the shows which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really at the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is present and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something, therefore Roy Price does not want to risk for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online, where they can watch any free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon returns for free things, do you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are viewing this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are observed when looking at these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when to pausing which parts you start or looks at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with this data then which Show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and hence the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did the show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Anyone knows the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because they were not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House arrives at 7.5 -- thus a bit above average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">For the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always trying to find this a super show, but he's also uses data for it but it makes it different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than arrange a competition, he and his team have watched out the existing data on the Netflix viewer, thus the reviews that they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to figure out these little details about the audience: which shows they like which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had assembled all those parts, they went out a chariot and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about an Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so, exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competent, data sealed up companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision that one finds, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You're optimized it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The worst thing you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, this is a bit scary because we live in a time in which we use more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with that you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is here in the USA and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, evidence is that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that is not because a company like Multi-Health System does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data sealed firms lie untrue.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can predict the influenza type of data analysis by Flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news of news. success culminated in a release in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It did not work, it was a sensation again, including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data you have sealed firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data retrieved in decisions of life - at the workplace, in case of law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- a area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I recognized some patterns through the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you want to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, make this problem in its individual parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place you put the individual parts back to touch a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: sit apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to recompose parts again and then join a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is well preserved parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to express a good decision - especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and mind, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they wouldn't have been capable of. however, the decision on how to put all these parts again and set up a show like "House of Cards."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that she received a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they chose TV ideas, then choose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to be forgotten, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will become...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the machine for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a YA- or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely," right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later do it with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions in my life so far, where I should listen to the ball in the night.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end, perhaps the ball is clergers and clergers. ultimately it is in us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the large crowd of data, make it out to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks to go on.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For at the end, it is not the data, but the risks to land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
