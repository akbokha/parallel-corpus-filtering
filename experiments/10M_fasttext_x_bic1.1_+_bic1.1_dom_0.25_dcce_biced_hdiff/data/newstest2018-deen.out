Munich 1856 : four maps that change your view to the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people will meet today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is dug up .
small gar@@ den@@ ers in@@ hib@@ its the former bottom of farmers .
the oldest official card mou@@ ths encour@@ ages exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when maps are not current .
this knows everyone who had to ex@@ u@@ gh himself , because the car Nav@@ i took place in a green lawn instead of a walk @-@ up road .
historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the State Government , are anything but currently quite illumin@@ ating .
especially when compar@@ ing them with current online maps .
it will then be clear how towns and communities have changed the scope of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a fli@@ cker carpet , which one does not realise as such .
in the great coverage map for cities and communities more detailed maps , so @-@ called jud@@ ging sheets .
these were produced according to the Bavarian State Investig@@ ation between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and bor@@ rowed the first survey@@ ing Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the fall of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon had received an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 at the end : there were today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria @-@ card .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian State Bureau .
the primary data sheet of Munich origin@@ ates from the year 1856 and is available as any other on the Bay@@ er@@ isches Land website .
the comparison to early / day is the most impressive of the country &apos;s capital .
the city expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub @-@ send@@ ed@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , in 1877 , when Munich area was founded .
today is the middle of the city in the middle of the city .
the houses were concentrated in 1856 along the Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße that was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian peas@@ ant uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the west park is , one sees no more than fields - at first sight : a smaller @-@ part map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; which has been derived from the basic tax .
today , small plots spread over there no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green space is drawn from the north of the sub@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 was the place of the Oktober@@ fest in the 19th century , was actually a meadow and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the background of the area Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen in the area of the area Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one does not only read the road name &quot; on the air pastry &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field Road one once locked people with incredible shots .
in 1858 / 59 , the Munich @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was founded &quot; On the Au@@ er air . &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the establishment of that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the purchase of the so @-@ called Irish .
he has also forbidden the personnel to make violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who deals for an exhibition with An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients , initially a place was extended , later was expanded to 500 seats .
at some point this capacity did not give up more - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in the hair of 1905 .
since 2006 Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry .
young people are now meeting in the Sal@@ es@@ ian Sal@@ es@@ ians in the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order gained the building complex in 1920 and converted it to a Youth house with vocational training .
the west location of the TS@@ V München Ost , east of East residential buildings from the 1980s .
the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in 2015 - based on an architectural heritage of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt which was destroyed during the World War II by bombing .
the Marien@@ platz was registered as a &quot; main place &quot; in 1856 , the department name was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
a decisive change provided the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the Allied bom@@ b@@ ings had many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - on the Marien@@ hof .
the English Institut , small business buildings and a group chapel from the Middle Ages were once on the Marien@@ hof , where these days work and on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn order is carried out .
the old Munich map with the sli@@ der can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
civil association publishes Travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ored has issued a warning for coloured people who travel due to disc@@ rimin@@ ant policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , is to bring special attention to the state , because a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based prevention will occur in the whole state and reported here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to win disc@@ rimin@@ ators , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , the disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to min@@ orities , caused the group to release their war@@ nings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; you have injuries of civil rights , which happen to humans .
they will be stopped because of their skin color , they are joined or killed , &quot; said the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear problems in such a frequency which we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
the reported inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist violations of black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under un@@ question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline during his journey through the state and accused by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the offices of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which black drivers in the state will be more common in the state 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees tell about what happened in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be willing to bring their money , or to know the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i experienced a year in 2015 , after the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ il@@ crime Programme of the FB@@ I , who rec@@ alls the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it difficult to su@@ e a company for employment or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel war@@ nings issued for Texas and Arizona , after the United States adopted immig@@ ration authorities to ban people because of mig@@ rat@@ ory fail@@ ures , which will contribute to further breeding rules in the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel war@@ nings are usually exhibited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately they have employed the action as response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
turn@@ dec@@ eption project is elementary
the f@@ fence project &apos;s f@@ fence project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CDU of the German parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have obtained a picture on @-@ site .
at the sp@@ acy of the Schwen@@ demann family , the representative of the fisher@@ man &apos;s parliament together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties met .
Markus Schwen@@ demann comm@@ utes into his farm into his farm where he is cultivated in 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ ittens .
for him , the Black Forest of milk is the alternative distributor trail for the milk of its cows , so ji@@ b .
at the table of guests only Region@@ als .
since he is also a &quot; elementary project &quot; which is also important as a &quot; elementary school &quot; in Fis@@ bach , he also called &quot; elementary project . &quot;
I can not manage on such steep faces .
the green area is working for a lot of work , to be edited with the sense sense .
&quot; we strug@@ gled with the conditions and to fight with top@@ ography , &quot; emphas@@ ised Schwen@@ demann .
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and manage these without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead to a bio@@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the Leader . &quot;
with a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare would have to be supported by farmers .
it is hop@@ eful that , for a while , the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation of surfaces could be moved out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor .
farmers are often represented in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 par@@ cels were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants .
the re@@ tention area is therefore 40 hectares , which cannot be re@@ constructed until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs of 71 500 euros , half of the Leader is promoted , a quarter owed to the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
thus , the farmers stay 12 billion euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained y@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job without farmers and farmers do not work . &quot;
also for Peter White got firm : &quot; best food will be produced here . &quot;
the national park fle@@ dge line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state subsi@@ ding of pasture .
the aim is to maintain the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald &apos;s shift .
the presence of a subsi@@ dies recorded by the L@@ PR is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite .
in addition , the enclosed area must not be bad ( han@@ ger by 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the re@@ aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation .
the application of eight atten@@ de@@ es with 24 plots , which aim to build up about 16 kilometres of fence for the f@@ ad@@ versary project 2018 .
the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump bears the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack the statues instead .
the Americans just appreciate these as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall Saddam Hussein &apos;s place at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ cost@@ a of CN@@ N on the proposals by the President to the dra@@ stic restriction of legal Immig@@ ration with the Statue of Liberty .
to keep fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself .
a Hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty im@@ itation have he suffered him , if he had done it .
but he seized the meaning , and in particular the importance of her was entru@@ sted to her as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , who was built 17 years after the completion of the monument to his base .
when Miller &apos;s A@@ cost@@ a said : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem is based on which you have been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
it lies appropri@@ ately , but how he formulated it , does not really go about history .
it is about the contemp@@ or@@ tive words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only re@@ charges an old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your mos@@ quit@@ oes , your poor , and your troubled masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the afflicted falling of thy rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; saving waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ ump United States .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : in fact , a conflict is about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who were interested in placing their words after their death - knew very well that they had done a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American public@@ ans , showing them in an un@@ used classical visual representation of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed the meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no more abstract - it has received a voice .
and she has a different name for himself : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem by the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change their right wing from the right wing .
the big scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty came to the Statue of Liberty , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative daily that raises the American flame into the world : &quot; Lady Liberty is prec@@ eded .
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not shine through the way to the United States . &quot;
it was quite unusual at Lim@@ bau@@ gh here .
the meaning of the statue is wholly and a question of stand@@ point of perception .
the great fan@@ ciful act was by Lazarus in order to see how they drew from the , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it is in the true sense that the world comes from a perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue refers to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective of Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine through the way , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ oses Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds of a time when only two S@@ ans belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of world champion is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
black believes that &quot; something special is developing in Scotland &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom had to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we find out , &quot; Black .
&quot; I am speaking with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics Men : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals gi@@ ants , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was made a team captain from the team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes whether they were Scottish , or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very motivated and were highly motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth world championships with 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says it &apos;s unbelievable , that 16 sco@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes during World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
this path ben@@ ds left out five British and two European records in the past year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Scot@@ s@@ man who was to watch the victory at the British team of Trieste and the Anniversary Games after a great season .
Do@@ yle is re@@ minded of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man at the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what makes a special team for the team to be so that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it anyway was a great honour to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and voted for something special to me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to go on po@@ di@@ ums .
what does my speech affect as captain ?
yes , I think they went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block Crit@@ ics on Facebook : do not apply to a public office if you can &apos;t fuel the fuel of v@@ oters
the father of our land knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of the internal policy up to its political principles .
he shr@@ ink with criticism , for sure .
but he did not put his critics into silence .
for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; The Re@@ def@@ ences can be removed - and , dum@@ b and mu@@ te we will be led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Mar@@ yland to Governor Larry H@@ ogan who needs to work more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans members have blocked the contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their opinions published on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union failed to rev@@ ise it at the beginning of this week .
the Bar @-@ govern@@ ors dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ - and the online commentary was full of a counter response with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it &apos;s a guy like H@@ ogan .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in a stunning democratic state which is aston@@ ishing popular .
he has the second highest vote of the 50 govern@@ ors in the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary Hitler head .
it has shown fixed hand on the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a priority means to connect with his v@@ oters and end his ha@@ iled head after chemotherapy on his side .
hence the blocking of people who come to the site of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is considered officially and from employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ending H@@ og@@ ans Spe@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ings of the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of tro@@ ll@@ ables or sp@@ amm@@ ers or p@@ asser@@ ted people , which vibr@@ ate online the lashes .
the mail talked with some of the real people who have been blocked by H@@ ogan .
and they are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful , and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans in Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ le , but she asked for H@@ ass@@ ver@@ rupt .
&quot; I commented polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other latest news , &quot; wrote it in the commentary volume of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the govern@@ ors described as &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack , &quot; others might probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or delete a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but exactly this just happened .
H@@ ogan is not the first public officials who critic@@ ises that he has vacc@@ inated Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users , which were blocked by his Twitter feeds .
one of the first milest@@ ones in this question happened last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County announced the first am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. Ambassador James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a v@@ oters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use on Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be that hard .
at the time of Washington the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers killed between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brie@@ fing stood on his leadership .
and Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s at that time .
the people who used P@@ seud@@ ony@@ me as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers who rep@@ ented Washington &apos;s decisions .
Pet@@ itions , who also critic@@ ised his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade , and navigation with Britain , has overcome his office , according to historical documents which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put them into silence .
freedom of expression , differences of opinion and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic convenience to the Renaissance club
the former European Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of home comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian had been organizing the 25th edition of the Scottish senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which lost in the last year in the arch@@ er@@ field , left until the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , with the new venue and acts as tournament sp@@ ies on behalf of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ a@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state .
Jerry made a great job , when he was able to fix this place .
he is an eag@@ erly supp@@ orter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player developed in South@@ port .
&quot; I can &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because it was in the year after having won her from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour in this year , returns to the European Youth Day after his 50th birthday .
this event will be his first Scottish gig since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel that additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty .
OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sco@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Ber@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ st@@ ir , and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 a car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer through pas@@ siv@@ ity
fewer people have died in the last two decades about passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are considered to be this result .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 kidney cancer cases can be attributed to passive smoking , &quot; said studies manager Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he drew up an own study of the 1994 issue .
at that time there were still 400 recur@@ ring cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections are considered very complex
construction works in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and are reason@@ ably located in time , &quot; says the manager of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the in@@ sides , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of hidden underground in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which always under@@ lines the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ y .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of drivers &quot; red lights and shut@@ ters is already tremendous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to travel .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ y have been busy with working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite tough already .
but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Cost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use any stove .
they even rarely uses a pot .
in her wood house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ele in the troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually lays a sweet potatoes - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the c@@ ots are harvested with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture , where she performs its daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
most of her husband &apos;s four wives of her husband were assigned no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be too dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink it , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; nobody had to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare glimp@@ se of the daily life in the Hochland of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 to a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders had to vote against the occupying forces .
an existing move , which def@@ ending for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region , which exclu@@ des any foreign journalists or ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , although the independent part of Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as was included in the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province Capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car driver by car .
there are no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo forests , and made of corrugated art@@ ments , which were converted by rust in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have done their journey here , for journalists prof@@ ane and practically no fore@@ ig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrive , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua moved to a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and suggests its lively , hand woven tur@@ ban , you dar@@ ker shirt and her bright rock .
&quot; earlier we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst conditions of children in Asia .
but there is also Indonesia gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed at 3.1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua offers wood@@ resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
but these riches are , however , a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s military has preserved a ch@@ oked presence .
a study conducted in 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ o@@ an demands of greater autonomy threat@@ ening this golden d@@ ans and are treated mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess .
according to various activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned .
mass econom@@ ies in Pap@@ u@@ as St@@ ron@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became related to the Asia Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demon@@ strat@@ ors in the past year alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week happen inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensi@@ fied because pap@@ u@@ as resources run a Zu@@ stream of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing , as Muslim economic mig@@ rant workers are from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ins sell chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people struggle to stop here .
&quot; the migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ be@@ th You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local which moved to the province Capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it took the local Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; of women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ el Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the national and Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to ban the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann occupies 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua it has changed little , and today the locals feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that it will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep entry only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang a Christmas Car@@ ols in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke off on a motorbike through the darkness .
the children &apos;s fri@@ ghtened children said they should go on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a blast by their tone and returned later with four soldiers , local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their rif@@ le iron , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers hum@@ ed into the group of children .
a child who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ ulated Y@@ ei@@ mo , was struck so hard that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission was set fire and the situation escal@@ ated the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua women , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they carried in cerem@@ on@@ ial hunting bu@@ cks and led the orph@@ aned dance - in the circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demon@@ strat@@ ors began to draw stones to police and military staff .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent by an internal radio command : &quot; when the masses were more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and called for the quantity to return home .
one no one was to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left hand basin , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
kay@@ aks still not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , a witness to the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and bes@@ ought his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Chief Spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to secure their station , &quot; they wanted to be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threatened to kill us , &quot; said spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demon@@ strat@@ ors were killed and many others injured .
the news on the notes came only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura made a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced to express authority for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to the historical ab@@ normal@@ ities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he put an extra@@ judi@@ cial mechanism to the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occ@@ ured before long time .
some were in the 90s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; he said .
he then made a withdrawal when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he had no plans to set a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
Esper@@ anto , having been indicted by the UN for crimes against humanity , accused of having already settled more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &quot; independence from 1999 that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai attacks .
family of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with fierce dis@@ belief .
&quot; I inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear of years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the cast@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a farmer , who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children too .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
adv@@ ancing vill@@ agers from the firm &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers put stones upon officers who responded to it by dro@@ pping warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started to shoot the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who dwell in the vicinity of the hospital , and witness how the last ones were delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on to withdraw the involved officials and pull the mobile Brigade of the police out of the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an anti @-@ herd for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development rein@@ forces the dis@@ content of the ancestors Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by sp@@ ending spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ cat@@ K@@ og@@ oya .
in the last few years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and were arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some never stop again .
among men in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a tragic , forget@@ ful place . &quot;
poverty is strengthening its dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals too .
bread is exactly out of reach .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields on the sweet potatoes .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold in the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a cost only 10,000 ind@@ ones@@ ian Rup@@ iah ( 75 cents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities are grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new floo@@ ding .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually to the better trained and weal@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete in their own business .
&quot; the young people are not interested in keeping in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of international media reports remain ten@@ se .
due to lack of coordination with turned institutions from Pap@@ ua , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the Pro@@ mises Of Jok@@ ow@@ is Election , was unable to raise the restrictions of reporting , not to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and West pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a declaration .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the Indonesian government .
in March , six p@@ aired states - Ton@@ ga , N@@ aur@@ u , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ ans and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and widely distributed injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have been histor@@ ically supported by the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it &apos;s difficult to shed the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people like to be aware that more foreign governments should take this knowledge .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights ambassador , Ke@@ es Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; in line with a source that also wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua must say that they probably won &apos;t go back for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that it is under the constant threat of a r@@ umin@@ ous military who lives in poor growth and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , will consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt , &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and en@@ rol@@ ment , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were victims of a last symbolic act : the victims of a victim was buried in a terrain just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they might never go to justice , but at least they forget not their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with integrated head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire was held on Friday in one of the highest living rooms in the world in Dubai to run a bridge and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey buildings .
it is the second fir@@ ing that swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which you call acci@@ dentally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were no reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
we slept and we got up with the Fire alarm and during the cry of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor to come down , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais &apos;s civil protection authorities told that fighting units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hrs GMT ) cleared the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation for those concerned .
the incident can use questions concerning security of materials used in outer areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest portion of the damages from a covering , the out@@ lining of the lining or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police , she believes that the system of plates aff@@ ecting the isolation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ elle tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this was used for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two lines , but is not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but also therefore very estimated five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the traditional competitors .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for the reform , the target of IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member states haven &apos;t adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
we will continue to work on improving the applications .
not until the vote was before the proposal , after many claims before the proposal came to get the final in a neutral location .
new in 2018 will only be compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next year in the first round .
to reduce the costs of the organiz@@ ers , the requirements are made in training places , etc . and players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers to bring verb@@ ose objects to the aircraft , find out a pol@@ l
a survey conducted under air pass@@ codes showed that more than 20 percent of goods are s@@ wis@@ ely or un@@ aware of the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , such as at least 6 percent of which entered the aircraft , while they have acci@@ dentally forbidden knife or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent believed they had discovered that they were irrit@@ able with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey among more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a Jet Char@@ ter@@ Service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also established that younger trav@@ ellers are rather dis@@ regarded the rules .
of those survey@@ ed , they gave evidence that they have been trying to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , who were members of the generation X .
the most common items , which were deliber@@ ately prepared for T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent promp@@ ted to have certain items carried by security during security control , while 2.2 percent of women survey@@ ed and 3.7 percent of male respon@@ dents have also confirmed that they have taken inten@@ tionally f@@ aded drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it had question@@ ed travelers in the whole country in order to find out how many acci@@ d@@ gling s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware encouraged by the airport security and how many would have seen it inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who wear the he@@ avi@@ est s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or un@@ certain - due to safety , those who are most often flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain that liquids may take them away or how much of it .
therefore , it is no surprise that the largest amount of ordinary items of the T@@ SA are forbidden .
for a long time , the people thought the T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel stock
with the huge number of orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 , he is giving a huge number of pre @-@ orders .
so far , it has under@@ gone that some of the clients have with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has shown another , less gl@@ ac@@ ious number for the first time , with the announcement of the recent Quar@@ terly balance : cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had often advert@@ ised with the more than 500,000 orders for the new car in the past few months .
now Mus@@ k is coming : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 have already been with@@ drawn .
critics have always indicated that it is merely indic@@ ative for reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 U.S. dollar and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reserv@@ ation payment &quot; completely back .
currently 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ retail reservations before , divided Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation from date to date may be about twelve percent of all orders .
its own argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets does not lie in demand but on the production site .
last year Tesla created 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
all models are to be put together in 2018 - 500,000 being one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 free reservations are now available .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; from the second half of 2018 , should be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla manages to transfer his brand new , never in practice tested production lines with maximum load of load .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the integrity of the reservations should be Tesla &apos;s problems .
because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from entering in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chief Pru@@ v is moving back because of the re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant of the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after being accused of 15 states , Scott did Pru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority to delay his earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ induced air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
Pru@@ sion presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities with more respon@@ sive performance than previous administration .
he did not mention the complaint against his former place in a Federal Court of Appeal .
it is a time deadline , which started on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 o@@ zone close @-@ up o@@ zone .
Pru@@ itt announced in June that he will be hes@@ itation about a year to deal with his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; inter@@ fere in local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
Pru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponents of environmental protection regulations .
ever since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block or delay , which incorpor@@ ates the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
sudden revers@@ al from Wednesday is the latest review of the Pru@@ itts regulatory Roll@@ back Agenda .
last month , a Federal Labour Court in Washington ruled that the EPA Manager has exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pru@@ ten decided that his revers@@ al is at o@@ zone standard very simply to meet the will@@ ing@@ ness of EPA in cooperation with the United States through the complex process of del@@ aying the new standards .
&quot; in earlier administration , the EPA often has often kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited on the deadline for performing , and then agreed in an agreement with the deadline for performing tests , &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who def@@ endants EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation through judi@@ cial proceedings , and we take times seriously .
we also take the law and authority that gi@@ veth us seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that somehow materi@@ alized his &quot; reli@@ ance on the delay and all other legally available authority , &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information are based . &quot;
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive upgra@@ ding of the o@@ zone rules .
a legisl@@ ative draft approval of the rules of 2015 should be delayed by at least eight years in the last month of the draft law .
the measure was not set to vote in the Senate .
the New York @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Cut@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition to the United States in this week , said that the Group intends to maintain the statutory pressure .
&quot; the EPA of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans , which are directly po@@ unded by the smo@@ g , said Schneider .
new York closed in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , Minnes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone results in when poll@@ ut@@ ants coming from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight .
emerging smo@@ g can cause serious respir@@ atory problems , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases every year .
representatives of public health care and environmental prot@@ ru@@ ples of Pru@@ dence &apos;s surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tum@@ lingen covers 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius @-@ church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the church church , the old cemetery @-@ area will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 16.@@ 30 .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chant themselves from this powerful place .
the salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and supporters of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique little treasure . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Wu@@ er@@ ttemberg pri@@ ot book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z copied &quot; the hill with the inc@@ tive parish church to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark of silver .
the wording of the document was based on the rough mountain apart from the former parish church , but also a marv@@ ell@@ ous court , which belonged to the church or the patron right and not vice versa .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are now in the outskirts of Tum@@ lingen by now , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the magnificent sett@@ lements of the village .
old maps from time around the year 1600 probably under@@ estimate that historical events .
the patron is originated from the early medieval ap@@ t@@ itude .
a gent@@ leman who built up a church and occupied with a pastor , continued to be owner of this church .
thereby , the right to deplo@@ y a pastor or the bishop to present a new pastor .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones were celebrated at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly introduced bell was the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were st@@ aked and the bel@@ lows were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aky .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius were also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwe@@ iler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the church tower had been left .
in the New Year &apos;s year 18@@ 34 , a storm formed the ste@@ ep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was cancel@@ ed .
only the tower existing today has remained as a witness of the 750 years @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ allen@@ ger of the &quot; Schaff@@ ner reti@@ res &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant .
as organiz@@ ers invite the friends and supporters of tum@@ our on Sunday , July 16th , the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade onto the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is made by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ te@@ is .
the village of Hartmut Roman@@ ann is speaking the pre@@ face .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
intake is from 15.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
for the passage of the Ser@@ en@@ ade there is a trunk of the cemetery instead of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening below the shade of old trees and with wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; the organiz@@ ers put out fantastic views .
the ser@@ en@@ ade will only take place in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope to support many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ult and audit@@ ors .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home maintain , like Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organiz@@ ers Walter Mart@@ ini .
Verein intends to check the approval of wind@@ breaks
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim continues &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and is directed toward the coun@@ cils .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has promp@@ ted &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to take back its author@@ ization for the construction of planned wind turbines in the floor area N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association is argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been authorised , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , a wind force concentration camp existed only at the time in Vier@@ sen at the time in Vier@@ sen .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines is possible , at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the town .
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier , the town had already decided to change the vial action plan for a second wind turbine zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it had not been approved by the Düsseldorf District Court because of its form@@ ers .
&quot; the applicant &apos;s lack of approval is due to the lack of approval of approval from the lack of planned regulatory appro@@ vals , &quot; said Christopher Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council has decided before the summer break once again the wind con@@ cent@@ ering zone in the area of Bo@@ is@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a author@@ ization of the district government is still standing .
kens : &quot; this is the foundation of obtaining permission for the creation of wind energy plants according to plan . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writings have been made in the circle for last week , &quot; explained a spokes@@ man .
the circle makes it a reason to try again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with a view of ongoing trial at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express itself on the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four of the 200 metres high on an area on the floor area N@@ ette N@@ ette .
already last year , the company in which the city has been involved in the middle of the district , P@@ acht@@ as with the owner of the approximately 65 acres large ground area closed .
with the establishment of four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered from roughly 11 400 households , which equ@@ ates to roughly one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ se@@ ers households .
the NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens City entered the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ berg district .

town and dealers plan &quot; Home shopping &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ s@@ ers and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal authorities will take advantage of the weekend of July 8 and 9 , to attract the inhabitants for shopping in downtown .
as the chairman of the business relationship , Christian König , said the &apos; homeland @-@ shopping &apos; weekend to sens@@ it@@ ise the clients , which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ merchan@@ dise .
it is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
native companies should also present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the inner city centre will invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the action is not just the inhabitants of the city and the local area .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , a internet video and printed bags , point to the action weekend , says Christian King .
the municipal authorities and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
to this end the business society and the city go into a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
this includes new deals such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the well @-@ held Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to move them for active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the zi@@ pper on parking fees that day are part of the concept .
customer potential will also be re@@ constructed or explored .
these include short groups and tourists .
but many locals also lost the inner city downtown shopping .
at the end everybody should contribute to anim@@ ate the inner city - to rent , to the factories all around the city and clubs .
she sailed with a network to overcome the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y that had somewhat wider , King had said in the spring .

according to a sealed tran@@ scription of telephone call , Tr@@ ump placed Mexico under pressure because of paying the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ ading of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump in a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , to openly say that he would not pay for a planned budget .
the U.S. president dict@@ ated him , because he had den@@ ounced the wall openly . he said to him : &quot; they cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Bull was also published and revealed a cl@@ amped exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ Bull said that a trading for the United States is to take over &quot; ri@@ di@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; proposed by the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the USA .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said ab Turn@@ Bull , &quot; that is the most un@@ pleasant call for all day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford &apos;s Ford massacre - activists lead to rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice to again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury launched a group of viewers in the rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ inks to the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block his way .
the leader of the bul@@ lying - a man middle age in a con@@ if@@ ers - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar and looking at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants the in@@ mates are in fear .
&quot; we want to know this n -@@ --- r Roger ! . &quot; they ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams torn the silence , as a young black man was crushed by the passenger .
thank@@ fully , this horri@@ ble scene was played on the 22nd of July , just a post@@ ure .
but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost everyone in the audience is really real si@@ gh .
since 2005 , Citi@@ zenship went back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge in order to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Doro@@ thy Mal@@ com - from the K@@ u Club@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indicted for murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it &apos;s a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress Council from Georgia and a life everlasting .
for him , post@@ ure as a dramatic call for action acts as a dramatic call to the Mon@@ roe community that an in@@ justice system has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to follow the prosecution , we want to heal , we want to reconc@@ ile , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot get into healing and recon@@ ciliation until we get justice . &quot;
a court physician places a blanket on the dead body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding villages were suspected of fac@@ ades .
but nobody ever was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on loose feet for decades , Citi@@ zenship say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision made by the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in their vote in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ony according to the FB@@ I , the black bull suite Roger Mal@@ com moved on a white ground owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ os@@ edly about a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that sm@@ ells in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Doro@@ thy and that the baby was not wearing her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent , white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Doro@@ thy and their cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when they came away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ran the car around .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who has prepared and arranged the k@@ illings , &quot; conclu@@ des the FB@@ I report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it form@@ ative .
&quot; it was a const@@ itu@@ ary massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; when you vote and when you vote , you will pass this here . &quot;
during a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has guided the yearly reference to Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is illustr@@ ative , stra@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many believe that he doesn &apos;t exist in America anymore .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with the u@@ a@@ que@@ ous in us all , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship to you if you don &apos;t want to listen to or hear what I am through . &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors were pressed - a dozen whit@@ eness and the rest , when Gre@@ ene started a good overview over the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ it Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ re since years , but he says it never becomes easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story of life because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot;
on the other hand of the room , actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , who scre@@ ams the tester and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Doro@@ thy .
&quot; I said , n . -- he , w@@ aved away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona sh@@ akes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody leaves ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene Lau@@ ghter at the lou@@ dest point .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene &quot; said still k@@ ich@@ ever .
&quot; I simply don &apos;t believe that white people would have said &apos; n &apos; n &apos; .
&quot; yet , &quot; swe@@ ating one of the other black perform@@ ers .
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely there is the energy in the room , a feeling of com@@ rades replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy preparing to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed persons .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition is violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a wedding dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads to Che@@ ster Holidays Trau@@ matic Lob@@ o &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters . a group of about four dozen people f@@ ading away sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many are just getting down the street .
they have experienced all nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Broo@@ ks put them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of mal@@ com@@ s and dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you find on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air is sp@@ oo@@ ky .
if the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to insp@@ ect the dead body .
children squ@@ at their heads , sign the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and quiet bodies and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not real dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy than to remember .
after a few minutes , gre@@ ens thanks to the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw turns her Mar@@ ic@@ gh , a man in his suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ der .
Nick Ras@@ cona surro@@ unds two of his fellow players and then breaks up weeping in her arms , the emotional moment of performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did it for a reason . &quot;
later the audience deals with actors at dinner .

&quot; it is difficult to hear these horri@@ ble words and deeds ... coming from people who like yourself and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the post@@ ure is inspiring , as she describes the hor@@ rors of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so if we do not learn from it , then it can happen again .

I draw a positive conclusion .
Max volume works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteers an equal to several places .
where anywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at the school in open whole day .
how are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with juven@@ iles , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so a late volunteer .
how does it come ?
quantity : I graduated from S@@ LC .
and then a civil engineering studies , let &apos;s say again , successfully cancel@@ ed .
for me , I knew it is wrong for me and I want to make something different for me to work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there &apos;s a glimp@@ se of there , there you can see , as it is on location , in focal point maybe even , really is .
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my study in the social work semester in winter semester .
I will be a student of social workers at the university in Ju@@ di@@ dam@@ n , studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different uses during the volunte@@ ering service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it seems always to be where you make his FS@@ J .
you can do it from al@@ ms to youth work - in all sorts of facets of the social work .
for me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , it was just the right thing for me to get irrit@@ ated .
I could realise my own strengths and see how it is going on .
other than in Civil Engineering ?
quantity : well , it &apos;s not about to offset stress .
you always have other people head , each behind which have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , a teen@@ ager has been caught up from the family - you must always have to go out individually .
very interesting .
and they had no touch of contact ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life .
Pear@@ son short@@ ens further 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , since another restructuring programme is started to overcome the pressure that the company was confronted with .
in addition to its previous restructuring , the Director General John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , has already been lost 4,000 jobs .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost programme , a plan aimed at cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by a quick step toward digital learning .
the company , who sold his shar@@ ehol@@ ding in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year remains unchanged , after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy Attack by Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ bed was attacked by a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kabul , killed by soldiers and inj@@ uring several others .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were viol@@ ated , a NATO statement commented .
according to local reports , according to the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district , three civilians were killed .
the bombing is the last act of violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bed killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it states that all injured in a stable condition and are treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the increasing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian victims , of which 20 % were in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car of at least 30 people killed at least 30 people in the Kabul district of Kabul .
the Taliban said , they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ b@@ ation in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the deadly mil@@ it@@ ant attack of the country , since the US guided troops in 2001 displac@@ ed the power .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to increase the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul have caused a crisis of public confidence in Kabul , the government , their policy , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani .
EPA is deci@@ ding to delay the smo@@ g rule after complaints to delay
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a decision to adjust the government of Obama to delay that which states are oblig@@ ated to em@@ bed the smo@@ g @-@ created emissions . this was a day after 15 states committed the agency because of the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced its decision on Wednesday to advance the &quot; o@@ zone regulations &quot; in 2015 , and said it will show the obligation of the agency to work with states .
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA leader Scott got in a declaration .
Pru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to establish the o@@ zone rules - in which part of the country should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions , in order to establish a stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 most democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to impos@@ e a broad range of environmental issues that the former president Barack Obama has imposed on a wider agenda , which should stim@@ ulate economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EP@@ O website says that the inclusion of air , the o@@ zone includes &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen the respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
community wants a common room
in the end , the decision was clear : upon two votes , the municipal council of flu@@ ke @-@ win@@ ism conclu@@ des the establishment of a common room in the future cancer clinic .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining base part has been signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas .
although it will still take before the church community belonged to the parish of parish , yet there is no planning for the project to become a public investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would provide area of approximately 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with some 70 square metres of space is available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the council ul@@ ges , such a common room is not just as a meeting place for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ @-@ just living room , but open to the community .
as an example , the word of the &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made a lap .
the decision by providing funding for the current budget has already been decided in the last autumn by means of funding options .
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a shared room would be , as reported t@@ j@@ adas , with 60 percent by 30 percent eligible .
the decision of the decision to signal the investor is to show that there is no b@@ ill@@ ets down between the legs in this regard - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what makes the tr@@ ump @-@ height and construction of more economic power - which would be possible .
need@@ less , so do not mean Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously the body will happen .
not as easy as it is in the common room .
Daniela reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which you don &apos;t come along so well , you can now feel the common room out of the window , says : &quot; I am very heavy with that . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is essential for the common room , but absolutely for a municipal participation .
she sees behind a conc@@ e@@ aled maximinum payout of wealth or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of an area you don &apos;t give a supplement but I get a real , in doubt that counter@@ acts , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s application , decision on the decision , finds three adv@@ o@@ cates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the resin of Stern to immig@@ rate
the nation@@ wide &quot; star path &quot; is set to emerge in the Harz Mountains .
this is the sign of the association Ob@@ servatory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; from the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ ou@@ cher meet , was the name of it .
he connect nature , science , movement , and sporting performance .
the members want to set up the scheduled route and get information on stars and stars .
in the first phase until 2018 the association is planning &quot; well att@@ ain@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quire of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , brown situation , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards will be supple@@ mented by Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception is played at the location selection .
acc@@ essibility may also be a crit@@ er@@ ion .
the star train line will be extended by train later .
&quot; on the star path , the viewer learned a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although it is considerably removed .
also , in which constellation can I find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , at the highest nearby ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Natural Protection , the Harz National Park is one of the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
from there often the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy were clearly seen from the naked eye .
since 2003 , in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there is something similar to the Planet@@ arium Göttingen initiative since 2003 as the planned star@@ ship - the planet route .
starting from Geb@@ h@@ ard Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to Hain@@ berg and to the ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ at@@ erre@@ stri@@ al &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ ahs ( Municip@@ ality ) with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ running Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth is shr@@ unk to a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun measures about 70 cm away , while the sun measures 70 cm .
the entire distance from the planet will be four kilometers .
while the light is needed from sun to the Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed would take another half year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia who are in a coll@@ ision course to produce the most exciting competition in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Boxing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organisation Super @-@ key champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ zes on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How are you , champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 : 00 p.m .
when the pair of p@@ lowed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Cli@@ ma noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect mag@@ n@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so great .
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to run down any light weight .
and he must move to lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand that .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted to vote .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate dev@@ ote whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must be strug@@ gling with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also had an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight title combat in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pulled out later on the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , he reck@@ on Lom@@ ach@@ enko as a &quot; massive fighter . &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side look very slowly , sorry about Mik@@ ey ... you always wanted to co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show stroke strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum which was up for their own struggle .
&quot; this is the battle that must be done .
no other struggle creates so much awareness and enthusiasm .
I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko : &quot; I waited for the top fighter , and this is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Last After T@@ ire Plat@@ zer
four people were injured during an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost shortly before the end of the market , presumably in front of a tire plat@@ ter , after a tyre barrier control .
the car drove straight into the arch , where he over@@ threw himself , and then remained on the roof in the gr@@ ate .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured service , A7 toward the north for about an hour was locked , then traffic could be settled on the left side of the accident at the accident site .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 start of the season open@@ er in Braunschweig for the optim@@ isation of the defense information in Au@@ e points .
with the first season finale Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result , since then there weren &apos;t the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Brun@@ swi@@ ck .
&quot; we were two opponents to a lot , and we have to watch out more in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge the triple chain is also further optimised .
and a gate after a free shoot , the bar@@ ns also don &apos;t want to catch .
&quot; for the future it will be so that no one is standing next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team has better rig@@ ging even after the experience in preparation with the spin chain better than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; still don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure to have that right in the triple chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but , that we harmon@@ ise better and don &apos;t afford such many mistakes in the building . &quot;
of course Hoffmann is also travelling to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; but if you cannot speak after a deci@@ du@@ ous start , I don &apos;t know .
the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly speak of a good season open@@ er . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; the start into the season I drove only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el who doesn &apos;t want to speak from an advantage over to Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a wet@@ ter .
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even have something fresh as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una to get a rise in the bone as Fort@@ una .
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defender of the Fort@@ una .

new results of the Swedish asylum application testing are published
the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( ri@@ pt@@ ile in@@ tran@@ ket ) has started with the performance of tests last year .
they should make the estim@@ ation of age more accurate during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Mig@@ r@@ ational Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ dep@@ ket ) has been critic@@ ised by several refugees in jud@@ ging the correct age of some refugees .
up to now , Mig@@ r@@ ational Medi@@ ket 6.@@ 880 has been sent to test@@ ifying cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 testing from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) was judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency shared that the person was &quot; probably 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , results are stable during the past months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged more than 18 years does not mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the submission person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det out the 5@@ 81 results found that in 243 of these cases the person had been openly told that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical demen@@ tia assessment , used in X @-@ rays of disease teeth and MRI photos of knee @-@ joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was critic@@ ized also in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is@@ ist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Instit@@ utes , whose work is the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether it so@@ oner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that kind of measuring should be used .
to judge the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot tell it sure we should not do it as if we could say , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson , of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk of taking a child as an adult is poor .
the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing along well .
a seven tons of heavy emphasis was installed at the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time it runs super , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the department of road@@ works and traffic in the government of Freiburg .
in April , work began simultaneously on all three @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is provided for October and is easy to keep track of the schedule .
the first bridge coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg runs through the mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is lined with red colored cotton and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and transport reliability , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red coloured vessels .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,@@ 30 metre wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning .
this is a margin , which is also used as operating away .
a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge can be used on the southern part of the bridge .
the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way should then go .
the particular thing is that it is finished with manufacturing parts , a patent in the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ print feeling has the laying of lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a glass cable , where many companies are connected .
local residents were informed prior to work by hand@@ ler on the project .
fish and can@@ cers initially had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building of the building and the collective pasture in direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is connected with a traffic light .
for construction on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ restri@@ al town centre , the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; are fully blocked .
the cost of the three breasts amount to 700 000 Euro .
this is financed by the land .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest at protest at German potato sal@@ at
it does not happen very often that parties go along a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring with a hat .
the parties in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcan@@ os represent parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG ) , belonging to a wide alliance , which is peaceful on this day , because the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell goes back to a poster for a great campaign of choice .
and well known names in the start@@ up - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land will be the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the AF@@ D errors , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city picnic was scheduled under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but will take place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and directly in front of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A World and one of the relevant organiz@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people come together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; ancient potato sal@@ ce , which could easily eat the AF@@ D , &quot; says the woman whom brought him .
police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , but it shows presence above all also at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the AF@@ D volcanic cones , he tried to arrange an event and got the supplement .
at first in Dau@@ n , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was at first found in Dau@@ n , but there was no Canc@@ ell@@ ation because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us church not enough parking places available .
so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ eland is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
looking at the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also works : at 20 o &apos;clock in the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , near the town hall , several speakers , including the rh@@ etor@@ ic @-@ der@@ el@@ ic AF@@ D @-@ Chair@@ men Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners that wait for the Bundestag for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ acting president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence , but so far , the officers had a peaceful evening .
something more than one hour the AF@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the fore@@ court have a longer breath , but even there it will be announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can press back - no special inci@@ dents .
trombone meets trumpet
a return with the Wolf Pos@@ aun@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a series of Has@@ l@@ acher &apos;s mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; has a classic German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winner and winner of numerous international competitions , and have set solo positions in European plants .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is performed by the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo recording of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
they both unite the lust , not only the boundaries of their instruments , but mer@@ ging the borders of the different gen@@ res .
like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ &apos;s &quot; World Music &quot; sounds like in a new style , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ &apos;s &quot; World Music &quot; combined with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jaz@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ rus N@@ ils W@@ IMA , combine classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating total work of art .
this core of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ IMA has written specifically for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ church with her special acou@@ st@@ ics is consci@@ ously taken into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled che@@ eses and they will eat him until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart is openly about their bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
&quot; when I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh , that &apos;s cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood stars became the twi@@ light &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who eventually left bitter .
despite all of that the brunette student was covered with the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with any seriously injured , whom I hated .
or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation he said that they are bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
I have never really liked to be taken seriously . &quot;
she especially suffered , according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz , &quot; but in school times they prefer to be like a Bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
it really hurt me very much .
when I had eleven , my children said to me , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and sh@@ amed .
now look back , and I think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they do not love their love of love : &quot; people expect you to be relatively a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps I call me some as und@@ et@@ ectable , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify the whole public . &quot;
Virginia Governor of West Virginia Announ@@ ces He changes the Party
. the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced the Thursday evening on a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the demo@@ cra@@ t have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you of many prayers and say much re@@ minded ... today I will tell you more than inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I &apos;m a democratic polit@@ ician . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won the West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
justice , the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the country , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes revealed that he possesses coal mines in five states , and from his father inherited a carbon business .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee set up a statement on Thursday evening . in which it said , &quot; the Party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , who would rather hin@@ der than work to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ance and the control of the least legisl@@ ative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is not yet able to find a positive , pur@@ ified message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel , in a statement about the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E lo@@ oses &quot; honest &quot; Russian debt for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world head of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as apparent ap@@ ology from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it was not the moment to be included in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress at the eve of Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , that the exile of his country was correct , and that he was determined to fight the D@@ oping .
he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes who were caught up in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the Rep@@ orters .
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased that the Russian Federation had experienced by itself that they have experienced some pretty hot times , and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ launching .
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think progress was made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to dis@@ connect the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
the n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes are starting at the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships starting on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , Rune Ander@@ sen , said on Monday to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setup .
threats are still incomplete and forbidden trainer are still free , he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .

the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
for the still un@@ solved crash , Minister of Defence said Ursula of the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) .
but they described the other inver@@ ted drivers as &quot; experienced professionals . &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they showed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; declared them .

also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , the commander of the Regim@@ ent , to whom the soldiers are belonging , said : &quot; if this occupation could not abol@@ ish the crash , nobody would have liked him . &quot;
if there was no doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen was not going to be the case .
but he is of high importance &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said .
after the fun@@ eral a coff@@ in was brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not make any information .

I was different .
I seemed happy to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
those were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a new choice
CDU and F@@ DP in front of a great majority in Lower Saxony
Mr. Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to withdraw .
and on Friday , the Parliament resolution was made up .
earlier , the surprising iting of a Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony had donated the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the @-@ time @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its top @-@ votes majority in parliament at the CDU and F@@ DP parliamentary elections .
the previous Green Dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests set up their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 World Election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; declared it on Friday in Hanover .
Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to the Group .
thus CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the lower Sax@@ on parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was the reverse .
the new parliament is chosen on 14 January in the coming year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government had to decide whether they could continue to gover@@ n in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , believes that the parliament pursu@@ es its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through their further procedure .
the state version also sees the possibility that the Parliament is reli@@ eved for the prime minister and choosing a successor .
&quot; our constitution provides several options .
these opportunities must be legally checked , &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said .
&quot; you will discuss all your questions in peace , if they are legal r@@ ational . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the T@@ ern@@ berg step &quot; but something is cur@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
the politicians itself emphas@@ ized : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called himself as a scri@@ be of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the subsi@@ dy MPs for the return of their land status .
&quot; we anticip@@ ate that she has received its landing stage which she received over the green country of the country , with immediate effect , &quot; distributed the president met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
S &amp; D Group president Anja PI@@ EL said : &quot; we regret the decision of the El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests &apos; decision .
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; also in the background that there was no illegal differences , we cannot sub@@ merge this step . &quot;
SPD law candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the state of parliament for the CDU as a parliament for the CDU as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Dep@@ u@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ y@@ al of the v@@ oters of the v@@ oters , but also betra@@ y@@ al of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the Federal Government of Socialists on Friday to Facebook .
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , making the Parliament fast ane@@ w .
the exit of SWA is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony &apos;s majority .
the politicians in their last E@@ it@@ el@@ iness and in her Fr@@ ust their personal interests in the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ized SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony em@@ powers this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ y and tries to capit@@ alize into political capital . &quot;
T@@ int@@ ec@@ sens@@ us CDU @-@ Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members to the CDU in the CDU .
the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , signed T@@ v@@ ests to for@@ f@@ ake the results of the regional election cycle in 2013 .
the CDU was then strongest in front of the SPD , but the SPD and Green had a very thin majority in the Parliament .
County of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect us from Gif@@ ts , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses the contam@@ inated eggs .
how did the sc@@ andal have to happen ?
how can consumers defend themselves .
agriculture minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) interview with the German Editor ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How does the consumer protect against pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can encourage only all consumer inside and consumers , to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check stamp at the stamp .
the Bundes@@ länder will present the respective information on the bat@@ ches @-@ bat@@ ches on consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ w@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if everything we currently know , health haz@@ ard is virtually excluded .
now Al@@ di succe@@ eds in the best possible crisis re@@ jection - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture .
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
nevertheless , my house has immediately changed and is located since announcement of Germany &apos;s dism@@ ay in close exchange with the authorities of the Länder .
all information and risk assessment are call@@ able for the consumer .
the trade , similarly , is the manufacturer concerned to ensure that the sold products are safe and harmless .
if with eggs of the resi@@ due @-@ level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time our establ@@ ishments are not to blame .
do production companies and consumers work in the same boat ?
the production companies do not meet immediate gu@@ ilt according to the constra@@ int knowledge .
rather , due to the alleged illegal practices of service firms , they must be reck@@ oned with economic damages .
as always , there is too little control in harvest .
is it missing only on personnel or also in the conclu@@ sive back@@ war@@ dness ?
only the official controls were un@@ covered , which un@@ covered the process .
but for truth , food in@@ solven@@ cy and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
just as such , a consistent recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of such events and the hand@@ over to the office in the cases in which off@@ ences can occur , of decisive significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food scales ?
the consumers and consumers have the right to obtain certain safe and market@@ able foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in food industry , consumers are right up to consumers .
by ar@@ mo@@ red means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers were able to get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
it must basically be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ deli@@ il is not acceptable in the attitude of food @-@ safe animals and must be immediately terminated .
we must consistently and work with high pressure on all levels .
I &apos;m expecting from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is fully resolved .
how the financial rules of the football on Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football matches will not inter@@ fere with Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain , because the guiding organisation , which has super@@ vised the European game , has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were created in 2011 by the UEFA Champions League , mean that PS@@ G has to point out at some point that the transfer of Ne@@ y@@ mar has been financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars move to France .
PS@@ G can easily make the money loose , that Ne@@ y@@ mar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team through the energy rich ruling family of Qatar .
users may waste a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must act with legitim@@ ate entry of income that will allow them the break @-@ even point in their football related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini in 2007 following his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player thought that Ver@@ eine that had enormous debts in their quest for success had to be effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked , when banks or owners have with@@ drawn their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P was attri@@ but@@ able to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Ab@@ ram@@ ov@@ ich , originally bought in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter .
clubs in the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Presi@@ dency of the Un@@ gn@@ ade in 2015 , his UEFA @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to put off in excess expenses .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will step up the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Hor@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associated Press in the past week .
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ y@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , allowing the sales revenue for the next five years amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 is the PS@@ G , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
PS@@ G got a fine of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later dropped to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to soli@@ di@@ fy their financial markets by combining their money by companies that are linked to owners of a clubs .
while a Catalan company could be responsible for PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsor should exceed the default value , the UEFA does not apply this as a legitim@@ ate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA chose that the value of the sponsors of the Qatar was held by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ y@@ mar will be published by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have acknowledged that Ne@@ y@@ mar WM @-@ amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be an effort to find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regulator .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA is still attentive to ad@@ mit each attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars . on Thursday , the people advised him to become familiar with the situation .
they said in the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not fu@@ elled to discuss PS@@ G situation .
the recent reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million in 2015 with a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars arrival a blessing for Sponsor@@ ship De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot kern@@ els .
the association expects sales to rise at least 30 percent after signing the signature .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and they tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars away from killing that PS@@ G would harm the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financed d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the country , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS reference to Kat@@ ars the business owner on PS@@ G .
ar@@ sen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose society is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservation of La League against a State who financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new area of equipment
in the past years he made cho@@ col@@ at fre@@ y board chocolate for Swiss .
now the whole cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline requires the order .
Swiss @-@ speaking in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p was confirmed on request of the &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; news agency on request .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract during the first half of 2018 .
the products would check for two to three years and are subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
around 17 million small rotary @-@ white pack@@ ets of 14 grams are distributed each year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss does not want to pay any information about the cost .
industry interests assess the order volume according to &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of roughly one billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly the advertising effect : it is a highly prestigious order for a scra@@ per producer .
as many applicants are in the new call , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y .
but in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to upgrade the Treaty by 2018 .
for the S@@ DA the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not att@@ ain@@ able for a statement .
chocolate bars are distributed by Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before leaving Swiss a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss made two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ h@@ aul flights the customers of First Class with delic@@ ac@@ ies are spoiled by the conf@@ is@@ eries Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class n@@ aschen Spot S@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
at the short distance Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and in Economy Class .

nost@@ al@@ gic continues in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of the 80 @-@ yrs era ( as the visionary David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era .
but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like time .
first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
in speaking at the nu@@ cle@@ us of the g@@ ag - actor middle age play @-@ aged children who grow up - nevertheless they managed to recover the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the calf .
&quot; Ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotional rooted and its par@@ ody is more than the wat@@ ering rule , including a reef onto the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which sees the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
on one point , a character bran@@ ched through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Rom@@ aut@@ or , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) still .

and there is another mad @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant Plot , included in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ illon &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ board of &quot; sin@@ gles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is going to feel like an old cra@@ cker .

blow against Drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the Country
the police managed to blow a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstan@@ z , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects are searched by the public pro@@ secutor in Konstan@@ z , on Friday .
in the age of 25 and 77 years , 15 accused were arrested and sentenced to them by arrest warran@@ ts .
moreover , officials reported large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros for sure .
at the same raid in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects , there was German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany presumably .
an Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the m@@ af@@ ia members organised drugs criminal , severe violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and gas@@ ket .
the public pro@@ secutor &apos;s public pro@@ secutor has been calcul@@ ating public drug traff@@ icking in southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the district centres in Konstan@@ z , Germany , there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the major insert on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the visor of the investigations , Italian nationals combined with the Italian m@@ af@@ ia had respect to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ started , in which several shots were fired at a venue in the early morning , is likely to go to the account of the ban@@ de .
fashion test@@ i@@ fies large g@@ aps in the fore@@ ig@@ ner tab
&quot; data from citizens that do not show up here &quot; : a report says the fore@@ ig@@ ner register in Germany significantly short@@ com@@ ings .
this lead to some serious mal@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Way , has drawn attention to a media report according to large g@@ aps in the foreign commercial register .
defects during the registered data could lead to some serious false errors in asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations &quot; in an analysis which occurred in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; .
according to the regist@@ ers , a total of 10 million people with foreign nationality are contained , including 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality has not been well maintained until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; incorrect processes can be slow down processes , &quot; says the report on .
in the statistics concerning travel @-@ sensitive people , this EU citizens are recorded , who would not have to travel anymore .
but such false assign@@ ments resulted in an arbit@@ r@@ ary debate about the use of a trav@@ eller @-@ f@@ lich@@ y , i.e. it is therefore in the analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government apparently began to return to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they came to Italy .
this is derived from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , writes the &quot; New Test@@ ers newspaper . &quot;
the paper thus means that BAM@@ F conduct such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 through . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer possible , the newspaper was on the difficult situation in reference to the difficult situation .
following the Dublin Treaty , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach it first .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immig@@ ration .
reas@@ oning to the reas@@ oning : &quot; in the meantime , the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
I have given the interest in Italy for the recording and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) was adequate for these promises .
also other EU countries would send refugees back to there in the Dublin region .
the domestic policy spokes@@ woman in the German parliament , U@@ lla Yel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children threatened by lack of im@@ itation in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a companion of childhood . &quot;
second best results achieved
the blood don@@ or service has already been available for other people in the capacity of 220 liters of blood .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded the Friday .
above all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his meanwhile 100 donations has now distributed fifty litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation in the session of the council to disp@@ ense multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps a number of people , &quot; explained by the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their components .
so you could benefit three people from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn makers were reported by the actions taken in the spring in the spring .
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 divisions , &quot; said the DR@@ K district .
obviously , the change to the theatre house has resulted in increased numbers of numbers a few years ago .
in the present Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta has been awarded for 50 % of the delivered blood donations .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates by 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have d@@ amped the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; will remain in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure in the middle of a intensi@@ fying print .
in this month , the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to ensure the interest rates of 0.@@ 25 % , in this month less members reach a rise , because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly effect for 2017 , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and expected that the pressure in the household income would continue to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but they sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest @-@ caves were needed to stim@@ ulate the inflation of the Bre@@ xit and told that the loan would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package that was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it is demanding time for the financing plan to provide cheap funding for banks since the coming February , although it is expected that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - at 115 billion sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in short term , because pressure on the real@@ ities will continue to load the consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets currently fore@@ see the first increase in the third quarter of the year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; step &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would occur .
following the growth progn@@ osis of the Bank for this and next year , the Bank forecast for this and next year is 1.9 % and 1,7 % forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages across the dollar and the Euro .
the pounds fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change is due after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have reduced the increasing expectations of an interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is expected to easily recover from the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increasing inflation and slight che@@ ering cavity , as the waste will first become worse before it becomes better .
she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated by a proportion of lower consumer spending .
the decision will take one year after the lower@@ ing of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote caused the lower@@ ing of the p@@ fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank on the rate of interest rates , the call was increased after an interest rate , since inflation was increased to hard labour , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July having demanded an increase of 0.5 % .
in the past month of 2.9 % , inflation was dropped to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected to be put on in the coming months .
the bank said , the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % may be &quot; completely &quot; to watch the weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ verd@@ ant , director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent review of the swap rate , the mort@@ gage market should again be competitive again , as the credit cards are looking for many shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks very well for those who finish the existing De@@ als and finish the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low inst@@ al@@ ments are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should en@@ force 10,000 people on controversial HIV drug
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform &quot; HIV pre@@ ven@@ tional treatment &quot; in front of a high court in front of the high court in order to finance the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the sexual intercourse proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in risk @-@ risk factors by about 86 percent , now comes from the health service over a first three @-@ year study to estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court in which the N@@ HS had assumed that the Pr@@ EP was able to pay the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him .
announced on Thursday , N@@ HS England Chief Simon Stev@@ ens announced as &quot; major new intervention &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) , which referred to as &quot; crucial moment . &quot;
sexual health related clinics in London , Bri@@ ghton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first to make registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced to England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ference processes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before having sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces the HIV transmission for infections risk .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come for the treatment of being are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not successful .
in clinics , suitable participants will identify the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals that have a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local sex hospital .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the medication this week following an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study aims to assess the overall potential of Pr@@ EP compar@@ ing clinical evidence as it is used in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far reaching and increasingly successful efforts to keep HIV and over@@ take .
it is a further milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive with NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is crucial in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if specifically aimed at needy and vulner@@ able people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September on , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England will have to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many many lives .
we warmly welcome these announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , president of Ter@@ rence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie on the whole country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV .
now since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ o was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Hodg@@ son , Sh@@ adows of Health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due after months of dist@@ or@@ tions and re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant implementation .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection can end .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the Great Life : mezz@@ anine and smart designer tricks have converted this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a real passion for real estate , smaller 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it lies on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been fully over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a sealed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne Stau@@ ber and a mezz@@ anine to optimal use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she assigned the Design Studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to make the 12.5 foot raised high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to life for yo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which you could stand .
you had to think creative to solve the task .
&quot; the steel works is rather complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange rooms so arranged that they were stacked over each other , without leaving us .
it was not only about building a simple platform , but put the steel so that it had for the function up or down the right height . &quot;
it paved the way for it to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezz@@ anine a classic copper window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make it longer possible .
in the kitchen the reflection of the window will feel like a window in another room .
at the entrance are mir@@ ro@@ red units square for all bur@@ ners and glasses of jo@@ g .
by perception of a glam@@ orous cat@@ er@@ oom , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when she is not used .
foldable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit engineering accompl@@ ishment went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of steel reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ ated MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it &apos;s mutual , so it &apos;s when you push the door , very easy gli@@ de . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage , it could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is estimated , &quot; Er@@ a says .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they managed to increase the floor space and to use high quality materials , which provide the room its luxurious benefits .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that , therefore , help create an emotional connection to a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ ering of something standard into something completely .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million in real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dy@@ nasty , in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate companies Victoria &apos;s worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul , who has brought him to the Supreme Court to adopt the property , property and assets .
Paul did not want to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confron@@ tation with the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mom Anna , brothers 38 have accumulated in the value of more than half a billion dollars , and since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co je@@ ans family established there and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold to USD 85 million in 1999 .
the money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bull and shopping centers in the subur@@ b .
following an agreement with her dec@@ eased , Colin - by Paul , as a &quot; principal driver and the dominant personality , &quot; is described in the De Lut@@ is family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul about a third .
a place of jurisdiction proves that Colin owns the value of $ 316 million and it has valued at $ 176 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the Colin suggested articles have left him with him , which I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in the first ape in 2015 .
last Friday , after several failed attempts , the first Court of Justice took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control over existing business - including Colin , how Paul claims to have been excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but Paul introduces Paul to manage some poss@@ essions .
in an early mor@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Colin , he says he hop@@ ed to settle the argument .
&quot; my Italian heritage declar@@ es that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with monkey items , emails and charter companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held bonds .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and del@@ ik@@ at@@ ess@@ ments from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck .
you used the security to purchase the Coll@@ ing@@ wood personality , in Colin the first je@@ ans shop opened the family .
Colin says that he started doing there , when he became &quot; High School &quot; in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , wanted to disc@@ lose their property to her sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land on trial , &quot; she wrote .
two other Brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lut@@ is group , Colin claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million in leaving the company $ 10 million and Luke 26 million .
both Luke and Mark are , says Paul &quot; has bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept very backward , although a former AF@@ L board member was and following a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media received in touch with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and her lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the dishes .
&quot; it &apos;s very sad that my brother Paul chose to acc@@ use me and draw our family name by the courts &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father did not want Paul and I would end in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our business will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ ump of new staff is planning to limit the media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Polit@@ ico partner reports that the new staff of staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on an even course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , who met new staff of the White House , at his first working day with executive employee , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wants to repair : bad information that into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information about him should - whether on paper or in writing - because the President would make better decisions if he would obtain good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ oss tr@@ ump by over@@ seeing its media .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades now - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV shows are still strong .
&quot; if a candidate was anno@@ yed because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were persu@@ aded , &quot; said the former campaign advisor to Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter hab@@ it is in control , according to six former campaign officers in it , ensuring that his personal media consumption involves a constant lob@@ ster . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter @-@ hab@@ it ever &quot; was under control , &quot; is ri@@ di@@ culous .
maybe this battle makers know something that we don &apos;t know that tr@@ umps Twe@@ et would have been included without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets , which Tr@@ ump does not send .
if his employees have managed to keep away from him a few times , their efforts have paid off .
but no one has system@@ atically mis@@ er@@ adi@@ c@@ ate that tr@@ ump contro@@ le is stro@@ kes .
a part of the problem exists that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material that may help their views of the world .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO : quite busy with this history - reported in May on the pre@@ ference of consult@@ ants , president of strategic reasons for du@@ bi@@ ous information .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump as a volcano can react to negative press sections , especially such with damaged le@@ aks , and that he st@@ iff to find out where these come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Johnson was banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he had no concrete evidence , or that he expressed false alle@@ g@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly was trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove themselves as a pri@@ eb@@ us manager , but tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and its coun@@ sel@@ ors are still looking for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
demanding cr@@ ush@@ ers get mail from Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population is hop@@ ed and hop@@ ed .
the Police in all of Europe are ma@@ iled in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on a dangerous criminal .
since the addresses of the requested heavy bur@@ gl@@ ers are not known in natur@@ alisation , hints from the population are hop@@ ed and sought worship .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter .
the experience had shown that many escap@@ es are hiding in holiday destinations , it was the part of Europ@@ ol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website has been available www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ omy , more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online companions could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the release on the website .
travelers &apos; negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aires &apos; series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined trav@@ ellers on war foot@@ paths that claim a field in front of their mansion .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans in a field outside of a weal@@ thy road from Soli@@ hull , called the Million@@ aire &apos;s series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transp@@ orters from having arrived in May , without being deported from a tren@@ ch taken out by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ tile group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
the inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; You moved to the Monday evening when they were sent away by Bentley He@@ ath , where they were cast on the passages .
the Council has to be forced into action by shame , as it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and back now .
more we arrived late last night , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council from Birmingham knows how to handle it by taking long instruction to protect their parks .
I am living along the stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my comm@@ ences if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
a native who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; It is ri@@ di@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
speaking in the Council of Soli@@ hull said , &quot; We are aware of a un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the route brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible .
in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many locals call an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we proceed our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof forests is opened by Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel is Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
those are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof estate by the then ambi@@ ance of operating company mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , some 30 000 beds were lost per year and also proceeds through the local tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , a growing number of refugees , which arrived in the county , offered the hotel building to the governor along with a collective accommodation .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by placing a development plan to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all , Fre@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at the age of serious difficulties in the house .
he was supposed to be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with CEO Birgit Sch@@ erer was acquired in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern from a voluntary turnover in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of three @-@ star Plus tier under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the previous Hotel Birken@@ hof , some time construction containers in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear to be re@@ constructed .
the floors were torn out , blan@@ kets are partly dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspapers .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large wired showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything should be &quot; beautiful bourgeois @-@ up , &quot; which Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
it would not be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but it is already emphas@@ ized from a higher downtown level .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 guest rooms will rise wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both groups , groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel .
he talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and the tourist director Michael K@@ rau@@ se , so much more .
the visions of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after receiving the investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer is trying to set out exactly .
he expects almost a million euros .
the outdoor spaces are also brought on fron@@ mann , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is open from the restaurant , is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us special agent sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair with U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have chosen a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in the past weeks , the Committee recorded work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; written with appeal to people confidential .
the newspaper valu@@ ate the step as a sign , that Mu@@ eller expands its investigations and intensi@@ fy .
the CN@@ N station reported that in connection with a meeting between tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyer already in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps .
us Intelligence was accused of having mixed the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , purpos@@ efully at the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were inter@@ signs between tr@@ umps campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are supposed to act as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to a study , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment under the magni@@ fying glass .
the Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ kom@@ er Tr@@ ump placed himself personally in the centre and for the accus@@ ation that the President may have ob@@ struc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to check and decide the evidence in possible fail@@ ures and decide whether to be indicted .
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore also called im@@ ar@@ k@@ ers .
mostly they are switched on , if it is about bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to charge people on behalf of E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N station , pre @-@ inv@@ it@@ ations have already been shown to make the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian partner .
people who were involved in the meeting were called to be a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also tr@@ umps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ al@@ ant campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in conversation with him .
right @-@ experts told on Thursday evening in US television that the susp@@ ect show that Mu@@ eller does not leave himself in his work and that he if it should be necessary , quickly trade .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
however , the en@@ forcement of the ab@@ ums is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new disclos@@ ure , President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to show out the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the issue give the Democrats an opportunity to feel &quot; good , because they have nothing else that they can talk about . &quot;

former FB@@ I CEO James Com@@ ey has said three times that I won &apos;t be determined against the President .
you have no reason to have changed that something changed , it was called in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ran@@ kings , accus@@ ations have been loud against Tr@@ ump , who wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump led him to a attitude of investigations against the then national security advis@@ ors Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President is under big pressure for the investigation .
according to the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees .
that dissolved spectac@@ ulations about what Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to be released .
different from the Congress of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , to later back to President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has found a position in which he could be fired theore@@ tically on fin@@ es of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic transmit@@ ters , on Thursday , presented bills on Thursday , after which the agent can no longer be dismissed .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg acceler@@ ates in Antarc@@ tica
in the western Arctic the giant ice@@ berg has loos@@ ened by the almost seven times of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Bremer@@ haven Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than one tr@@ illion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 s@@ q km large s@@ lap will run to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest gl@@ ands that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people is not going out of him .
to the extent of climate change has played a role in demol@@ ition of the ice@@ berg , according to research information is un@@ clear .
however , in total , however , for around 30 years , a series of unusual inter@@ bur@@ sts in the region , writes the US Research Center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a background background .
according to many researchers , this could be linked to global warming .
the fra@@ ctional Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow on the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this circle was the balance of wa@@ xes and dis@@ rup@@ ture some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i is crum@@ bling there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge has never gone back as much as currently .
in addition , the ice plate stand under tension and can disin@@ tegr@@ ate if a piece turns off at a key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i and ice@@ berg does not increase sea level as it p@@ ushes the water on the water and fl@@ ushes the ice so much water as it turns into the melt itself .
however , the loss of pet@@ ition leads , that the glacier directly flows into the sea and could drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a low extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to AW@@ I data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest ski fe@@ ather in Antarc@@ tica after AW@@ I data .
at the edge of the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , the front edge towards the free ocean is approx . 200 metres .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers did not withdraw the demol@@ ition of this giant ice@@ berg on climate change , so in recent decades many d@@ ow@@ ards are broken down in the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula .
this long tip of the Antarc@@ tic extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have been heated by around three degrees during the past 50 years and is t@@ aming to the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CDU wants pets at the staff
as it becomes more difficult to occupy free places , the CDU , from the employer association organis@@ es to be more attractive .
the Kre@@ ist@@ ag made 41 new jobs in the administration only shortly before the summer rec@@ ess .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day behind .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
about 620 applications were noted that this year had to be noted .
however , the circle still lack the staff to handle the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are currently 50 positions in the district in M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things doctors and engineers as well as forces of the general administration .
the CDU would now want to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG into the administration building .
the administration should develop a concept for personnel production and personal development after the desire of the parties . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term Bed@@ ations , but to counter@@ act @-@ proof the candidate of application , says it .
the overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ starter and include a training offensive , calling for CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has something to do with staff problems you did not know earlier .
other towns present good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is of a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
this involves a high number of employees who leave disease or age due to the service .
t@@ allest time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Peop@@ les , leader of the CDU , continues with his party beyond their joint application .
he worked out already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a strong surprise , when he publicly presented to the personnel expenses and start@@ led the remaining parties .
people want to check out all the possibilities , which allow one withdrawal from the municipal employer .
&quot; if we cannot come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county administration should be with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the circular cities - one pet tari@@ ff , &quot; so people .
this means that the CDU , employees and officials will pay better to pay the tari@@ ffs for public service in fact .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly determined , increases or more money is available only when changes to a higher level of employment .
however , the tasks of the circle has grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established in which employees will take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy shar@@ pen@@ ed the tone to a NGO @-@ migrants &quot; rescue boat
Italy has NGOs that deplo@@ y rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ns that they may not continue to continue to comply with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Home Affairs Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ n@@ itis alert came a day after the Italian authorities learned a boat from the German aid organisation &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; having effectively collabor@@ ated with human traff@@ ic@@ kers in a way that simpli@@ fies illegal immig@@ ration .
the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since a year , refused to express itself about extensive proposals from the Italian public Prosecutor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in a statement about social media .
&quot; we can judge all the accus@@ ations currently being collected , since we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities gave the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , which has been monitoring since October .
it is assumed that its crew of din@@ gh@@ y migrants are delivered on board them directly from men &apos;s hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was thought only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the nu@@ des of the pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of ob@@ serving as the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , rescue attach@@ ments in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not super@@ vised by any other motives .
boats must be monitored under the Code of Con@@ duct , such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , especially an Italian police officers , which monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue entries have so far been agreed to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ ate Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter stated on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed un@@ necessarily but acceptable , as they would not make any &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said by now that the number of migrants arrived to Italy in recent weeks , which resulted in the efforts to strengthen the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast @-@ guards and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister .
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month , with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants attemp@@ ting to reach those countries in the hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine We@@ il@@ ders Biker , the &quot; Berlin &quot; out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim , the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , just four days to enjoy the tribute .
three ordered guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look across from the pe@@ eling forests and the up@@ stream levels .
there was always longer asc@@ ents in between , for the long tri@@ ans s@@ wo@@ oned .
the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim for Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .

sitting these Sports Stars in the future to sit through computer consoles , instead of fighting wind and weather for the stadium cre@@ ek ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious sector , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - large stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high scores included .
these have also recognized the first federal lig@@ aver@@ s that are increasingly eng@@ aging in this area .
in early 2015 , V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last followed by V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport company in mid @-@ July and launched two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to am@@ aze some new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Managing Board of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure , &quot; on this move , several clubs are rising . &quot;
at the coming weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA hosted the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which Gam@@ er organizes various clubs like each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .

and : the clubs attemp@@ ting to capture all sorts of markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract you could be present much more often in these markets , than once a year the federal government to send to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
for E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just hit football @-@ simulation FIFA at the competition plane .
long ago , like in ordinary sport , le@@ agues have become well established in which the professionals can compete against each other .
and in the Asian games E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about the right sport ?
for many , the performance is sure to get used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ y has long dealt with the issue .
for the Professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne E @-@ Sport is a sport because he &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions which can be found in the classic sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
besides , cogn@@ itive abilities need , a technical and tac@@ tic understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise in the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but stro@@ us also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping will always be a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic Sports are missing .
scientists emphas@@ ise the highly integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are international on the way , this is like a big global family , since there are no inter@@ cultural in@@ ances .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts its growth in the E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly by advertising , sponsor@@ ship , and big tournaments .
turnover has to be at 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of soccer league this is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writing the del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International are already many countries far@@ ther .
large markets are Asia and the US , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .

Michelle Carter found suicide for suicide because of the texts that Conrad Roy condemned to suicide
a woman from Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encour@@ ages her friend &apos;s friend and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , aged 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind bars and five years were exposed on par@@ ole .
Carter was convicted of the death of Conrad Roy in June , having taken life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that both it and Mr Roy had been involved in a mental illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Carter , with tears in her eyes , stood with folded hands and down his eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the At@@ tor@@ ney at the Court .
&quot; she finished his life to improve their own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has shown no repent@@ ance . &quot;
but Car@@ ters attorney , it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance , which she completely regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it &quot; doesn &apos;t give any day that I didn &apos;t dare to lose the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said that she will never be heard of knowledge &quot; that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; no longer this single person , with whom I was together since my birth , is a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life with me , &quot; she said .
the case seems to be a legal tender , since there is no law in Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , who makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead in a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention , after car@@ et@@ ters reveal text not@@ ices that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the eyes before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad , &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is entering the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched carefully through the death of Roy and ordered that she would be able to take advantage of any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
to the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted of murder of her British resident in Italy in 2007 , was acquitted of her two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , Thir@@ ty Years old , released a Com@@ mentary in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain , no co@@ incidence is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern joins the conver@@ fed Cup winner for a big season - does not harm adding extra motivation .
something was different on his seat in the cabin , that Joshua chose Joshua immediately , even if the extra piece of clothes was very small .
but because far and wide , on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neuer has to see , he made himself the Bin@@ de content in the arm .
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; told the con@@ voy Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bayern @-@ Captain .
good , the unit could have run better than in 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could interpre@@ t the sign of the coach as well .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen to be chosen by youth players , de@@ preci@@ ants and just chosen professionals of the C @-@ El@@ f professionals , but he was chosen as a guide .
su@@ ck@@ ery is best distributed to those who want to we@@ y a lot , which you want to keep in good mood .
those who have chosen to en@@ close the heritage of Lah@@ m can use a small extra @-@ motivation only well .
K@@ imm@@ ick confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : &quot; to take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old works as a mini @-@ l@@ ame on the field .
right back , this is now his position , the white bin@@ ge on the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked in this start@@ it like the one that can take the ru@@ d@@ der also best in his hand .
he instructed , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed troops .
he had a view of the whole , while many others were involved with themselves .
Vid@@ al thus , with his lack of fitness to over@@ play ( folding hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato Sen@@ ches , on the devil , to start out of the benefits of the Asia journey ( folding only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le therefore , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ tri@@ k@@ ot did not fall any negative .
after all , it folds quite well .
Sü@@ le ran along with K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both ag@@ ated so@@ vereign .
the vig@@ or@@ ously occupied Nap@@ oli storm did a lot of trouble , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to get a few times in the game @-@ up .
his colleague Rud@@ y indeed gave up that the result was &quot; not the case as we hop@@ ed it would be . &quot;
but he was showing ordinary performance on the debut .
play re@@ location , temp@@ o change : &quot; I have also fet@@ ched this style . &quot;
as usual , the Bayern World is still present for the new additions , one saw the con@@ sign@@ ment to the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
and I said goodbye after a few cra@@ cking statements in the back of his new fellow players .
there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting phr@@ ase : &quot; what &apos;s going on here I already noticed .
with Bavaria you simply have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .

company happy with rh@@ age @-@ w@@ ast@@ ical minister : Economy lo@@ oses Wis@@ dres@@ temp@@ o
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able to reconc@@ ile the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , nor economic administration of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is shown by more than one year in which the new Finance Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies in the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Union of Trieste ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the largest revers@@ al at the infrastructure policy follows the infrastructure of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au , the country &apos;s priority list is now at the top .
this year the ministry is hoping for a planning procedure until 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West over@@ h@@ aul of Trier , which stands in the state &apos;s urgent necessity .
the goal is to take the course in December 2020 , says S Minister &apos;s spokesperson on Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us is looking for a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( MC@@ CI ) aims to increase the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase the market in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports since ten years .

Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ makers are faced with a counter response
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer software to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have greatly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regard to carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered to be car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , plants for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases , also take to what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused to ignore the powerful auto companies and to ignore any signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of the Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called sealing devices that have been tested if a car has been tested , but with normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in the Audi plant was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused the system to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that concentrated on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be heavy duty by Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is largely imp@@ aired by Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ us@@ asen as well as the laughter to the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was temporarily one of the most published cartoon illustr@@ ator , the b@@ oll@@ us@@ ages of his figures are its trademark .
the Argentin@@ ian city also stands out with 85 .
his message : laughing , it &apos;s too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the early years as an artist he made himself a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation . what fru@@ str@@ ates him .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 1960s the breakthrough came out : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in &quot; Stern and other leading magazines about the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again the artist had inspired artists of cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures , in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own figures , he is still alive today , works almost ten hours daily .
over cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for large and small , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches still find its thre@@ e@@ worthy figures around the world .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any favourite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as counter players .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , 2019 is supposed to be found on the cinema screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they are saying , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o says .
the script is not written by him .
therefore he rather relies on the TV show , which is produced in original drawings , like his original drawings .
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender resulting in d@@ rought conditions due to d@@ rought in d@@ rought conditions and because of the in@@ tra@@ geous insects falling down , which try scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence was effectively al@@ armed because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and in the fall much more .
this has imp@@ lications for the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil not only lu@@ res for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than having long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed , and either weak@@ ened or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered in consideration are a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .

the murder of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa by organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ceas@@ ing drug wars .
but this day , in the shadow of its own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , which were the aim of a attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or at home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they kindly ask the repor@@ ter to propos@@ e name for each column - no proof is necessary , perception and abdominal muscles .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the pay@@ roll list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of bre@@ wh@@ ide that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resting periods from violence , and while in the whole country the bodies accum@@ ulate , are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to have taken his office in December 2012 , there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is the publisher and her inspiration of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
his lack is perceived deeply , despite its presence exists - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his central finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; is located on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties with Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts to show his smiling face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although the At@@ tor@@ ney General was set up in 2010 , in order to process the cases by journalists , it was led to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murder , which are associated with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely applied to court .
at Ri@@ od@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , even though they are in@@ consol@@ ing and even though the terrain is even more verb@@ al .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the reason , we suspic@@ ions all . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced out of his car and he was shot down for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - being translated with &quot; twelve river &quot; .
the support ran out in his car and damaged it close by .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ours would tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the theme of Val@@ dez , there are practically nothing but silence .
after his arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition in the United States in January was Sin@@ al@@ oa become one of the most terri@@ fying batt@@ les@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val@@ ing fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it does not make anything that in Sin@@ al@@ oa any day or several people are shot on the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of fle@@ dged , two @-@ storey maus@@ ole@@ ums that are larger than many houses for the living .
for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state , with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
in February , the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alling cart@@ ell@@ ations in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this publication allows the sons to be angry every copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez for it , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for his own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for north @-@ protests in 2003 when he completed together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without breaking the rob@@ ber@@ y problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
over time , the newspaper rec@@ ted a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and increased turnover and advertising .
repor@@ ters loved it , difficult to publish investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories , which nobody dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs history , wherever it was .
he gave himself up voluntarily that he had fear .
&quot; I would like to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa is a way of life &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October .
&quot; you have to take over the job that fall@@ eth you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fe@@ odo@@ ce @-@ Team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could curse , like a do@@ ck@@ workers , was a teacher who had gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and rating , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always move to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table .
now they ask : was his love for a routine his destruction ?
his death also urged us to issue their own ass@@ ump@@ tions on how to do their job best , and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their hiding start and country run@@ ways , &quot; to move on drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ care and self @-@ maintenance .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , The publisher of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then it happened with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ al@@ oa no more - as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , where a gi@@ f@@ ty mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative car@@ g@@ gers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce posed for safety training , there were suddenly no cell phones allowed . days earlier became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico have been used .
outside the heat , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen which identified the Governor itself as un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug abuse are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce blocked on three main stories .
it was the assassin@@ ation of the brother of Julio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an exc@@ pos@@ é to state spending , which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of govern@@ ors .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the district , guided by a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advis@@ able when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug traff@@ ic@@ kers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter lear@@ nt from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician based on the ruling Inst@@ itutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly all the century .
recently several PR@@ I @-@ Govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this local restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; gu@@ z@@ man went into a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the reader was seen by the column of Val@@ dez as the best known source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier , we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim physi@@ stat@@ ure .
&quot; all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers that are protest@@ ing against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff had become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez pic@@ ks up a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the pro@@ secutor .
Salvador Ad@@ amed van@@ ished three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists have become as lou@@ dly as journalists in organized protests by the SOS Press &quot; organised in organized protests .
this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa in the day after the assassin@@ ation of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to mar@@ ry journalists and destroy them because they have told the truth .
she has been asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is worried that her rage has hurt her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were organized by organised crime officials and a comparable society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that Reporter may not only be killed by drugs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces , who were involved in organized crime under a blanket .
in the past year more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials reported more than half the attacks .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the mor@@ als have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ia in the northern state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed from the etas AF : &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone lay beside her se@@ perate head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern State state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassin@@ ation of the Cor@@ si@@ ze@@ al Cor@@ n in March .
others continue to do such as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the murder of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly presented the drug cart@@ els with an editorial page on the title page &quot; What do you want about us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled to their home countries or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and seek dangers .
and sometimes they are hunting , as apparently the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , indicates that the drug traff@@ icking is terri@@ fied .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell and so I became writers , &quot; he said .
at midnight , last Friday when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat at the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , at once all their phones began to h@@ um .
a series of shooting stars with band@@ sp@@ as and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan site had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of car@@ tel em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
on the ground floor they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about your mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enen is close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who stopped W@@ ou@@ ache to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid of all , they didn &apos;t show it .
the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps under the huge portrait of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole Sin@@ al@@ oa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used the cam@@ ouflage to soak off his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a sc@@ ary .
now , researchers have discovered that the first discover@@ ies of an incredible rhin@@ o &apos;s work of an Canadian mountain work were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his scal@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they could have had something from a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report published in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; referred to him as &quot; the mo@@ cked din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who ever found it , and one of the best Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s &quot; specimens of the world . &quot;
fossil remains a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has researchers who describe it as a &quot; really remarkable &quot; , ast@@ ron@@ gly
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant e@@ ater is the best known F@@ ossil in its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , as he held on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ en@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met on something that fired on the surrounding rock out of the place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy @-@ cl@@ ump .
after all of this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just b@@ tw@@ inkle in the eyes , you might almost feel that it was sleeping , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible .
&quot; it is going to go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa from the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant e@@ ater , even though it is covered with arm@@ or , is similar to a converting tanks , probably threatened by me@@ ats or din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the heavily ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from boot@@ legs , and used a par@@ atro@@ op@@ ic technique that is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to blend better in his surroundings and to sof@@ ten his enemies , experts say that it was threatened by many din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now exhibited in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7.000 hours in doing it carefully .
the aston@@ ishing conservation of presenting enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ or about his body .
she discovered the union , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of sufficient pressure was hun@@ ted by meat vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , that the evolution was the increase in confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals , who deplo@@ y the counter @-@ sh@@ ady - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or gir@@ dles - are much smaller and vulner@@ able as a prey , which indicates that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; powerful cra@@ f@@ tier behaviour on a massive , heavily ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s have been the cra@@ yon time , &quot; Brown said .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows also that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s bay was bay .
scientists still investig@@ ate the animal on his life , including his conservative min@@ ig@@ ar to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , when he died , went into a river and pushed out into the sea , where he sank back to the sea .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as South @-@ flows today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is totally covered with conservative le@@ aking skin , but remains in three dimensions and keeping the original shape of the animal . &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost as looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you just shot a little with your eyes , you might almost feel that he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who stood on two legs , und@@ ressed the earth .
even though the king of them who lived Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ aurus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists who seem to see their latest findings in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was di@@ ver@@ ted after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ ified in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , then on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ en@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the preserved Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures had an average of 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed for up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch sp@@ ikes , which ra@@ ped from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant e@@ ater was em@@ powered by the western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s kept its arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin is still hol@@ ded lined plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko on National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of maintenance is such &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the conf@@ using is .
the remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are stra@@ pped up .
I can count the d@@ and@@ ru@@ ff at his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass production on the A8 : many los@@ ers
severe accidents on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 trucks are involved in a mass @-@ production plant .
there are numerous injured , mil@@ eage - and aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A8 ) , around 20 people had been viol@@ ated on Thursday afternoon by a mass ar@@ bo@@ char@@ age .
after the first data of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock mid@@ side between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 cars , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ linked together .
the exact number of injured were no details at first .
they handle light to moderate injuries , said a police @-@ qui@@ ver .
a big range of life@@ vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed in direction of Munich .
a ten kilometres long rear stretch was formed in the direction of Munich .
like a AZ repor@@ ter , it also came on the co@@ aster track to massive disability - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade de@@ composed the license plates of the vehicle , which now have to calculate with sensitive strap .
shortly after 18 : 45 then a second accident occ@@ ured on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced , nothing really is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or it is en@@ gros@@ sed in his work and just has a brilliant mind .
and then : tail .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes a soft or irrit@@ ate the passenger from the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing a cart@@ il@@ ess ticket control .
one simply confirms the mobile phone that is taken and utilized by the ticket .
a trial operation is currently underway .
&quot; the offer reaches , we extend it out .
it is likely to be available at many other traffic routes in Germany in the beginning of the year , &quot; said a train speaker .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the rail@@ ways with no creative application .
in order to be able to use , however , some requirements have to be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
you must also have bought it via the app by rail , DB Navigator , what is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : you go to the train , the ticket will call on &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
during the test customers , button on electronic application appears .
the train conductor will receive a message on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X has taken on the train and took the booked seat for the Y .
comes the train conductor with a ticket inspection at number Y he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
so you can further sleep , keep on silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two benefits : one for the client , one for the train , which is to use the passengers .
&quot; who would relax without ticket inspection through our train accompanying staff , check in the DB Navigator simply .
this enables passengers to design their travel time in their personal journey , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing executive board of DB remote traffic .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to meet individual customer needs . &quot;
those who travels , knows that in addition to delays and digest@@ est trains , the ticket vou@@ chers are among the greatest troub@@ les .
because you often have , in any case , but one of the Mit@@ reis@@ enden did not take all the documents which you need for the recovery of online tickets .
either credit card or identity card is missing or a document you have to prove .
the result is endless discussions between train@@ ee and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the evenings or greater spac@@ ing and delays in the control of your own tickets and will take care of taking care of other concerns .
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and even for the ICE ICE model 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked yet .
how one activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel was sh@@ aken to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis born in St. Louis was born on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat that she rented and sc@@ roll@@ te through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone from high school .
&quot; the police has just killed an 18 year old child and still lies on the road , &quot; he was there .
pu@@ zz@@ led , because nobody has posted the information on their feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continually calling on its tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed Black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white c@@ ops in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he posted a picture of brow@@ ns lively bodies , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; said Fer@@ rel .
but death was for them and their community nothing new .
she moved her mobile pf@@ one , later on in the evening to twe@@ et over people on Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos from the police station and the people that cried out , and of a man who claimed to be the father &apos;s father , who said a sign with the signature : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed with which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demon@@ strat@@ ors with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , secured an other polic@@ eman sh@@ ot@@ gun and shou@@ ted : &quot; I will kill you all the animals . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; the Fer@@ rell ten@@ ds to their testimony .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and we call it typical . &quot;
at that moment , I felt sh@@ aking .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she repeated her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive on the next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from October 11 .
it is a story of survival and the protest , the love and loss , of the strength and resistance of people who live in community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel with her daughter wearing a cau@@ dal dress and a matching crown , she spoke to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , spoke the two of them talking about this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to struggle for what they have to believe ? &quot; re@@ minded of what she said .
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct .
I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it needs to be aware of it and it will be drawn .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I was lucky enough to give her a experience , that she is personally no ek@@ lat@@ ent rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would prove bad service , they keep away from it . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a village across the police station , which was led to a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to transmit them to demon@@ strat@@ ors .
slowly , a new type of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m began to cul@@ turally shape .
&quot; my share vis@@ m has changed totally after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health un@@ even@@ ness in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel arrived at the evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
follow them , she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to call &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question was made into my mind , &quot; If you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on were not raised and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
follow @ Fi@@ on@@ awe@@ bed@@ itor Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist known for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ de@@ fi@@ kt .
his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rel , along with six other native people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after being shot .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; Davis .
&quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are portra@@ yed , for so I will be portra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ relative lives , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laughed , when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understood that it has to give a certain vulner@@ ability to this work and for the creation of black people . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls history plays the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , having marked the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly strug@@ gling at different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must carry the heavy burden of everything . &quot;
fol@@ ay@@ an in@@ sist@@ ed that &quot; the movement is truly held by black women and many black women . &quot;
but it is , however , that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ist type of action , &quot; which was chosen for the identity of their identity as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although she was at the fore@@ front , because with a life on these cros@@ sings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long , but the ra@@ cial links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area , which it calls her home : &quot; a may@@ hem . &quot;
she cl@@ oned herself at her singing and she feels obli@@ vious to her memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss@@ ing bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , even though it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the beginning of the pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in adv@@ o@@ cates and opponent .
cold makes the subject hardly any .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Popular and Bit@@ burg . &quot;
as the one bit to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) or &quot; This would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Rob@@ ots ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ing ) or quite simply : &quot; mag@@ n@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the adv@@ o@@ cates build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the remaining shops , fear the su@@ c@@ aries that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , in which the farmers market is on the market in which 13 direct suppliers will sell their products .
the construction will conclude with the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle in the new building - and for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the farm hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers always gladly .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would hope that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; if it has to be marketed in a market hall in the gallery , the rental amounts to the amount of rent .
but this should probably not be low with the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what purchasing positions in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
one can see how many stores are vac@@ ated here - some for months and years .
however , since there is not yet another weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the product offered there is freshly made , mostly offered directly by producers and is an attractive price .
as you see , cargo stores are rented in a shopping center just of larger companies , because the rent Mi@@ ets are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special transactions are almost no more and what is left of it , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farmers market place during the construction time ?
the old ED@@ EK@@ A would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or is it easy to drive out all shops from Bit@@ burg as a bit before ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it &apos;s just not going to work .
and a Shopping Center which stands empty , no one needs .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market , it is thanks to the mad many - as I find - out @-@ out projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the farmers market hall is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the center of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ visi@@ bly - they hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ be@@ ers and hair@@ cuts which were sent to you by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the c@@ utt@@ ings from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence after they publicly set Diplom@@ atic messages about the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition opened on 2nd August is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has been transformed into technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and dis@@ si@@ der@@ ing dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could look from M@@ anning and made out of the 30 portraits which can be interpreted using these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
M@@ anning , who was born by Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been talking about identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convicted by 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the spy Act , Computer and The@@ ft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that it gave only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white self @-@ la@@ zy , sitting in the M@@ anning obviously on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ ig is associated with which it has been associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has just returned from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ ical arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette mu@@ ffle and che@@ wing gum as extracted from the tr@@ ash to produce a picture of what these people might look like .
that was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not attend this time and she could not take pictures , so they took touch with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use were written to un@@ even letters , which during two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which had predicted a future in which the President Chel@@ ci@@ zing would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama indeed had only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ i was forced to call for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of congrat@@ ulation .
it is also available at the opening of the exhibition some Tie@@ fes and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump led a war on in@@ forman@@ ts from the administration camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ eters , which he should actually handle out further away .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been asked about the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in a visual reference at the gallery , the artistic statement called M@@ anning with their superior signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic de@@ frag@@ mentation , whose basis is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg had hop@@ ed to show the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways .
&quot; what people will hopefully be going on is that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly called genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows M@@ anning , as she dives together with a brush@@ cutter in hand from the discipl@@ ines of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they kiss your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; so we never have the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ ute from Philadelphia .
&quot; I still get go@@ ose of go@@ ose when talking about it . &quot;
M@@ anning hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition yet personally - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ak@@ ras which re@@ semble hor@@ des of protests .
this was not aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ers St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ ap@@ als were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of men , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
nation@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which was chosen as susp@@ ects , after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , his alleged involvement in W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued warran@@ ts for murder , as opposed to alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shown by Cook County State Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several j@@ acks .
a warning system was published by the Chicago police agency that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found victims with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared at the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ate the engra@@ vings as murder while the police actively searches for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
L@@ ath@@ em has been an exceptional Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an E @-@ Mail explanation that L@@ ath@@ em will be officially approved and excluded from joining the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain in order to help the US investig@@ ators in every conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot;
the testimony added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want that he placed himself .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demanding the susp@@ ects to oppos@@ e the authorities .
&quot; the police has an idea of her where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call from the building super@@ visor of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just had a mysterious tip that had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear if the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a multitude of mot@@ if@@ s , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA schedule in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President mut@@ ko
Russian Vice President Vital@@ y Mut@@ co said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for rest@@ oring the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA schedule was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented the second part of the road@@ map of WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ en@@ forcement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to concern himself .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , specifies that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have disclos@@ ed the reported results of the fac@@ tual @-@ sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport publicly supported by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ co said : &quot; we are leading the test , because our anti @-@ D@@ oping system has put one error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no state programmes , and we will not give something that does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA by the implementation of d@@ oping controls in Russia .
it was however permitted to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main quar@@ rel of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the Start U@@ ps that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the pol@@ ls did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not dare to process the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from outside around help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it enables companies to provide special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite managers and turn them directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they are now tools such as Stra@@ va , and Fitbit for pursu@@ it of their health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools of companies is used to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your staff think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and pol@@ ls of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company which at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives may have low secre@@ tion results - so you can re@@ bo@@ ve why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for start@@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility after an overview .
global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry may have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial technical website : let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , helps prevent and detect evil behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber recently filed itself as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent creates custom &quot; pulse &quot; pol@@ ls , to collect confidential responses in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can conduct bad behavior .
and when the chief business is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that its staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or rel@@ ent@@ less , it can experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , worker fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said QU@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations , has deployed Conver@@ cent for over 500 locations , to ensure that employees are aware of policies and processes and an easy way of achieving their corporate headquarters .
previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James V@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said it was not a good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ cent relies on , problems that were previously hi@@ ked by exec@@ u@@ tives , which were hidden in offices in cities or countries , were identified and spoken quickly as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair inter@@ ns .
&quot; I can closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 degree view of experience related to employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment legal disputes . &quot;
companies began to re@@ count Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e &apos;s commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen broke through the En@@ ron sc@@ andal caused by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal .
but it lasted until the Social Media came to their right , &quot; said that companies weren &apos;t able to stop drinking dirty laundry .
&quot; before using technology for the monitoring of ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and S@@ cent offer your software as a service , and will charge the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that supports the approval of venture capital investors , which supports both start@@ ups .
for funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , Conver@@ sion@@ ers received $ 10 million to finance the total capital to $ 47 million .
spar@@ kl@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and earned his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets , such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only In@@ serts .
staff want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites if their portfolio companies are well run . companies run well when employees are committed and eng@@ aging .
if the Analytics tools of third promise to increase engagement and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the staff &apos;s commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the managers are us@@ eless when managing a company does not take measures .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have been expecting a change in the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can be further dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 ideas , you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to be very committed to collecting data .
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow the staff , &quot; Don &apos;t you really heard me ?
are you taking care of this ?
and if you do not concern yourself , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , thus ret@@ arded .
and after gathering feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was capable of organizing several teams within the company by the quick@@ ness of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , and to add a communications training to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday the company will always receive new insights over the staff , and it hopes for a long term of view that leads to better bonds of workers in a industry that is well @-@ known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you will lose customers as well .
and if you lose customers , you will lose your company .
the N@@ CAA remove the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
at 23 o &apos;clock , there &apos;s a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint on one side of the new exercise fields on the campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final tests before they return to the next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is a real estate for the guys for the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was closed on Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has indeed extended its days - at least to the final on Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 begin to meet the already packed days of the player .
the course of the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the summer school six playing times in West@@ wood had practical exercises .
they are to be kept in the course of August 18 , 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he supports the rules of rules of N@@ CAA , even if they add another point to the more busy routes of the players .
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days to them , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; and they just worked out , they move on , they are great people .
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is closed , which is exposed to the clear view of its fields of an adjacent parking area and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , which is already occupied with foot@@ balls , which is a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task .
brood players will occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a spac@@ ed to give it a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched that people rent a room there and then adjust it there to record a practice .
if you have the video ob@@ and of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fac@@ tual review in the fight against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with error messages from third parties and their results in the original post , then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ news .
the company said in a statement on his website that it is started using the use of updated machine techniques to identify potential folders and send them to fac@@ to@@ Transfer , which may show results of the fac@@ to@@ test from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ized as one of the main const@@ itu@@ encies for so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ news , many of which believe they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has become a major political theme in Europe , with the French v@@ oters aged in May with false stories , and Germany should be punished by a plan to quickly eliminate the social media networks , as before the election there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation on German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to recognition , what stories of fac@@ ulty t@@ ailed third parties , people want more context to make good decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to report his feature to the &quot; in combination of the article &quot; and works on other modifications to his news feeds in order to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video , and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the ir@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ hi@@ val@@ ence of Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historic documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says happy with one acc@@ ord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages up to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac W@@ ley May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des which was based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s his thum@@ b @-@ print !
and letters always smell of smoke , because then a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the od@@ or has a effect as he would have himself as well .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so busy with old papers , he is assisted by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be f@@ rank &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Victor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and to study the numerous treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ t@@ ailed bra@@ ids at walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he mig@@ rated across the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on illustrations of his book .
then at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only awarded the full access to the last attempt , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which ar@@ ist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it to the attic . &quot;
ta@@ ill@@ cher , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , cards that have said : &quot; one could think that land conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let all go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to find out a bro@@ ader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a call which appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Immun@@ ology of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peas@@ antry started in this area and I thought , a insur@@ rection was a good start .
perhaps the two are linked together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who had told the history of the Jesu@@ it pilgri@@ m for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &quot; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &quot; in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler is portra@@ yed from the 18th century by filling his own fun@@ eral making a coff@@ in filled with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ tro@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &apos; the men seemed to be a bit of ga@@ it , always debts and money for things that they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men qu@@ en@@ ched their school crises when they married weal@@ thy women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap of good looking boys , with a talent to advert@@ ise within . &quot;
Rho@@ des at the end of his approach in the castle is Rho@@ des in search of other unique write experiences
he has taken a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ bes group , the grounds of a shelter from the early 20th century , which has been rec@@ eded by nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the wra@@ pping of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team would like to keep the logo and the slogan to Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th as a highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really think , write it on their un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
actually we are the firm belief that we know as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
when the action is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a unique promise , which gives the city a unique unique feature . &quot;
finally , she is standing in the competition with other municipalities .

military reform in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ ans fear of the army
each year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es pen@@ sion@@ ings and grants of the officer cor@@ ps .
such also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no more in the building of the general staff , as previously , but in the office of prime minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Deputy chie@@ fs and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs were also part of the advis@@ ors .
in doing so , civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number .
the government re@@ treats the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ da@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the Com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were depos@@ ed .
since the failed coup , President Erdoğan has fired 169 on 326 Gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections for the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ gers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , that Erd@@ ogan as a wire coup .
up to 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly at the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ ogan already referred to the overthrow of &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ ogan really have the army in control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns of an increasing Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army which manif@@ ests itself among others in the up@@ lift of the head@@ scarf ban for solar dat@@ ors , the newspaper wrote .
the grandfather in the army and security forces continues to go .
in mid @-@ July Erd@@ ogan left more 73@@ 95 national service agents , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
thus , it seemed as Erd@@ ogan was t@@ amed the military .
gener@@ als are older than the real masters of the country .
three times they slip on appeal to their role as a guard of the sec@@ ular government order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least under appeal to the reform proposed by the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ ogan is driven by Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in a &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , a particularly named officer that seek@@ eth for the coup attempt of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
if this is true , Nato could not allow Nato to be cold .
anyway , there are no doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ging of the Turkish army .
leadership structures and oper@@ ation@@ als are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US Immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he pre@@ views to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for the obtaining of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the present system .
this new Candi@@ date procedure will come to the candidate who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
ministry aims to refurb@@ ish distance for race @-@ shuttle
over the past few months , over the future of the race has been con@@ tested - now it should go very fast .
before the end of the year the island is supposed to be built on the Tourist Rail@@ road .
in order to ensure the future of the race with no long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , we will begin work on the track this year .
&quot; with the decision to further order and restore the distance of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is based on this particular interest , &quot; explained by the Under@@ secretary of Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the repair of the course was estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros .
of that sum , the country is taking 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will currently be voted , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South @-@ Thur@@ ing@@ ia as the operator are already not@@ e@@ worthy of technical details .
&quot; the road@@ map , which applied to the vehicles and the quality standards , said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned agreement between the ministry and the platform will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this will allow the race to be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the racing platform Shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot was tested in the course of a pilot company , whether the distance of sufficient many people is used to order them regular again in the future .
the route is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned
just as you thought that there will be no longer cra@@ zier than in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are moment@@ arily a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the company supply every amount of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the release of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone , which feels warm - with aware of human reactions by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt its robot according to its convic@@ tions &quot; and also select it , from the eye @-@ colour of the robot on the shape of the breast to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there will be more troubled , as many robots possess the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; which would look like a step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicon .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot , for example , allows users to adapt their users to the properties that they look appealing , such as a school@@ ing .
and then there &apos;s still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion on pre@@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of offensive concerns and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ med the site of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day , she has her m@@ oods - very like real people !
she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many inci@@ dents regarding the rise of Sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the under@@ scores of Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah goes on , troubled one in most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s called on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deep in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional addition .
most men will obviously not stick sex robots , and while the FR@@ R hits their growing popularity , they are nevertheless pro@@ vision@@ ally on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what is sick@@ ly out of the boundary zones , can be very educational in terms of the mind of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until they have permission to use the free market for this .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed Sex robot in a time emerged in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there have been a president in the White House , who accused women attacked sexually .
the most fear@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ c@@ ate body and the em@@ itted eyes but how realistic this vision affects .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump but in the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical re@@ semb@@ lan@@ ce to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even with por@@ po@@ x propor@@ tions ) .
their history wants them to feel human beings that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , in the point when it comes to its &quot; person@@ alities &quot; the robot is no real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from her companion .
they have no medi@@ ation or background music , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
put in other words : they are counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ful slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ emer of 2017 : maid
tr@@ umps big power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ te@@ dan@@ k@@ fest there were in the USA newspapers with advice about how to circum@@ navigate with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing cou@@ plings .
we all suppose to make our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power Tr@@ ump , to accommodate families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ left po@@ et@@ ess who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visited New York this week .
they re@@ minded me , that the unit can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows she knows , including the rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , with whom they had fought for decades , suddenly and very pec@@ uli@@ ar on the same side .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it feels in a further context that this also brings significant risks .
the left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the exhibiting effect of his presidency has the force to push all of us to the right .
when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y way of making us no longer rep@@ utable one day .
however , there is an even fri@@ ght@@ ful long@@ time scenario , norm@@ alizes in the Tr@@ ump rep@@ ubli@@ can of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a ep@@ it@@ ome of n@@ ac@@ tics .
I find myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ ari@@ ous version of the mad - the dog looking at the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur as very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump walks , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans must be in good health to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ou@@ sel &apos;s car park and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when no caffeine needed .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ ky and the animals turn to look at full fear - very dark and the cli@@ m@@ ess music convey@@ s this very strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city are saying : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not righteous to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not over the day , when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss cottage - the subject @-@ pub - Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
but Central Park @-@ Car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since two years old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on that and all have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it .
on the other hand , in this week , I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of five to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to pay the valu@@ ation with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor wife at the department store was more exc@@ essi@@ vely , while I am tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us covered with chest pain from prison
Pist@@ ori@@ us had the prison for the second time on a hospital visit .
in the past year , he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of but@@ lers , according to the disease , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder by an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a perpet@@ ual court .
he killed jet@@ ty in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 , while he shot it several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he was his friend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal in@@ tru@@ der which hid herself in the c@@ ab .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to app@@ el this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , by which they say they are too dense .
the National Criminal Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the verdict can be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is aware that his sentence increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
the last of the Blum@@ berger schools were r@@ ushed out of the H@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen for vac@@ ations and into the leading schools .
three of the students in the future leave the secondary school , four to the secondary school .
school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the village of Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen on Tuesday evening .
as a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes were elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle that grew up in the chicken , but then released into freedom .
the m@@ lower notes introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chick@@ ens .
a small eagle first came out instead of a chicken .
but the hope to turn out of him a chicken , spread the eagle in a high mountain spread forth his wings , and escaped .
in addition , the classes followed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders bore to w@@ ager .
the Adler stand for the integration , said to instru@@ ctors Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young was different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny to be free .
she wished each four @-@ kl@@ ach@@ ler that he feels in his new school .
we followed , thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who again jumps back with lesson periods , and the representatives coming together .
the cooking time is over , the classroom Sophia Schumacher declared .
they leave their pupils after two years of teaching only very odd as it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the qu@@ ach@@ ment .
for the graduation , all students had followed a song of summer time and holiday periods .
with the children , great joy broke out .
eight first sket@@ ches are registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for Il@@ legal Camp@@ ings in Greece , quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of the 1st August , a group of illegal people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have shar@@ pen@@ ed the control of the free camp@@ uses and place every one who is found in a place that is not thought of for this purpose , serious financial pen@@ alties .

the ministry said that the Court can impos@@ e a fine of money .
software Update for Diesel Cars : what You Need To Know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
you should improve the emission behaviour of the emissions trading emissions of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe provides ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the handled software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin .
their retro@@ fitting was ordered by the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced an excellent implementation in the coming months , but is still not an exact date .
Daimler convey@@ ed to write any subject .
if anyway an inspection may be due , it will be done in their framework .
how long should the changes apply ?
&quot; difficult to say &quot; means S@@ met@@ anin .
the connections of the manufacturer &apos;s engagement as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen how the deal@@ ership can act on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should it last ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming it could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen family ?
the ACE closes down .
presumably foreign manufacturers would trace , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price breakdown of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fear that .
but just in the regions , where dri@@ fts became threat@@ ening .
there is no loss of losses in rural areas so far .
the ACE closes , with a sale yet to be waiting .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in the Washington .
the first prize was promised by President Tr@@ ump , politics .
one of the winners will not come - protest .
the Cool J ( 49 ) receives one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center as the first R@@ apper .
this year , singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , and the chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be delivered at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will stage a reception together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award .
the award winner announced with progressive TV series announced that this was due to participate in the Gala .
he said : &quot; the New York Times &quot; said : &quot; this presidency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights , even the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed , they will use tr@@ ump to make sense of view .
according to the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the previous winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ ranks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s City Bu@@ ilder , goes to pension in the coming year .
the place is already written - appropriate applicants are rare .
W@@ acker is W@@ acker City Bu@@ ilder since 31 years .
and the work is still fun , as he taught in the press talk .
he reports from diverse , but also demanding tasks , which are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , no application is shown to fill the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
thus - adher@@ ance to the regular period of notice - still enough time for el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach has been a member of the administrative district as a sub @-@ law office , the Candi@@ date must submit relevant fast@@ eners .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they cannot fill it any more , citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg .
but the city &apos;s proximity to it is important , W@@ acker , who also reports from a good company climate as well as good sen@@ timent between authority and citizens .
more than 30 years in office , several major projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is assured over the office and its staff .
but also in the future , diverse projects are based on the agenda : the re@@ shaping of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ n@@ fen@@ park@@ land are stim@@ ulated .
the cinema bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium extension is still a theme .
the latter alone will strike at about 1.5 million euros under beech , &quot; if we do it correctly , W@@ ack@@ ers thought .
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city building master of large games .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener , there can be quite flexible in many things .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; h@@ ack@@ ers , and the design of green spaces is often comm@@ ended by citizens and visitors .
since the old town stands as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; one eye to it &quot; if new buildings are approved , &quot; st@@ resses the cre@@ eping car@@ et@@ aker .
for the Stadt@@ bau@@ Master , high responsibility already carries responsibility .
he is builder , &quot; at the end everything works here over my table . &quot;
in support and coordination , he can count on many years of employee : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( high @-@ building ) has been doing for ten years , Manfred Scho@@ er ( drau@@ ght ) for 15 years .
also , that his successor has long remains , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified with the place . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further design of the city .
who wants to bury Roland W@@ acker , should have completed a completed academic or Bachelor &apos;s studies as a Graduate Engine@@ er or Bachelor in Master &apos;s Architecture and have a good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and planning rights .
the city office building has high @-@ quality construction , construction planning , bar@@ b@@ loss@@ oms , urban property , urban property with building yard and urban gar@@ dening and lower building authority , including the monument protection .
bike on pipes are thrown off : ground line blocked
according to the police , unknown offen@@ ders have had the blue bicycle from the track to be placed on the lines in the Le@@ ob@@ ener Strasse ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male dancers and are looking for the night hours after them .
near the crime scene , a thr@@ ottle sco@@ oter and a bike driver were observed at the crime scene .
&quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the off@@ ender could have brought themselves in great danger and also end@@ anger the train traffic .
in addition to the damage at Lo@@ k and the equipment as well as the late @-@ moving transport costs , even pel@@ on@@ als of rail customers might remain on the perpet@@ rators .
the speaker said in total , as a result of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said .
the damage were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south route could be led without disability .
almost ten passenger cars were out of Friday afternoon , two of them concerned the district traffic .
freight trains were not falling , but they were late , however .
according to Ö@@ BB &apos;s spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced roughly 200 metres high .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate can help relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
however , a new study claims the opposite : a diet which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US , affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain , caused mag@@ n@@ fs and bloody attacks , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , loss of weight and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers usually come to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers were found at the Washington University to develop the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins that promote immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant digest@@ ion .
the senior Sci@@ entist , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that Immun@@ e cells in the gut will pat@@ rol in order to make sure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food , do not enter the body .
cells that are capable of unable to trigger infections , are offset by cells which protect the tolerance and damage the body without being sensitive to sensitive tissues .
when the balance is too far towards infection , it may result in an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments I was found that a kind of tolerance condu@@ it imm@@ unity occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice of their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and a combination of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an is toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel problems , if the same system also ra@@ ves in humans .
the Post@@ doctoral Award in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was searching for a kind of immun@@ ology that found the tolerance when it found out that a group of study group had such cells , but another group of the same is that it had not been accommodated .
it susp@@ ects that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ scope of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
mice of mice were sequ@@ enced by DNA sequences and six bacterial species were found in mice with the immune cells , but was missing in mice .
mice were taken up in a ster@@ ile environment so they did not have a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria spread the immune system , the researchers L. re@@ uter@@ i could grow in a fluid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to in@@ mature immun@@ o@@ cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an met@@ abolic syndrome , known as the in@@ dol 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the food of mice , increased number of such cells by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical gains have hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same toler@@ ant condu@@ it cells such as mice , and that most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i protect the intestinal tract .

Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , at Manchester United , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea has started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Super @-@ Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and impres@@ sing in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed to give only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was able to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks So@@ ccer , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him be ready so@@ oner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started at the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho as its start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent Conc@@ ern@@ ing in this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho loved three more new ones , but he in@@ sist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four main obligations .
&quot; three out of four , thank you for making the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four from four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the Boeing aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner about the US , which is several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar monitors the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a test test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind twi@@ sted him : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel , the SPD boss , looked up and prime minister of prime minister before election always with a certain concern to Berlin .
just no fire from the party , merely no head@@ wind from the League , as the main desire of the election champion .
since Martin Schulz has changed the party , the fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with growing ten@@ dencies are ob@@ serving the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als .
what Mr Schulz from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach .
there were deep suggestions .
and one after another .
the League @-@ CDU sees a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens after the aston@@ ishing end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony .
&quot; this is once more : red @-@ green can easily be reliable , &quot; said CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the publishing network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fra@@ ction of a Green Repres@@ ent@@ atives has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the di@@ re @-@ election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its own votes against the opposition of CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green national manager Michael Kell@@ ner has asked for the subsi@@ dy lower Sax@@ on Green Dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ west to return to their mandate .
the Com@@ ing of the CDU is a clear fal@@ se@@ ance of v@@ oters .
El@@ ke T@@ ot must immediately return to its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and campaign for the Gre@@ ens of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; but all this can &apos;t be true , &quot; she sigh@@ ed a SPD election victory , when Friday afternoon , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Court , att@@ aches the party center .
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing over the CDU of the Li@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CDU without a government majority .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly marked defeat at the Saarland in March .
a blue eye , more not , the com@@ rades looked after .
after the regional elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it became even worse - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Tau@@ ride , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite sh@@ ook the party smoothly .
the com@@ rades settled down again in the weeks after lab@@ ori@@ ously .
then when she had sli@@ pped a new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with it came the next deep gul@@ f .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD state , lost its aura at that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because he was wrong with the crisis , so quite something that you can do is wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz is fighting for political survival .
so now Stephan Weil .
due to the VW exhaust and its role in the supervisory board , the lower sax@@ onian Prime Minister already stood in criticism for some time .
mi@@ ese det@@ en@@ ings were added .
anyway , or perhaps just so , because in the past weeks , because in the past weeks , he increasingly sought to set acc@@ ents in the Con@@ federation .
the ende@@ av@@ our of the former civil champion of Hanover , to expand its power in Berlin , was not hidden by Martin Schulz as well .
they let him grant him , because they refused to be a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
but then , in the part@@ akers of the party , he does not have any gu@@ ilt because of the part@@ isan kenn@@ els .
and Schulz does not have at all .
and the com@@ rades therefore try to keep their own ranks .
their wrath is directed at the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the be@@ tr@@ al par@@ liament@@ ar@@ isation in T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cr@@ ati@@ fying , as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests dis@@ appo@@ ints her own career on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editor of the German Editor ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ shel@@ ters is not responsible for their personality as a direct can@@ did@@ ly , but have been elected to parliament on the national list of the lower Sax@@ on parliament .
the logical consequence would be to give them back to its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary fra@@ ction , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the v@@ oters of the four years ago was clear : Stephan Weil passed to prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who leads the Lower Sax@@ on SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag and the ND .
&quot; now the personal career of a future CDU dep@@ u@@ ties for@@ ged the election results , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann again .
he ordered to clari@@ fy the background .
I want to know if there was more or it was given further approval of the CDU out of Lower Saxony .
F@@ ather@@ land for Ort@@ sk@@ ians III
those who want to re@@ post in the years will soon take support from the country .
additionally , Mayor of Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ste@@ ep@@ y urban development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of the previously known si@@ ze@@ able .
since 1991 it has been given in Emp@@ fingen restoration areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 the surplus was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and exclu@@ de just new construction regions .
on April 4 , one received the information from the Government of President Karlsruhe that will give it a me@@ aring @-@ area III .
the funding amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , including 500 000 Euro from the country , the remainder of the commune .
how is a san@@ ction coming ?
one will continue to investig@@ ate so sh@@ ing@@ ler , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are .
there is also a role , whether in the planned area of general notice of interest , to renov@@ ate .
if necessary , the territ@@ orial borders may also be moved again .
the jet@@ ty came on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the content of the federal state @-@ country @-@ program &quot; Social city , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out then .
the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of interior cities , improving the living space conditions and maintenance and development of the infrastructure .
the measures would be objec@@ t@@ related , that is conducted per plot .
the renovation area would then be defined as a constitution .
the approval period for the funding period exp@@ ires on 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the stock preparation would only be carried out , within the scope of which involved a question@@ naire to fill out a question@@ naire .
in November or December , the submission order should be made possible , so that year will be started with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
after that , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that each Commun@@ e would carry out regulatory inquiries .
it comes to evaluate and decide the urban w@@ ast@@ ings , and decide when san@@ gu@@ ed and in what circum@@ ference is .
there will be also a focus on the property in the book .
pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come once again to Emp@@ fingen and become a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project was the participation of the parties concerned .
therefore , there will be question@@ n@@ aires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks , and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow question@@ naire is the &quot; building and plot sheet , &quot; which manages the structural condition and restoration .
the gray question@@ naire , the &quot; household and housing design , &quot; can be made up to size , distribution and residents of a residential area .
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; can only be completed when the building is operated in the building .
however , God pointed out to be aware that a solid question@@ naire is not at the same time an application for funding .
new construction are also not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding from the medi@@ ator principle after &quot; gre@@ y@@ hound @-@ principle - who first comes first , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
no funding could be reserved for later . &quot;
at the end , more photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ians II &quot; were shown to make the present a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot;
British inventor itself sets a micro@@ chip to come with a movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a movement .
Steven Nor@@ tham , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals that simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , an advis@@ ory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ists in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant@@ ation procedure is performed after medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
Mr. Nor@@ tham &apos;s company wants to rev@@ ise the locks on houses and cars , so that they are compatible with chip , at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one now has installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House , a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn in the last month , will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers to the TIM@@ E magazine which had been handed over to the TIM@@ E magazine for up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products of all 50 states .
a helicopter built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was a yacht out of Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin , and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter shown on the South La@@ wn , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn on the occasion of the event , and so long until the grass had been vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
the note adds , if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service , a second team would need for the return flight .
during the event , the original flight was used during the event , while security guards remained at the ground during the time on the plane .
out of the recordings provided at the TIM@@ E were not clear , if a second flight is ultimately required .
the Brands Act shall forbi@@ d the federal state to use national property for political purposes .
record records indicate that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could harm the outcome .
&quot; a question that we were asked whether it was a violation of the Brands Hatch , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; he wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Brands Act .
but official events have political tones .
at the event , the President grants an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to increase governmental reform .
the use of aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One is , from politically neutral purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use is only for a photo @-@ OP , is un@@ common .
in February , Tr@@ ump led an investigation into the background of his first camp@@ ag@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of messages which compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is impressed by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Chairman of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the region around Washington and in South La@@ wn by susp@@ end US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ ers@@ .
as a tr@@ ump in early July on the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings at the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was one of the training requirements for the month , said an official .
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours to the Day for Non @-@ Presi@@ dency Supp@@ orters . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers had been the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in creating a helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain a budget record for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event .
according to St@@ un@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement is set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D 24.@@ 380 USD per ticket .
recordings of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for compensation is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are contained in the annual funds . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the funds set for Do@@ D do not include staff expenses , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance , and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former White House , Sean Sp@@ ades , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ada .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on this .
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is reasonable to highlight it . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting as a helicopter above the South La@@ wn in the event , but he sat in the drivers seat of a fire@@ man car .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives from S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and was jo@@ king over his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
leading riders in the Second Tennis Bundesliga match the S@@ V table col@@ der .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Su@@ z@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite five games still mak@@ ec@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance , the top leader of the second tennis league has won the sense of reality .
team leader Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has at least respect for the opponent .
&quot; it is a compact team that always plays like a similar formation .
right on the back positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V lake dor@@ fer , imports from the high North .
&quot; their D@@ warf and Finn@@ s can even point to reference to the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ sex@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this will be difficult for us as always .
you also need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white might give maxim@@ e jan@@ vier .
at the moment , the winner of the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella Club does not only come to the Bundesliga match in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c player Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) during his first deployment in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White @-@ Prussia An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was in Kiel but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ owed , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on Sunday last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster also Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could back into the team .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , is not filling out from the train@@ ers by Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay to the cad@@ res .
how America of OMV can harm
indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he put his signature under the law of the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in its H@@ ast , to let the Law let the Congress a few &apos; constitutional judgments &quot; applied , he was et@@ ched .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US army .
after all , the design is fore@@ seen to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build g@@ asp@@ ip@@ el@@ ines into the EU .
correspon@@ d@@ ingly , investors of the native OMV , which co @-@ financed with other European firms , is co @-@ financed to the construction of the Russian East @-@ sou@@ l@@ ation Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is tremendous .
nevertheless , it was too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , as the official statement of the oil company .
actually , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions on an executive order .
he is twelve guns with him .
the press &quot; has seen itself , which the group could off , and which could really hurt him .
sc@@ orn Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Car@@ tel is placed in the core of the he@@ y@@ line of Net@@ fli@@ x .
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer has been revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x hasn &apos;t been reviewed yet .
the relay three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first got its first trailer and showed the latest ar@@ se@@ wi@@ ches of the show .
with the third season , D@@ EA has paid attention to the richest organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i car@@ tel .
led by four powerful agents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company , &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the head of the cart@@ els , Miguel Rodri@@ guez pleaded their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican association , and Che@@ pe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York .

scroll backwards : the town provides 46 ch@@ efs
the town organizes the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to team .
in the urban nur@@ ser@@ y premises the clock is turned back .
on September 1st the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supplies in the urban nur@@ ser@@ y equipment ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , this is good news : &quot; we were all pleased . &quot;
cooked continues to leave home : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh sn@@ aking .
the city operates in the area of 46 nur@@ ser@@ y places , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
in the last kit@@ ten year 2800 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; by now eating only children who are cared for about 45 hours , in the cas@@ ita of lunch , explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay up to 14 : 00 . &quot;
46 . from the 1st of September , kitchen service : warm up the delivered food , add salad , raw vegetables and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , place the food off , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workers are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ eng@@ aging facilities - decides about the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied .
&quot; so they are much more active and easier to implement , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts is easier for the cure . &quot;
because that &apos;s why it works : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children will help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ power team should be meaningful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also task of ch@@ urch@@ yard ju@@ ices - will in future be completed by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of cooking in the kitchen capacity and the char@@ ms that they find themselves in cost equal to the city as the most economical solution , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 particles are re @-@ hired .
&quot; but these hours fall at all around 750 persons in the gu@@ ardian area not so strongly to the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative , if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , acting head of the UN mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ o@@ unded in the provinces . three women can@@ o@@ dict the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered v@@ oters .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
choices can only be more representative and belie@@ vable when women participate actively and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a election process which co@@ inci@@ de with the transition of international combat missions to an advis@@ ory role .
this year the elections for the first time will be rendered peace@@ fully from a demo@@ cr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will not support the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent elec@@ toral commission exam@@ ines that 1.2 million women from a total of registered 3.6 million v@@ oters were registered .

men try to cut 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men at the age of 19 and 23 are supposed to have tried to spoil a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to informations of the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stopped with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , around 14.@@ 55 , because they wanted to telephone with the phone of the girl .

G@@ MB concern on investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
among managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie adv@@ ances in its long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has shar@@ pen@@ ed about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ ard site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant working beside other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea B@@ ills .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said that in recent years he invested more than 5 million pounds .
he added that employee and trade union &quot; would experience as the first thing , &quot; if their activities were to change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ qu@@ iter &apos;s company , G@@ MB Scotland demanded &quot; &quot; concern &quot; that funding will not be promoted to moderni@@ zation of production lines . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organiz@@ ers Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can not gain clarity about the needs of the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concern our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate greatly on the local community and the large area of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in a territory with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ ageous ones .
hence , under the prosp@@ ect of employment , wage and prosperity , and in the background of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing cost of life and of the chronic production process , the Eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently needed a flor@@ atory production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ iter &quot; said : &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ iter &quot; received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and the company will respond directly to them as we appreciated continuous commitment in employees and trade union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with our staff that , like all the companies working in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , our business will constantly check - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross country , particularly in production lines and operating improvements .
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and quite an . should our operations change at the location , the staff and their union representatives shall be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years prior to Ne@@ y@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not indul@@ ge in its persecution of Ne@@ y@@ mar , after spending an offer of € 189 million in order to trigger his free @-@ bye clause , but before three years ago , they have warned of the world record prior to the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million .
after the completion , Ne@@ y@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid Professional sports@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is li@@ vid over the way , as Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way out to the outside , although a fountain was given its best in order to take care of him since his coming from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for everyone who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried as they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to draw one of our players logging in , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest at the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to leave the International from Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing any of their prices for Ne@@ y@@ mar .
sco@@ oters turned and damaged
in the night of Friday to Saturday , an unknown t@@ aut has thrown off the sco@@ oters road before the property number 30 , and so on the covering of vehicle non @-@ damage of over 200 euros is charged .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints .
the police searches for an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car came out on his road , the driver had to leave a VW Tour@@ an and touch@@ é the guard .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was going to arrive at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of Stol@@ zen@@ au we met him a passenger car on his driving lane , so that he had to escape to the right .
the Tour@@ an drivers had the control plan at the touch@@ screen .
Sach@@ alin arose at the passenger car .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had passed a truck and continued to worry about the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it may well be good that the mer@@ c@@ ed@@ cer had not noticed an accident .
the police now asks witnesses of the incident and the driver of the caus@@ al plane to get in touch with the tra@@ ine@@ eship in Stol@@ zen@@ au under tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ spar@@ row report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row report presents the mis@@ use of Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on the failure of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row continues to provide discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ler , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained by the former Rain@@ s@@ burg Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger all would express its deepest sub@@ missions or her back false evaluation of the operations .
the Vatican Council of &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand , however , critic@@ ized that in the reporting of violence in the spar@@ row with &quot; two measure &quot; was measured .
in regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to prevent &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions . &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and preparing the public opinion to maintain normal for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
also , the interview for Th@@ urn und Taxis played an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we would like to go to the Church and that &apos;s a perfect fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not fair to use standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse were often referred to as Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
completely wrong , the author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who was translated with R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; My brother , &quot; written in 12 languages .
&quot; I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the dioc@@ ese in Regensburg with the en@@ lighten@@ ment of Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 colonies were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ ums &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ spar@@ row sexual abuse .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 until 1994 : &quot; summar@@ izing , so we have been employed in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ alisation the punishment for the pupils could also be more intense .
however , in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims were killed by R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are combined with him . &quot;
in the interview , H@@ es@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Milan Dom@@ spar@@ row , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and his opinion , were reli@@ eved .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report about the &quot; occur@@ ren@@ ces of violence @-@ violence against women slaugh@@ tered in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row , exists a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one , many students take up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as a chol@@ era and perfec@@ tion@@ ist used for the latter , when a domain kit made no top performance .
how do you compare this final report ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when you read the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
he has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly under suspic@@ ion of every suspected of middle or co @-@ union with the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also , the geography texts at the pre@@ school took place outside of his sphere of residence .
it is possible to disc@@ ard him too late or having taken the first incen@@ tives not to be taken seriously .
the Dom@@ as@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ u , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all inter@@ ro@@ dents - as literally - &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus also the broad majority of its students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also expresses it as &quot; warm@@ heart@@ ed &quot; , &quot; popular , &quot; sin@@ c@@ ere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; intel@@ li@@ gible teacher , &quot; who provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always re@@ located by hand of grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ying about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his highly Emot@@ ional Emot@@ ional , which also led to rage .
that he threw it not only with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground , but also he also appe@@ aled to the hair , but also listened to him many years ago , and he ap@@ ologi@@ zed and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
it has to be said to his hon@@ esty , however , that such education methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , widespread with parents as for teachers .
do you have still know such kind of breeding methods ?
of course , I think everybody was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared to what it actually goes in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the food @-@ texts at the pre@@ school , are the liber@@ ate excav@@ ators .
so you ask yourself if it is not to do with his not@@ ori@@ ety and role as a brother by Benedi@@ ct XVI , that a lot of media over@@ threw herself .
on the Bavarian Bishop so many who have never understood him , still eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row have been reported in the media .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also put some processing or con@@ ju@@ ction with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entru@@ sted to the Dom@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or mother about it , &quot; said a man @-@ man representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot;
the real problem with the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims turn from sc@@ am .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , it certainly not a chor@@ us who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Qu@@ atz@@ inger students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student still formulated this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no fall in which he had had the findings in which he could have had been arrested ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and the relevant offen@@ ders could have been arrested .
I think it ... also for a really absurd to accept that ... Bub@@ bles put in urgent or more clearly , as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ guides , confidence teachers , etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
thus the report belongs to the very clear result : &quot; that in the ap@@ op@@ ac@@ tly affected pupils and / or their surrounding areas , the report could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free of everyone .
thus cannot it be cast out , it cannot be prevented or brought to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to get its good name with these contra@@ dic@@ tory crimes , as it sadly happened in some cases .
in the media a lot of &quot; Ge@@ wal@@ ly@@ c@@ ence &quot; was to be read by the Regen@@ s@@ bur@@ atzen .
the former dom@@ en@@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown into the &quot; Weg@@ ner &quot; report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that we mixed everything in the reporting and men@@ tions a huge milking from sexual abuse and mit@@ wal@@ ly@@ sis and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is just a mis@@ use of the report .
because it is clean separated : between the pre@@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other alle@@ g@@ ations .
in addition , the report prevents inci@@ dents from time since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger does not have choir director .
all the horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys from sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were wi@@ dened and mal@@ igned , all took place on the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where real sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have ruled .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister George R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only too face when they were already on the Dom@@ ot@@ er@@ og@@ col@@ mn@@ ay .
on that , just like most witnesses , the subject of &quot; Vor@@ werk , &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ ot@@ av@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ ay ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was a real discipline , but there is no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report is coming to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were in@@ valuable to the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases will even bind positive memories of him . &quot;
at most this remains the repro@@ ach to have looked .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he reported from the conditions on pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was in charge of the predec@@ ess@@ ors at a school , where he was not working and responsible , ( so witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 .
do Georg R@@ atz@@ inger f@@ lowed in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , for in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ ot@@ av@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium who also re@@ produces the report .
in it , he pointed out this to be pract@@ ised in the prepar@@ atory process . &quot;
as a result of the danger of negative public@@ ity , he recommended to interven@@ e .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity as a test was forbidden also in Bavaria .
before that , she took place in a legal gray area , just as everybody knows of us .
it was hard to estimate that , where those concerned may be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised , and where truly the permitted limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say , he had always looked away .
it &apos;s just not right .
only in 1980 , the test sentence of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
princip@@ ality in Gloria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said it was un@@ fair to use today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards the times of that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we histor@@ ians speak as of &quot; tra@@ jec@@ tions of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , the past , according to present moral affairs .
of course the princess has quite right .
but this is not true of sexual abuse , which was ab@@ om@@ in@@ able at all times , and also not for what is broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence at innocent children &apos;s schools , that goes far beyond the way .
that is all very dre@@ ad@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and punishment , so Tinnitus and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , it has also strictly taken hold of it .
what picture of his time in his time is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; in the interviews ?
did the subject of Prü@@ m as well come to language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XV@@ I. , at his perspective , they just played a minor part .
nevertheless , I do not necessarily mean that he led a strict regime there .
but even this must be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form the national cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition from the until then twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone one does not make any big singer and stand out of any success in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcome .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for their talks with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and was over again a wonderful , hum@@ orous and heart@@ y , deep @-@ belie@@ ving , deeply belie@@ ving and heart@@ y people who could not imagine that he could do something in a fly .
I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows are still living , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him to read it - he is almost blind and treat him as a member of their family .
those who cannot forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him today that he en@@ riches her life and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a strict father , certainly I might be - but also a lo@@ vable respect to which they are still looking up and honor them .
and please , once again clearly : all that is acc@@ ented to him are gu@@ ardian methods that were then on the agenda .
we can be happy that we have long ago long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a still prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin@@ i@@ be@@ x .
then the evil intent that stands behind it , is only too obvious .
because the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves it .
now the approach was to have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without Germany &apos;s outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one could know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row in peace .
