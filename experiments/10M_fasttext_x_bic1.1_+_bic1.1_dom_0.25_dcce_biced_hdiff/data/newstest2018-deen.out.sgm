<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where young people will meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftkapelle, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is dug up.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners inhibits the former bottom of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card mouths encourages exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to exugh himself, because the car Navi took place in a green lawn instead of a walk-up road.</seg>
<seg id="8">Historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are anything but currently quite illuminating.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">It will then be clear how towns and communities have changed the scope of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a flicker carpet, which one does not realise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great coverage map for cities and communities more detailed maps, so-called judging sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were produced according to the Bavarian State Investigation between 1810 and 1864 and borrowed the first surveying Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the fall of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had received an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801 at the end: there were today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria-card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian State Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="19">The primary data sheet of Munich originates from the year 1856 and is available as any other on the Bayerisches Land website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison to early / day is the most impressive of the country's capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is sub-sendedling, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, in 1877, when Munich area was founded.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today is the middle of the city in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses were concentrated in 1856 along the Plinganserstraße that was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the west park is, one sees no more than fields - at first sight: a smaller-part map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten flurpieces from the so-called "urine" which has been derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots spread over there no farmers more - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is drawn from the north of the subsendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 was the place of the Oktoberfest in the 19th century, was actually a meadow and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the background of the area Au-Haidhausen in the area of the area Au-Haidhausen, one does not only read the road name "on the air pastry" or from the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield Road one once locked people with incredible shots.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59, the Munich-Irrenanstalt was founded "On the Auer air."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the establishment of that psychiatrist, who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the purchase of the so-called Irish.</seg>
<seg id="36">He has also forbidden the personnel to make violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum of Haidhausen, who deals for an exhibition with Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, initially a place was extended, later was expanded to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity did not give up more - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people are now meeting in the Salesian Salesians in the area of former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order gained the building complex in 1920 and converted it to a Youth house with vocational training.</seg>
<seg id="42">The west location of the TSV München Ost, east of East residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">The children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in 2015 - based on an architectural heritage of the Irrenanstalt which was destroyed during the World War II by bombing.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was registered as a "main place" in 1856, the department name was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change provided the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombings had many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - on the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institut, small business buildings and a group chapel from the Middle Ages were once on the Marienhof, where these days work and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn order is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich map with the slider can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil association publishes Travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colored has issued a warning for coloured people who travel due to discriminant policy and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, who will come into force by August 28, 2017, is to bring special attention to the state, because a number of questionable, racial-based prevention will occur in the whole state and reported here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to win discriminators, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionately to minorities, caused the group to release their warnings, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"you have injuries of civil rights, which happen to humans.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be stopped because of their skin color, they are joined or killed, "said the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear problems in such a frequency which we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The reported incidents such as racist violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under unquestionable circumstances in the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during his journey through the state and accused by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the offices of the Attorney General of Missouri, in which black drivers in the state will be more common in the state 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees tell about what happened in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring their money, or to know the relatives that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri experienced a year in 2015, after the latest figures from the Hassilcrime Programme of the FBI, who recalls the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to sue a company for employment or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) travel warnings issued for Texas and Arizona, after the United States adopted immigration authorities to ban people because of migratory failures, which will contribute to further breeding rules in the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually exhibited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately they have employed the action as response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Turndeception project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The ffence project's ffence project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU of the German parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on-site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the spacy of the Schwendemann family, the representative of the fisherman's parliament together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann commutes into his farm into his farm where he is cultivated in 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens.</seg>
<seg id="72">For him, the Black Forest of milk is the alternative distributor trail for the milk of its cows, so jib.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of guests only Regionals.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also a "elementary project" which is also important as a "elementary school" in Fisbach, he also called "elementary project."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area is working for a lot of work, to be edited with the sense sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we struggled with the conditions and to fight with topography," emphasised Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and manage these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead to a biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the Leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">With a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare would have to be supported by farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hopeful that, for a while, the afforestation of surfaces could be moved out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often represented in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 parcels were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The retention area is therefore 40 hectares, which cannot be reconstructed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half of the Leader is promoted, a quarter owed to the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers stay 12 billion euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained ydemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job without farmers and farmers do not work."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White got firm: "best food will be produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The national park fledge line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state subsiding of pasture.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Schwarzwald's shift.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of a subsidies recorded by the LPR is a prerequisite.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area must not be bad (hanger by 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the reafforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight attendees with 24 plots, which aim to build up about 16 kilometres of fence for the fadversary project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump bears the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack the statues instead.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans just appreciate these as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall Saddam Hussein's place at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-Regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals by the President to the drastic restriction of legal Immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To keep fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A Horde of boaters and Liberty imitation have he suffered him, if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he seized the meaning, and in particular the importance of her was entrusted to her as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, who was built 17 years after the completion of the monument to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller's Acosta said: "I don't want to go down a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem is based on which you have been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">It lies appropriately, but how he formulated it, does not really go about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemportive words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only recharges an old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "your mosquitoes, your poor, and your troubled masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the afflicted falling of thy rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "saving waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trump United States.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: in fact, a conflict is about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who were interested in placing their words after their death - knew very well that they had done a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American publicans, showing them in an unused classical visual representation of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no more abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she has a different name for himself: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem by the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change their right wing from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty came to the Statue of Liberty, but rather an early neo-conservative daily that raises the American flame into the world: "Lady Liberty is preceded.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not shine through the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">It was quite unusual at Limbaugh here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is wholly and a question of standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great fanciful act was by Lazarus in order to see how they drew from the, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense that the world comes from a perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue refers to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective of Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine through the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black looses Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when only two Sans belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of world champion is a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the Athletics of the United Kingdom had to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to continue until we find out," Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I am speaking with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics Men: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals giants, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was made a team captain from the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes whether they were Scottish, or where they live or train, went out of the room and felt very motivated and were highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought quite naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth world championships with 400-m hurdles, says it's unbelievable, that 16 scoots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes during World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">This path bends left out five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m running, is another Scotsman who was to watch the victory at the British team of Trieste and the Anniversary Games after a great season.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman at the team Lee McConnell.</seg>

<seg id="151">"what makes a special team for the team to be so that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it anyway was a great honour to know that my team-mates voted for me and voted for something special to me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to go on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What does my speech affect as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think they went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block Critics on Facebook: do not apply to a public office if you can't fuel the fuel of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of the internal policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shrink with criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For in the year 1783, Washington said, "The Redefences can be removed - and, dumb and mute we will be led like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans members have blocked the contributions from at least 450 people and deleted their opinions published on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union failed to revise it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Bar-governors dismissed the complaint as frivol- and the online commentary was full of a counter response with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in a stunning democratic state which is astonishing popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest vote of the 50 governors in the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitler head.</seg>
<seg id="176">It has shown fixed hand on the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a priority means to connect with his voters and end his hailed head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of people who come to the site of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is considered officially and from employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defending Hogans Specherin Amelia Chasse, the actions of the governor and argued that the blockings of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trollables or spammers or passerted people, which vibrate online the lashes.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail talked with some of the real people who have been blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And they are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans in Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not hassle, but she asked for Hassverrupt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other latest news," wrote it in the commentary volume of the message "The Post."</seg>

<seg id="188">What the employees of the governors described as "concentrated spam-attack," others might probably call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or delete a negative comment.</seg>

<seg id="191">But exactly this just happened.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who criticises that he has vaccinated Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users, which were blocked by his Twitter feeds.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question happened last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County announced the first amendment, according to U.S. Ambassador James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she named a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU because of its use on Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be that hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers killed between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefing stood on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And Washington had anonymous trolls at that time.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used Pseudonyme as "Juricola", "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters of newspapers who repented Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who also criticised his position on the contract of Amity, trade, and navigation with Britain, has overcome his office, according to historical documents which were collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and discourses belong to our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="407">A survey conducted under air passcodes showed that more than 20 percent of goods are swisely or unaware of the checkpoints of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, such as at least 6 percent of which entered the aircraft, while they have accidentally forbidden knife or other objects with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent believed they had discovered that they were irritable with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey among more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a Jet CharterService, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., was also established that younger travellers are rather disregarded the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of those surveyed, they gave evidence that they have been trying to fly with something that was banned from the TSA, were 19.7 percent of millennials compared to less than 15 percent, who were members of the generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items, which were deliberately prepared for TSA agents, were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent prompted to have certain items carried by security during security control, while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of male respondents have also confirmed that they have taken intentionally faded drugs to the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it had questioned travelers in the whole country in order to find out how many accidgling smugware encouraged by the airport security and how many would have seen it intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who wear the heaviest smuggling - knowingly or uncertain - due to safety, those who are most often flying.</seg>
<seg id="415">However, the company indicates that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often uncertain that liquids may take them away or how much of it.</seg>
<seg id="417">Therefore, it is no surprise that the largest amount of ordinary items of the TSA are forbidden.</seg>

<seg id="420">Elon Musk doesn't matter: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel stock</seg>
<seg id="421">With the huge number of orders for his new Tesla "Model 3, he is giving a huge number of pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="422">So far, it has undergone that some of the clients have withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the always triumphant figures, Tesla boss Elon Musk has shown another, less glacious number for the first time, with the announcement of the recent Quarterly balance: cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Musk had often advertised with the more than 500,000 orders for the new car in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk is coming: from the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always indicated that it is merely indicative for reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 U.S. dollar and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment" completely back.</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 455,000 of such non-retail reservations before, divided Musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation from date to date may be about twelve percent of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="430">Its own argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets does not lie in demand but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year Tesla created 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">All models are to be put together in 2018 - 500,000 being one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 free reservations are now available.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who today ordered a "Model 3" from the second half of 2018, should be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018, if Tesla manages to transfer his brand new, never in practice tested production lines with maximum load of load.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if it comes to larger delays, then the integrity of the reservations should be Tesla's problems.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then, the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from entering in droves.</seg>

<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruten decided that his reversal is at ozone standard very simply to meet the willingness of EPA in cooperation with the United States through the complex process of delaying the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"in earlier administration, the EPA often has often kept the deadlines for carrying out and then waited on the deadline for performing, and then agreed in an agreement with the deadline for performing tests," said Pruitt, who defendants EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"we do not believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take times seriously.</seg>
<seg id="452">We also take the law and authority that giveth us seriously. "</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA said that somehow materialized his "reliance on the delay and all other legally available authority," to ensure that the regulations "on a solid policy and the best available information are based."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in the Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive upgrading of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A legislative draft approval of the rules of 2015 should be delayed by at least eight years in the last month of the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not set to vote in the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years St. Hilarius-church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the church church, the old cemetery-area will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 16.30.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hilarius plant a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can enchant themselves from this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and supporters of tumours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique little treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Wuerttemberg priot book: count Hermann von Sulz copied "the hill with the inctive parish church to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark of silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The wording of the document was based on the rough mountain apart from the former parish church, but also a marvellous court, which belonged to the church or the patron right and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are now in the outskirts of Tumlingen by now, the "mountain" is the third, the magnificent settlements of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from time around the year 1600 probably underestimate that historical events.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patron is originated from the early medieval aptitude.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built up a church and occupied with a pastor, continued to be owner of this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thereby, the right to deploy a pastor or the bishop to present a new pastor.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones were celebrated at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly introduced bell was the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during World War II in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were staked and the bellows were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius were also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower had been left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's year 1834, a storm formed the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower existing today has remained as a witness of the 750 years-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wallenger of the "Schaffner retires" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers invite the friends and supporters of tumour on Sunday, July 16th, the sixth serenade onto the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is made by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The village of Hartmut Romanann is speaking the preface.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="498">Intake is from 15.30 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the passage of the Serenade there is a trunk of the cemetery instead of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening below the shade of old trees and with wide view over meadows to forest," the organizers put out fantastic views.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade will only take place in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope to support many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tumult and auditors.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumlingens are particularly committed to home maintain, like Serenade-organizers Walter Martini.</seg>

<seg id="505">"Boisheim continues" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and is directed toward the councils.</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim" has prompted "Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back its authorization for the construction of planned wind turbines in the floor area Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association is argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been authorised, as at the time in Viersen, a wind force concentration camp existed only at the time in Viersen at the time in Viersen.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines is possible, at the same time, the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the town.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the town had already decided to change the vial action plan for a second wind turbine zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but it had not been approved by the Düsseldorf District Court because of its formers.</seg>
<seg id="512">"the applicant's lack of approval is due to the lack of approval of approval from the lack of planned regulatory approvals," said Christopher Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: the city council has decided before the summer break once again the wind concentering zone in the area of Boiseimer Nette; a authorization of the district government is still standing.</seg>
<seg id="514">Kens: "this is the foundation of obtaining permission for the creation of wind energy plants according to plan."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding writings have been made in the circle for last week," explained a spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle makes it a reason to try again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With a view of ongoing trial at the administrative court, the circle on Thursday didn't want to express itself on the argument of the association "Boisheim."</seg>

<seg id="522">With the establishment of four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered from roughly 11 400 households, which equates to roughly one-fifth of all four-seers households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens City entered the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinberg district.</seg>

<seg id="864">In the Erzgebirge the triple chain is also further optimised.</seg>
<seg id="865">And a gate after a free shoot, the barns also don't want to catch.</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future it will be so that no one is standing next to Michael (Rensing)."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team has better rigging even after the experience in preparation with the spin chain better than with the four-chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still don't know how to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure to have that right in the triple chain in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well, "said Hoffmann.</seg>

<seg id="870">Of course Hoffmann is also travelling to Aue to win the game.</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you cannot speak after a deciduous start, I don't know.</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can start the season quasi with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that players from Aue might even have something fresh as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna to get a rise in the bone as Fortuna.</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing," says the defender of the Fortuna.</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for forensic medicine (riptile intranket) has started with the performance of tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should make the estimation of age more accurate during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migrational Authority (Migrationsdepket) has been criticised by several refugees in judging the correct age of some refugees.</seg>
<seg id="887">Up to now, Migrational Mediket 6.880 has been sent to testifying cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,481 testing from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) was judged as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency shared that the person was "probably 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, results are stable during the past months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged more than 18 years does not mean that the asylum seekers has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the Agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the submission person was 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet out the 581 results found that in 243 of these cases the person had been openly told that she will be 18 years old this year.</seg>

<seg id="899">To judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">If we cannot tell it sure we should not do it as if we could say, "he said the newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson, of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general you can say that the risk of taking a child as an adult is poor.</seg>
<seg id="902">The biggest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case, this is approximately 10 percent. "</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of the football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent unhindered issues of European football matches will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain, because the guiding organisation, which has supervised the European game, has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play rules, which were created in 2011 by the UEFA Champions League, mean that PSG has to point out at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without great losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can easily make the money loose, that Neymar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the energy rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Users may waste a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must act with legitimate entry of income that will allow them the break-even point in their football related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini in 2007 following his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player thought that Vereine that had enormous debts in their quest for success had to be effectively cheating and risked, when banks or owners have withdrawn their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP was attributable to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich, originally bought in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">Clubs in the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency of the Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA-successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to put off in excess expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will step up the rules for the future," said Andrea Horverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, allowing the sales revenue for the next five years amounting to 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 is the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG got a fine of 60 million Euros (then 82 million dollars), which later dropped to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players, otherwise normal 25 players remain limited.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to solidify their financial markets by combining their money by companies that are linked to owners of a clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could be responsible for PSG, if the value of the sponsor should exceed the default value, the UEFA does not apply this as a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA chose that the value of the sponsors of the Qatar was held by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar will be published by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have acknowledged that Neymar WM-ambassadors will be an effort to find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulator.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda war - a murderer who is wearing a Reagan Mask - often plays like a single raagan mask.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, the comedy is gone, and the comedy isn't fast or frequently enough.</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates by 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have damped the speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth "sluggish" will remain in the middle of a intensifying pressure in the middle of a intensifying print.</seg>
<seg id="1265">In this month, the Bank's political decision makers (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to ensure the interest rates of 0.25%, in this month less members reach a rise, because the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly effect for 2017, the Bank reduced its growth prognosis for 2017 to 1.7% and expected that the pressure in the household income would continue to rise to just under 3% in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But they signalled that in the next few years, interest-caves were needed to stimulate the inflation of the Brexit and told that the loan would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members voted to withdraw a part of the Mammut business package that was issued a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It is demanding time for the financing plan to provide cheap funding for banks since the coming February, although it is expected that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - at 115 billion sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank: "in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in short term, because pressure on the realities will continue to load the consumption."</seg>

<seg id="1272">Markets currently foresee the first increase in the third quarter of the year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">However, the Bank emphasized that increases "step" and "limited" would occur.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Following the growth prognosis of the Bank for this and next year, the Bank forecast for this and next year is 1.9% and 1,7% forecast in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth prognosis to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell to these messages across the dollar and the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pounds fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1,11 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change is due after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced the increasing expectations of an interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months has risen to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to easily recover from the Bank at the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1282">The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pounds, which is compensated by a proportion of lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision will take one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in August after the shocking EU vote caused the lowering of the pfunnel.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the last judgment of the Bank on the rate of interest rates, the call was increased after an interest rate, since inflation was increased to hard labour, with three policymakers in July having demanded an increase of 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id="1286">In the past month of 2.9%, inflation was dropped to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected to be put on in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The bank said, the crossing in relation to their goal of 2% may be "completely" to watch the weak pounds.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Andrew Montverdant, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "in view of the recent review of the swap rate, the mortgage market should again be competitive again, as the credit cards are looking for many shops and want to end the year in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1289">The market looks very well for those who finish the existing Deals and finish the new mortgages, and many with free options and low instalments are becoming more popular. "</seg>

<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that one prior to the sexual intercourse prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in risk-risk factors by about 86 percent, now comes from the health service over a first three-year study to estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court in which the NHS had assumed that the PrEP was able to pay the assertion that local authorities should finance him.</seg>
<seg id="1294">Announced on Thursday, NHS England Chief Simon Stevens announced as "major new intervention" during the National Aids Trust (NAT), which referred to as "crucial moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health related clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be one of the first to make registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced to England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preference processes (PrEP) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before having sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the HIV transmission for infections risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who come for the treatment of being are gay or bisexual men, transsexual and persons with HIV positive partners who were not successful.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable participants will identify the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals that have a partner whose HIV-status is not known through antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local sex hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of the medication this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the overall potential of PrEP comparing clinical evidence as it is used in a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should be the far reaching and increasingly successful efforts to keep HIV and overtake.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is a further milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity's biggest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive with NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "this is crucial in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">PrEP, if specifically aimed at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September on, people with high HIV risk access to this NHS-funded attempt in England will have to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many many lives.</seg>

<seg id="1319">It lies on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I showed this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>

<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been fully overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a sealed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to use Joanne Stauber and a mezzanine to optimal use the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, much light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she assigned the Design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to make the 12.5 foot raised high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to life for yoanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">You had to think creative to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is rather complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange rooms so arranged that they were stacked over each other, without leaving us.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not only about building a simple platform, but put the steel so that it had for the function up or down the right height. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">It paved the way for it to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper window of retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the reflection of the window will feel like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance are mirrored units square for all burners and glasses of jog.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By perception of a glamorous cateroom, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when she is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit engineering accomplishment went in," explains Erfan of steel reinforced, furniated MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it's mutual, so it's when you push the door, very easy glide."</seg>

<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million in real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate companies Victoria's worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors of his younger brother Paul, who has brought him to the Supreme Court to adopt the property, property and assets.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul did not want to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation with the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mom Anna, brothers 38 have accumulated in the value of more than half a billion dollars, and since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">The Westco jeans family established there and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to USD 85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">The money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bull and shopping centers in the suburb.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased, Colin - by Paul, as a "principal driver and the dominant personality," is described in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's wealth and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A place of jurisdiction proves that Colin owns the value of $316 million and it has valued at $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the Colin suggested articles have left him with him, which I kept for the best objects," he wrote in the first ape in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed attempts, the first Court of Justice took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for control over existing business - including Colin, how Paul claims to have been excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argued, this is not true, but Paul introduces Paul to manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early moridavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hoped to settle the argument.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage declares that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with monkey items, emails and charter companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides held bonds.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, the dairy bars and delikatessments from the late 1950-s and bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">You used the security to purchase the Collingwood personality, in Colin the first jeans shop opened the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started doing there, when he became "High School" in my last years, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old). "</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to disclose their property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land on trial," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other Brothers, Mark and Luke, are not part of the De Lutis group, Colin claims that Mark had paid $10 million in leaving the company $10 million and Luke 26 million.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke and Mark are, says Paul "has bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has kept very backward, although a former AFL board member was and following a biography from Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media received in touch with Colin and Paul De Lutis and her lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much," because the case is before the dishes.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it's very sad that my brother Paul chose to accuse me and draw our family name by the courts" he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father did not want Paul and I would end in our current quarrel," he said, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trump of new staff is planning to limit the media Abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico partner reports that the new staff of staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on an even course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, who met new staff of the White House, at his first working day with executive employee, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should - whether on paper or in writing - because the President would make better decisions if he would obtain good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to toss trump by overseeing its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship to television reaches decades now - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV shows are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if a candidate was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were persuaded," said the former campaign advisor to Sam Nunberg in February compared to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trump's Twitter habit is in control, according to six former campaign officers in it, ensuring that his personal media consumption involves a constant lobster."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump's Twitter-habit ever "was under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe this battle makers know something that we don't know that trumps Tweet would have been included without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets, which Trump does not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees have managed to keep away from him a few times, their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has systematically miseradicate that trump controle is strokes.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by promoting trump material that may help their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLICICO: quite busy with this history - reported in May on the preference of consultants, president of strategic reasons for dubious information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump as a volcano can react to negative press sections, especially such with damaged leaks, and that he stiff to find out where these come.</seg>
<seg id="1410">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter for chicans, or that he had no concrete evidence, or that he expressed false allegations in the past and revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly was trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove themselves as a priebus manager, but trump is still his impulsive self, and its counselors are still looking for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel is Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Those are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof estate by the then ambiance of operating company mbH to the 13th of April 2014, some 30 000 beds were lost per year and also proceeds through the local tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, a growing number of refugees, which arrived in the county, offered the hotel building to the governor along with a collective accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by placing a development plan to secure the area as a hotel site.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Fredenstadts Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at the age of serious difficulties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was supposed to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with CEO Birgit Scherer was acquired in Bad Bergzabern from a voluntary turnover in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of three-star Plus tier under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter building.</seg>

<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large wired showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything should be "beautiful bourgeois-up," which Thomas Scherer expresses.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a jewelry."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, spa area and a meeting room belong to the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">It would not be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lauterbath, but it is already emphasized from a higher downtown level.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 guest rooms will rise wide, explains Scherer.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: us special agent sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair with U.S. President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller should have chosen a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In the past weeks, the Committee recorded work, the "Wall Street Journal" written with appeal to people confidential.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper valuate the step as a sign, that Mueller expands its investigations and intensify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN station reported that in connection with a meeting between trumps and a Russian lawyer already in connection with a meeting between Trumps.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us Intelligence was accused of having mixed the Kremlin since longer, purposefully at the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were intersigns between trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are supposed to act as a consultant of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to a study, Mueller also increased more and more trumps of private and business environment under the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderkomer Trump placed himself personally in the centre and for the accusation that the President may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Lawys is to check and decide the evidence in possible failures and decide whether to be indicted.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Lawys are therefore also called imarkers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on, if it is about bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to charge people on behalf of Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, pre-invitations have already been shown to make the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian partner.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were called to be a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. were also trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his damalant campaign manager Paul Manafort in conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-experts told on Thursday evening in US television that the suspect show that Mueller does not leave himself in his work and that he if it should be necessary, quickly trade.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the enforcement of the abums is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new disclosure, President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to show out the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The issue give the Democrats an opportunity to feel "good, because they have nothing else that they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor to Ty Cobb stated in a statement, he did not know anything about the creation of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But they usually work in the salms, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House proscribed any actions which accelerated the work of the special-mediator to "faire" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI CEO James Comey has said three times that I won't be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to have changed that something changed, it was called in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rankings, accusations have been loud against Trump, who wants to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump led him to a attitude of investigations against the then national security advisors Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under big pressure for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That dissolved spectaculations about what Trump Mueller wants to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Different from the Congress of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair, to later back to President Richard Nixon, Mueller has found a position in which he could be fired theoretically on fines of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic transmitters, on Thursday, presented bills on Thursday, after which the agent can no longer be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg accelerates in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Arctic the giant iceberg has loosened by the almost seven times of Berlin from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar- and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 sq km large slap will run to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest glands that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people is not going out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To the extent of climate change has played a role in demolition of the iceberg, according to research information is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, in total, however, for around 30 years, a series of unusual interbursts in the region, writes the US Research Center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a background background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be linked to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The fractional Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow on the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this circle was the balance of waxes and disrupture some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfei is crumbling there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never gone back as much as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stand under tension and can disintegrate if a piece turns off at a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfei and iceberg does not increase sea level as it pushes the water on the water and flushes the ice so much water as it turns into the melt itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of petition leads, that the glacier directly flows into the sea and could drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only in a low extent, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest ski feather in Antarctica after AWI data.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the edge of the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, the front edge towards the free ocean is approx. 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>

<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers did not withdraw the demolition of this giant iceberg on climate change, so in recent decades many dowards are broken down in the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have been heated by around three degrees during the past 50 years and is taming to the areas where the temperature is fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants pets at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">As it becomes more difficult to occupy free places, the CDU, from the employer association organises to be more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">The Kreistag made 41 new jobs in the administration only shortly before the summer recess.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first working day behind.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are obviously very coveted.</seg>
<seg id="1556">About 620 applications were noted that this year had to be noted.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the circle still lack the staff to handle the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are currently 50 positions in the district in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things doctors and engineers as well as forces of the general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would now want to take the initiative in the Kreistag together with the FDP and the UWG into the administration building.</seg>
<seg id="1561">The administration should develop a concept for personnel production and personal development after the desire of the parties. "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The goal is to cover not only short-term Bedations, but to counteract-proof the candidate of application, says it.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside, concrete measures for cross-starter and include a training offensive, calling for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has something to do with staff problems you did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns present good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is of a regular "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">This involves a high number of employees who leave disease or age due to the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Tallest time for action, so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, leader of the CDU, continues with his party beyond their joint application.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy sharpened the tone to a NGO-migrants "rescue boat</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has NGOs that deploy rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warns that they may not continue to continue to comply with new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work on," said Home Affairs Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis alert came a day after the Italian authorities learned a boat from the German aid organisation "Youth Rettet" having effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that simplifies illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The aid organisation, which has only been in operation since a year, refused to express itself about extensive proposals from the Italian public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of the human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in a statement about social media.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can judge all the accusations currently being collected, since we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities gave the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, which has been monitoring since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew of dinghy migrants are delivered on board them directly from men's hands, and that the smugglers can drive, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was thought only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the nudes of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of observing as the authority of Italian coastguards, rescue attachments in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not supervised by any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Boats must be monitored under the Code of Conduct, such as the Iuventa, especially an Italian police officers, which monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue entries have so far been agreed to hold on the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activate Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessarily but acceptable, as they would not make any "essential changes or disability" of their rescue actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner doctors without borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti said by now that the number of migrants arrived to Italy in recent weeks, which resulted in the efforts to strengthen the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast-guards and cooperation with local citizens.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month, with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants attempting to reach those countries in the hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>

<seg id="1613">Sitting these Sports Stars in the future to sit through computer consoles, instead of fighting wind and weather for the stadium creek?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious sector, becoming a lucrative business - large stars, millions fans and huge tournaments with high scores included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal ligavers that are increasingly engaging in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">In early 2015, VfL Wolfsburg, followed by FC Schalke 04 and last followed by VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport company in mid-July and launched two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to amaze some new young target groups for the VfB," says the Managing Board of Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1618">He is sure, "on this move, several clubs are rising."</seg>
<seg id="1619">At the coming weekend, FIFA World Cup FIFA hosted the first "Interactive Club World Cup," in which Gamer organizes various clubs like each other.</seg>

<seg id="1624">And: the clubs attempting to capture all sorts of markets, especially the Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract you could be present much more often in these markets, than once a year the federal government to send to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">For E-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "DotA 2," "Counterstrike" or just hit football-simulation FIFA at the competition plane.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, like in ordinary sport, leagues have become well established in which the professionals can compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian games E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about the right sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is sure to get used.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froby has long dealt with the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the Professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne E-Sport is a sport because he's competent and many biological and physical reactions which can be found in the classic sport - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Besides, cognitive abilities need, a technical and tactic understanding and a quick response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only exercise in the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But strous also sees problems: "doping will always be a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic Sports are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Scientists emphasise the highly integrative effect of the E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are international on the way, this is like a big global family, since there are no intercultural inances.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the consulting firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts its growth in the E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly by advertising, sponsorship, and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Turnover has to be at 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of soccer league this is little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-Sport "is not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writing the deloitte consultant.</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are already many countries farther.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Large markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez will participate in the US Team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport Wagers University.</seg>

<seg id="1651">In the Netherlands and France, the football-first-league-clubs are under a loud order of Dutt's to set up an e-sport division.</seg>

<seg id="1653">Only to fall in nostalgia, and clarify the old times, is not enough anymore.</seg>
<seg id="1654">It is about to preserve the tradition of the club, but the company will set up the modern market at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digital world," commented also.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages her friend's friend and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, aged 20, will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed on parole.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was convicted of the death of Conrad Roy in June, having taken life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said Thursday at the hearing: "my family is inconsolable.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both it and Mr Roy had been involved in a mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="1669">In red trousers and a cream colored blouse, Carter, with tears in her eyes, stood with folded hands and down his eyes when she was condemned.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the Attorney at the Court.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"she finished his life to improve their own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">She has no responsibility, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="1673">"it has shown no repentance."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters attorney, it was a "awful circumstance, which she completely regretted."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their "age or reifegrad or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>

<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person, with whom I was together since my birth, is a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life with me," she said.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal tender, since there is no law in Massachusetts, who makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead in a carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention, after caretters reveal text notices that she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"Häng up, spring from a building, get yourself, I don't know, there are many ways, she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the eyes before his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad," and "All that you have to do is entering the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter searched carefully through the death of Roy and ordered that she would be able to take advantage of any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder of her British resident in Italy in 2007, was acquitted of her two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Mrs. Knox, Thirty Years old, released a Commentary in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender resulting in drought conditions due to drought in drought conditions and because of the intrageous insects falling down, which try scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, great headache.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence was effectively alarmed because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and in the fall much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has implications for the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cikade, a microbacterium that transfers the Zwergzikades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only lures for vacationers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "rather than having long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped, and either weakened or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered in consideration are a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce normally meet their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unceasing drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But this day, in the shadow of its own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, which were the aim of a attack with grenades, or at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They kindly ask the reporter to propose name for each column - no proof is necessary, perception and abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of brewhide that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no resting periods from violence, and while in the whole country the bodies accumulate, are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have taken his office in December 2012, there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is the publisher and her inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is perceived deeply, despite its presence exists - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his central finger with the word "Justice," is located on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties with Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts to show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although the Attorney General was set up in 2010, in order to process the cases by journalists, it was led to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely applied to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsoling and even though the terrain is even more verbal.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to turn my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the reason, we suspicions all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced out of his car and he was shot down for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - being translated with "twelve river".</seg>
<seg id="1830">The support ran out in his car and damaged it close by.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours would tend to fly in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the theme of Valdez, there are practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">After his arrest in the past year and the extradition in the United States in January was Sinaloa become one of the most terrifying battlesfields of the country, as rivaling factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not make anything that in Sinaloa any day or several people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of fledged, two-storey mausoleums that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">For a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state, with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February, the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalling cartellations in war with Guzmans's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication allows the sons to be angry every copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez for it, after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for his own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for north-protests in 2003 when he completed together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without breaking the robbery problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper rected a reputation for courageous and honest coverage, and increased turnover and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, difficult to publish investigations without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories, which nobody dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs history, wherever it was.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue to live," he said at the time of CPJ.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the job that falleth you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Feodoce-Team missed Valdez, the fun bird that could curse, like a dockworkers, was a teacher who had generously with hugs and rating, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always move to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for a routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also urged us to issue their own assumptions on how to do their job best, and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their hiding start and country runways," to move on drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-care and self-maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, The publisher of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then it happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no more - as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a gifty mix of lucrative carggers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce posed for safety training, there were suddenly no cell phones allowed. days earlier became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico have been used.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside the heat, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen which identified the Governor itself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where the drug abuse are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce blocked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It was the assassination of the brother of Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an excposé to state spending, which concentrated on the hometown of governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the district, guided by a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learnt from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician based on the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly all the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI-Governors were accused of corruption of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" guzman went into a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the reader was seen by the column of Valdez as the best known source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier, we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slim physistature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that are protesting against the murders of journalists, because the staff had become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez picks up a few signs and passed the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adamed vanished three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become as loudly as journalists in organized protests by the SOS Press "organised in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day, the director Bojorquez was gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa in the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to marry journalists and destroy them because they have told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked that she is again divided by the government, because she is worried that her rage has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were organized by organised crime officials and a comparable society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco Journalism" he wrote that Reporter may not only be killed by drugs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces, who were involved in organized crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">In the past year more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials reported more than half the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the morals have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macia in the northern state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed from the etas AF: "I am here because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphone lay beside her seperate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern State state Chihuahua, after the assassination of the Corsizeal Corn in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do such as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly presented the drug cartels with an editorial page on the title page "What do you want about us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are fled to their home countries or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and seek dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunting, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue working, it is a daily dance with risk-rich decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, indicates that the drug trafficking is terrified.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell and so I became writers," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight, last Friday when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat at the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, at once all their phones began to hum.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting stars with bandspas and security forces near the Mazatlan site had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">On the ground floor they have published the news on the website of Riodoce about your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirenen is close to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who stopped Wouache to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid of all, they didn't show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">The staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps under the huge portrait of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole Sinaloa.</seg>

<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used the camouflage to soak off his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, though a scary.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now, researchers have discovered that the first discoveries of an incredible rhino's work of an Canadian mountain work were so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even determine that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they could have had something from a "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report published in the journal "Current Biology" referred to him as "the mocked dinosaurs, who ever found it, and one of the best Dinosaurs" specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil remains a newly discovered type of nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved state has researchers who describe it as a "really remarkable", astrongly</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best known Fossil in its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, as he held on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met on something that fired on the surrounding rock out of the place, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 Pound (1,100 kg) heavy-clump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all of this hard work, the finished result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just btwinkle in the eyes, you might almost feel that it was sleeping," said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is going to go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa from the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant eater, even though it is covered with armor, is similar to a converting tanks, probably threatened by meats or dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from bootlegs, and used a paratroopic technique that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to blend better in his surroundings and to soften his enemies, experts say that it was threatened by many dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now exhibited in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7.000 hours in doing it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of presenting enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">She discovered the union, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shady is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is far beyond the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure was hunted by meat vorous dinosaurs, that the evolution was the increase in confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals, who deploy the counter-shady - think of roe deer, zebras or girdles - are much smaller and vulnerable as a prey, which indicates that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"powerful craftier behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs have been the crayon time," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows also that the skin of the dinosaur's bay was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists still investigate the animal on his life, including his conservative minigar to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and pushed out into the sea, where he sank back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South-flows today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is totally covered with conservative leaking skin, but remains in three dimensions and keeping the original shape of the animal." said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks almost as looks like in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much fantasy to reconstruct it. if you just shot a little with your eyes, you might almost feel that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, undressed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Even though the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists who seem to see their latest findings in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was diverted after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, then on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved Dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures had an average of 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed for up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch spikes, which raped from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was empowered by the western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaurs kept its armor in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin is still holded lined plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko on National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is such 'rare as a win in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the confusing is.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right foot is on his side, his five fingers are strapped up.</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), around 20 people had been violated on Thursday afternoon by a mass arbocharage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first data of the police, at 17.00 o'clock midside between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm nearly 30 cars, among them probably also trucks, interlinked together.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of injured were no details at first.</seg>
<seg id="1977">They handle light to moderate injuries, said a police-quiver.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A big range of lifevehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">A ten kilometres long rear stretch was formed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like a AZ reporter, it also came on the coaster track to massive disability - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade decomposed the license plates of the vehicle, which now have to calculate with sensitive strap.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 then a second accident occured on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">It was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced, nothing really is sitting on the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or it is engrossed in his work and just has a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: tail.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the Schaffner and wakes a soft or irritate the passenger from the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing a cartiless ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">One simply confirms the mobile phone that is taken and utilized by the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">A trial operation is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"the offer reaches, we extend it out.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It is likely to be available at many other traffic routes in Germany in the beginning of the year, "said a train speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the railways with no creative application.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use, however, some requirements have to be met: one needs a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You must also have bought it via the app by rail, DB Navigator, what is the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you go to the train, the ticket will call on "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">During the test customers, button on electronic application appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train conductor will receive a message on their mobile devices that Fahrgast X has taken on the train and took the booked seat for the Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train conductor with a ticket inspection at number Y he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can further sleep, keep on silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two benefits: one for the client, one for the train, which is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who would relax without ticket inspection through our train accompanying staff, check in the DB Navigator simply.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables passengers to design their travel time in their personal journey, "says Michael Peterson, marketing executive board of DB remote traffic.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the St. Louis born in St. Louis was born on the bed of an airbnb flat that she rented and scrollte through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a mail from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police has just killed an 18 year old child and still lies on the road," he was there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Puzzled, because nobody has posted the information on their feed, she joined Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was continually calling on its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black 18-year-old who was killed by a white cops in Ferguson, Mo., killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of browns lively bodies, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," said Ferrel.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was for them and their community nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She moved her mobile pfone, later on in the evening to tweet over people on Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos from the police station and the people that cried out, and of a man who claimed to be the father's father, who said a sign with the signature: "Fergusons Police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed with which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, secured an other policeman shotgun and shouted: "I will kill you all the animals."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," the Ferrell tends to their testimony.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder, which we have accustomed to us and we call it typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt shaking.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she repeated her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive on the next morning to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from October 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and the protest, the love and loss, of the strength and resistance of people who live in community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrel with her daughter wearing a caudal dress and a matching crown, she spoke to Ferguson, spoke the two of them talking about this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to struggle for what they have to believe?" reminded of what she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not correct.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take them, "said Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It needs to be aware of it and it will be drawn.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I was lucky enough to give her a experience, that she is personally no eklatent racism, it is no different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would prove bad service, they keep away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a village across the police station, which was led to a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to transmit them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to culturally shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my share vism has changed totally after the 9th of August," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health unevenness in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrel arrived at the evening demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Follow them, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to call "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question was made into my mind, "If you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently said in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson were not raised and raised their voices, and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Follow @ Fionawebeditor Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist known for his activism around Todefikt.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer to Ferrel, along with six other native people followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after being shot.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed, for so I will be portrayed."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelative lives, as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that it has to give a certain vulnerability to this work and for the creation of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history plays the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, having marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media in 2012, identify the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly struggling at different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must carry the heavy burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan insisted that "the movement is truly held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">But it is, however, that "this is not a affirmist type of action," which was chosen for the identity of their identity as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook up this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because with a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have disappeared long, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrel is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which it calls her home: "a mayhem."</seg>
<seg id="2083">She cloned herself at her singing and she feels oblivious to her memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discussing bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, even though it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the beginning of the pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponent.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold makes the subject hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Popular and Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">As the one bit to the bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Nicole Becker) or "This would be a dream" (Nicole Robots), comes from the other side: "does not need man" (Siggi Bing) or quite simply: "magnahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, including the rest of the remaining shops, fear the sucaries that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, in which the farmers market is on the market in which 13 direct suppliers will sell their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction will conclude with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a Markthalle in the new building - and for Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we've been buying almost weekly in the farm hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farmers always gladly.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would hope that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if it has to be marketed in a market hall in the gallery, the rental amounts to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But this should probably not be low with the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what purchasing positions in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothes, shoes, drugie- or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores are vacated here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not yet another weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is freshly made, mostly offered directly by producers and is an attractive price.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, cargo stores are rented in a shopping center just of larger companies, because the rent Miets are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions are almost no more and what is left of it, will probably also disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farmers market place during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or is it easy to drive out all shops from Bitburg as a bit before? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it's just not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a Shopping Center which stands empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmers market, it is thanks to the mad many - as I find - out-out projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market hall is made, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost invisibly - they hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tubeers and haircuts which were sent to you by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the cuttings from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year-old prison sentence after they publicly set Diplomatic messages about the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2nd August is called A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has been transformed into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and dissidering dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could look from Manning and made out of the 30 portraits which can be interpreted using these genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent Determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born by Bradley Edward, but has already been talking about identification as a woman since their puberty, was convicted by 20 accusations, including six violations of the spy Act, Computer and Theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that it gave only one photo - a grained, black-white self-lazy, sitting in the Manning obviously on a driver's seat and a platinblonde perig is associated with which it has been associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg has just returned from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forenical artifacts like cigarette muffle and chewing gum as extracted from the trash to produce a picture of what these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time they received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not attend this time and she could not take pictures, so they took touch with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse were written to uneven letters, which during two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," which had predicted a future in which the President Chelcizing would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama indeed had only a few days after the book was released, Manni was forced to call for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of congratulation.</seg>
<seg id="2141">It is also available at the opening of the exhibition some Tiefes and Starkes, since Donald Trump led a war on informants from the administration camp and against Transgender troops to find new tweeters, which he should actually handle out further away.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg has been asked about the weird timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a visual reference at the gallery, the artistic statement called Manning with their superior signature among them (the "i" in their family name is provided with a heart) an end of "automatic defragmentation, whose basis is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg had hoped to show the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological ways.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully be going on is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how openly called genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective them are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as she dives together with a brushcutter in hand from the disciplines of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they kiss your speech, then they have won," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so we never have the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," said the artist, who salute from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goose of goose when talking about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition yet personally - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simakras which resemble hordes of protests.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was not aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manners Statur), where their genetic haploapals were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of men," said Dewey-Hagborg, from the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder</seg>
<seg id="2159">Nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, which was chosen as suspects, after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, his alleged involvement in Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued warrants for murder, as opposed to alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by Cook County State Court.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several jacks.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A warning system was published by the Chicago police agency that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found victims with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared at the place of action for dead, and detective investigate the engravings as murder while the police actively searches for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been an exceptional Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice President for University Relations, said in an E-Mail explanation that Lathem will be officially approved and excluded from joining the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates at this investigation," said Cubbage.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman for the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain in order to help the US investigators in every conceivable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The testimony added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and want that he placed himself.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he demanding the suspects to oppose the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police has an idea of her whereabouts, and our efforts to locate it," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said, the police got a call from the building supervisor of the Grand-Plaza building that had just had a mysterious tip that had happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident took place on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants: "the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and researches a multitude of motifs, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will complete the WADA schedule in the near future" - Russian Vice-President mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Vice President Vitaly Mutco said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti-doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">The WADA schedule was updated in this regard, "explained Mutko on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented the second part of the roadmap of WADA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for reenforcement of RUSADA and recently published on the organisation's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to concern himself.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, specifies that the Russian anti-doping authorities have disclosed the reported results of the factual-sponsored dopings in the Russian sport publicly supported by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Regarding the matter, Mutco said: "we are leading the test, because our anti-Doping system has put one error.</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">But there were no state programmes, and we will not give something that does not exist. "</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">No one has to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 as part of Doping Skandals by the WADA by the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">It was however permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the main quarrel of the organisation in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving in the right direction "to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2224">If a company is found that its staff is poorly treated or relentless, it can experience costly consequences by consumers-boycott, worker fluctuation and complaints, said QUlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for over 500 locations, to ensure that employees are aware of policies and processes and an easy way of achieving their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said it was not a good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company Convercent relies on, problems that were previously hiked by executives, which were hidden in offices in cities or countries, were identified and spoken quickly as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can closer to this holistic, 360 degree view of experience related to employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment legal disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to recount Ethics, Values and Employee's commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen broke through the Enron scandal caused by the Enron scandal.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it lasted until the Social Media came to their right, "said that companies weren't able to stop drinking dirty laundry.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology for the monitoring of ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Scent offer your software as a service, and will charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that supports the approval of venture capital investors, which supports both startups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">For funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, Conversioners received $10 million to finance the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Sparklers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and earned his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, in view of the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only Inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Staff want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites if their portfolio companies are well run. companies run well when employees are committed and engaging.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools of third promise to increase engagement and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on the staff's commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the managers are useless when managing a company does not take measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have been expecting a change in the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, this can be further disappointments and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 ideas, you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen the company to be very committed to collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"because if you don't follow the staff," Don't you really heard me?</seg>
<seg id="2251">Are you taking care of this?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you do not concern yourself, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on Glint, thus retarded.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was capable of organizing several teams within the company by the quickness of decision-making and the quality of communication, and to add a communications training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday the company will always receive new insights over the staff, and it hopes for a long term of view that leads to better bonds of workers in a industry that is well-known for high revenues.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose man, you will lose customers as well.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, you will lose your company.</seg>
<seg id="2259">The NCAA remove the two-day practices and makes a long day for the brood</seg>
<seg id="2260">At 23 o'clock, there's a lot of UCLA footprint on one side of the new exercise fields on the campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have moved out their tricot parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, they represent a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final tests before they return to the next morning at 6: 30 a.m. to the Waterman Football Center.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is a real estate for the guys for the next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday was closed on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has indeed extended its days - at least to the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore the first three trainings of the UCLA at 19: 15 begin to meet the already packed days of the player.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The course of the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the summer school six playing times in Westwood had practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are to be kept in the course of August 18, 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their prelude against Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">MORA said that he supports the rules of rules of NCAA, even if they add another point to the more busy routes of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we put this enormous load three or four days to them, and it is very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they just worked out, they move on, they are great people.</seg>
<seg id="2272">I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time, it really will be great. "</seg>
<seg id="2273">The UCLA will end their practices as soon as the camp is closed, which is exposed to the clear view of its fields of an adjacent parking area and the adjacent Luskin Center, which is already occupied with footballs, which is a protective network behind a doorposts, no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Brood players will occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mora spaced to give it a problem once these rooms are free during the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched that people rent a room there and then adjust it there to record a practice.</seg>
<seg id="2277">If you have the video oband of an exercise, it is a fairly good deal.</seg>
<seg id="2278">But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.</seg>
<seg id="2279">We will do the best with what we have.</seg>

<seg id="2284">The company said in a statement on his website that it is started using the use of updated machine techniques to identify potential folders and send them to factoTransfer, which may show results of the factotest from the original article.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Facebook was criticized as one of the main constituencies for so-called fake-news, many of which believe they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2286">The problem has become a major political theme in Europe, with the French voters aged in May with false stories, and Germany should be punished by a plan to quickly eliminate the social media networks, as before the election there in September.</seg>
<seg id="2287">On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate explanation on German that in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2288">"in addition to recognition, what stories of faculty tailed third parties, people want more context to make good decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video, and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the irl River valley in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophivalence of Yorkshireman with a preference for historic documents.</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England "spans the time from the Middle Ages up to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Wley May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes which was based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>

<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, because then a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the odor has a effect as he would have himself as well.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so busy with old papers, he is assisted by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in a castle ("To be frank") it seems all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle, to study the archives and to study the numerous treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the montailed braids at walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He migrated across the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care, gardeners, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only awarded the full access to the last attempt, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it to the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Taillcher, letters from the time of the English Empires, cards that have said: "one could think that land conflict would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let all go his way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to find out a broader base in the English history, including 'The Labourer' which leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a call which appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book with the title 'Knightly Immunology of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasantry started in this area and I thought, a insurrection was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are linked together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as' The Priest ', who had told the history of the Jesuit pilgrim for seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or "The Smuggler" in which the smuggler is portrayed from the 18th century by filling his own funeral making a coffin filled with stones (a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Dartrols are Rhodes' favorite family from Scotney: 'the men seemed to be a bit of gait, always debts and money for things that they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men quenched their school crises when they married wealthy women - I imagine it as a heap of good looking boys, with a talent to advertise within. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">Rhodes at the end of his approach in the castle is Rhodes in search of other unique write experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has taken a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Eläbes group, the grounds of a shelter from the early 20th century, which has been receded by nature again.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reform in Turkey - Erdogans fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Each year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises pensionings and grants of the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Such also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The session took place no more in the building of the general staff, as previously, but in the office of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the chairmanship of the government, the five Deputy chiefs and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs were also part of the advisors.</seg>
<seg id="2344">In doing so, civilians in the YAS were in the number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government retreats the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff Huldai Akar remains in office but the Commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy were deposed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, President Erdoğan has fired 169 on 326 Generals and Admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections for the movement of exile-Prediggers Fethullah Gülen, that Erdogan as a wire coup.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Up to 486 people who have been involved directly at the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan already referred to the overthrow of "God's gift," as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army in control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort in the Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns of an increasing Islamization "of the army which manifests itself among others in the uplift of the headscarf ban for solar dators, the newspaper wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The grandfather in the army and security forces continues to go.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July Erdogan left more 7395 national service agents, among them 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Thus, it seemed as Erdogan was tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals are older than the real masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they slip on appeal to their role as a guard of the secular government order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least under appeal to the reform proposed by the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is driven by Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In a "Vocal Europe" magazine, a particularly named officer that seeketh for the coup attempt of fear of persecution abroad, the Turkish army will be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years. "</seg>

<seg id="2376">In order to ensure the future of the race with no long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, we will begin work on the track this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and restore the distance of Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is based on this particular interest," explained by the Undersecretary of Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the course was estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of that sum, the country is taking 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country, will currently be voted, stated Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South-Thuringia as the operator are already noteworthy of technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"the roadmap, which applied to the vehicles and the quality standards, said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned agreement between the ministry and the platform will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This will allow the race to be ordered regularly on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The racing platform Shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, a pilot was tested in the course of a pilot company, whether the distance of sufficient many people is used to order them regular again in the future.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that there will be no longer crazier than in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are momentarily a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the company supply every amount of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey in the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone, which feels warm - with aware of human reactions by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt its robot according to its convictions "and also select it, from the eye-colour of the robot on the shape of the breast to the type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be more troubled, as many robots possess the "personalities" which would look like a stepford-woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to adapt their users to the properties that they look appealing, such as a schooling.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion on preprogrammed figures such as "Frigid Farrah" which gives the impression of offensive concerns and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warmed the site of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day, she has her moods - very like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many incidents regarding the rise of Sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships, but the underscores of Frigid (meaning here: conflicting) Farrah goes on, troubled one in most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it's called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something dark and deep in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will obviously not stick sex robots, and while the FRR hits their growing popularity, they are nevertheless provisionally on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is sickly out of the boundary zones, can be very educational in terms of the mind of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, until they have permission to use the free market for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed Sex robot in a time emerged in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there have been a president in the White House, who accused women attacked sexually.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most fearful aspect of the TV series' The Hand maid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the emitted eyes but how realistic this vision affects.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump but in the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with porpox proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their history wants them to feel human beings that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, in the point when it comes to its "personalities" the robot is no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from her companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background music, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Put in other words: they are counterfeitful slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redeemer of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps big power?</seg>

<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankfest there were in the USA newspapers with advice about how to circumnavigate with the horror of Trump-choosing couplings.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all suppose to make our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power Trump, to accommodate families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-left poetess who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, who visited New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me, that the unit can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows she knows, including the republican relationship, with whom they had fought for decades, suddenly and very peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it feels in a further context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the exhibiting effect of his presidency has the force to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the creepy way of making us no longer reputable one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even frightful longtime scenario, normalizes in the Trump republican of the right wing, "which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a epitome of nactics.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the mad - the dog looking at the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to trump in fact occur as very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump walks, the next candidate of the Republicans must be in good health to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Carousel's car park and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when no caffeine needed.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass design on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarky and the animals turn to look at full fear - very dark and the climess music conveys this very strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city are saying: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not righteous to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss cottage - the subject-pub - Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But Central Park-Carousel is still a strange magical experience, since two years old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on that and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, in this week, I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of five to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option to pay the valuation with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor wife at the department store was more excessively, while I am tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius covered with chest pain from prison</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius had the prison for the second time on a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">In the past year, he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of butlers, according to the disease, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder by an appeal of the prosecutors against a perpetual court.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed jetty in the early morning of the Valentine's Day in 2013, while he shot it several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he was his friend for a nocturnal intruder which hid herself in the cab.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appel this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, by which they say they are too dense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the verdict can be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is aware that his sentence increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There are no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2460">The last of the Blumberger schools were rushed out of the Hats and Epfenhofen for vacations and into the leading schools.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Three of the students in the future leave the secondary school, four to the secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2462">School manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the village of Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2463">As a symbol of school release, the 29 students of the four classes were elected by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder a young eagle that grew up in the chicken, but then released into freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">The mlower notes introduced a musical with the title "The Eagle in the chicken farm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it out of his chickens.</seg>
<seg id="2466">A small eagle first came out instead of a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope to turn out of him a chicken, spread the eagle in a high mountain spread forth his wings, and escaped.</seg>
<seg id="2468">In addition, the classes followed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young gockles, the cylinders bore to wager.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The Adler stand for the integration, said to instructors Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young was different from the other young animals (chicks), but belonged to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">But he will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">His destiny to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">She wished each four-klachler that he feels in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">We followed, thanks to the colleagues, the former school manager Michael Müller, who again jumps back with lesson periods, and the representatives coming together.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The cooking time is over, the classroom Sophia Schumacher declared.</seg>
<seg id="2477">They leave their pupils after two years of teaching only very odd as it was a really great time.</seg>
<seg id="2478">Finally, they can rely on the quachment.</seg>
<seg id="2479">For the graduation, all students had followed a song of summer time and holiday periods.</seg>
<seg id="2480">With the children, great joy broke out.</seg>

<seg id="2483">Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for Illegal Campings in Greece, quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television.</seg>
<seg id="2484">On the morning of the 1st August, a group of illegal people was arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.</seg>
<seg id="2485">The same day they were released, while currently an investigation is underway.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have sharpened the control of the free campuses and place every one who is found in a place that is not thought of for this purpose, serious financial penalties.</seg>
<seg id="2488">Checks are continued throughout the season.</seg>
<seg id="2489">The ministry said that the Court can impose a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Software Update for Diesel Cars: what You Need To Know</seg>
<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Must diesel drivers participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">You should improve the emission behaviour of the emissions trading emissions of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-diesel or worse are exempted.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe provides assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new promotion mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the handled software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have Schumann software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofitting was ordered by the Federal Office of the Federal Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The makers have announced an excellent implementation in the coming months, but is still not an exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler conveyed to write any subject.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If anyway an inspection may be due, it will be done in their framework.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long should the changes apply?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"difficult to say" means Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The connections of the manufacturer's engagement as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen how the dealership can act on the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should it last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time consuming it could be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers do, who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen family?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE closes down.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Presumably foreign manufacturers would trace, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is a massive price breakdown of Euro-4 cars now?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE fear that.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But just in the regions, where drifts became threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2519">There is no loss of losses in rural areas so far.</seg>
<seg id="2520">The ACE closes, with a sale yet to be waiting.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award</seg>
<seg id="2522">The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2523">The first prize was promised by President Trump, politics.</seg>
<seg id="2524">One of the winners will not come - protest.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The Cool J (49) receives one of the coveted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center as the first Rapper.</seg>
<seg id="2526">This year, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The awards will be delivered at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will stage a reception together with his wife Melania at the award.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The award winner announced with progressive TV series announced that this was due to participate in the Gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">He said: "the New York Times" said: "this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights, even the means - and that burdened me."</seg>
<seg id="2531">The 59-year-old Estefan stressed, they will use trump to make sense of view.</seg>
<seg id="2532">According to the former president John F. Kennedy, Kennedy-Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hranks and Sting.</seg>
<seg id="2534">We make the city worth living</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs City Builder, goes to pension in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - appropriate applicants are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker is Wacker City Builder since 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still fun, as he taught in the press talk.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports from diverse, but also demanding tasks, which are waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, no application is shown to fill the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus - adherance to the regular period of notice - still enough time for elaboration.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach has been a member of the administrative district as a sub-law office, the Candidate must submit relevant fasteners.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city definitely.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they cannot fill it any more, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the city's proximity to it is important, Wacker, who also reports from a good company climate as well as good sentiment between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than 30 years in office, several major projects have accumulated, looking back at the Wacker with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is assured over the office and its staff.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, diverse projects are based on the agenda: the reshaping of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niedernfenparkland are stimulated.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium extension is still a theme.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone will strike at about 1.5 million euros under beech, "if we do it correctly, Wackers thought.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design is available for a city building master of large games.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs own building yard and gardener, there can be quite flexible in many things.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," hackers, and the design of green spaces is often commended by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town stands as a ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have "one eye to it" if new buildings are approved, "stresses the creeping caretaker.</seg>
<seg id="2558">For the StadtbauMaster, high responsibility already carries responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is builder, "at the end everything works here over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">In support and coordination, he can count on many years of employee: Markus Neumaier (high-building) has been doing for ten years, Manfred Schoer (draught) for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also, that his successor has long remains, Wacker: "we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Because continuity is not only important for a good company climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Who wants to bury Roland Wacker, should have completed a completed academic or Bachelor's studies as a Graduate Engineer or Bachelor in Master's Architecture and have a good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and planning rights.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The city office building has high-quality construction, construction planning, barblossoms, urban property, urban property with building yard and urban gardening and lower building authority, including the monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bike on pipes are thrown off: ground line blocked</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, unknown offenders have had the blue bicycle from the track to be placed on the lines in the Leobener Strasse (B116).</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male dancers and are looking for the night hours after them.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the crime scene, a throttle scooter and a bike driver were observed at the crime scene.</seg>

<seg id="2571">The offender could have brought themselves in great danger and also endanger the train traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage at Lok and the equipment as well as the late-moving transport costs, even pelonals of rail customers might remain on the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">The speaker said in total, as a result of a "considerable" sum, the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damage were fixed on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south route could be led without disability.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Almost ten passenger cars were out of Friday afternoon, two of them concerned the district traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains were not falling, but they were late, however.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB's spokesman Christoph Posch had to be replaced roughly 200 metres high.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel diseases)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">However, a new study claims the opposite: a diet which is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US, affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain, caused magnfs and bloody attacks, recurring or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers usually come to alleviate their symptoms, researchers were found at the Washington University to develop the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins that promote immune cells, which promote a tolerant digestion.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior Scientist, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that Immune cells in the gut will patrol in order to make sure that harmful microbes that hide in the food, do not enter the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of unable to trigger infections, are offset by cells which protect the tolerance and damage the body without being sensitive to sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far towards infection, it may result in an anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments I was found that a kind of tolerance conduit immunity occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice of their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a combination of tryptophan is tolerant, less anti-inflammatory bowel problems, if the same system also raves in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral Award in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was searching for a kind of immunology that found the tolerance when it found out that a group of study group had such cells, but another group of the same is that it had not been accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It suspects that the difference with the intestinal microscope of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">Mice of mice were sequenced by DNA sequences and six bacterial species were found in mice with the immune cells, but was missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment so they did not have a gut microbiome, and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria spread the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri could grow in a fluid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to inmature immunocells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the tryptophan metabolic syndrome, known as the indol 3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, increased number of such cells by around 50 percent, but when the tryptopical gains have halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant conduit cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect the intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans so as in mice but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to encourage, because these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially can lead high tryptopical values in the presence of L. reuteri to an expansion of this population. "</seg>
<seg id="2604">Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "genius"</seg>
<seg id="2605">With Nemanja Matic, at Manchester United, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut at Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The 40 million pounds of Chelsea has started with a 2: 1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and impressing in the holder's role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.</seg>
<seg id="2607">However, Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and managed to give only 45 minutes, what Mourinho was able to improve before the start of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks Soccer," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"we will help him be ready sooner than later."</seg>
<seg id="2610">Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho as Mourinho as its start-XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Independent Concerning in this week, that Mourinho loved three more new ones, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of its four main obligations.</seg>
<seg id="2612">"three out of four, thank you for making the association," he added.</seg>
<seg id="2613">"I will be happier if they get four out of four from four, but they have given great effort."</seg>
<seg id="2614">Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky</seg>
<seg id="2615">The Boeing aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dreamliner about the US, which is several thousand kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="2617">The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.</seg>
<seg id="2618">On the radar monitors the shape of a Dreamliner was to be.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The whole was a test test for new engines.</seg>

<seg id="2622">New draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind twisted him: as Sigmar Gabriel, the SPD boss, looked up and prime minister of prime minister before election always with a certain concern to Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Just no fire from the party, merely no headwind from the League, as the main desire of the election champion.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz has changed the party, the fundamentally changed.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the staff from the Willy-Brandt-House with growing tendencies are observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Mr Schulz from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were deep suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after another.</seg>
<seg id="2630">The League-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens after the astonishing end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this is once more: red-green can easily be reliable," said CDU-Secretary Peter Tauber the publishing network in Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising fraction of a Green Representatives has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the dire-election, his red-green coalition lost its own votes against the opposition of CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green national manager Michael Kellner has asked for the subsidy lower Saxon Green Deputies Elke Twest to return to their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The Coming of the CDU is a clear falseance of voters.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Tot must immediately return to its mandate, "said the Federal Managing Director and campaign for the Greens of the Green Party (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"but all this can't be true," she sighed a SPD election victory, when Friday afternoon, the new HiobsCourt, attaches the party center.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD-Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing over the CDU of the Like Tvests to the CDU without a government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what's next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpectedly marked defeat at the Saarland in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more not, the comrades looked after.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">It became even worse - and everything became much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Tauride, the Düsseldorf-Pleite shook the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades settled down again in the weeks after laboriously.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then when she had slipped a new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with it came the next deep gulf.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD state, lost its aura at that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his town burned.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he was wrong with the crisis, so quite something that you can do is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then Scholz is fighting for political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Due to the VW exhaust and its role in the supervisory board, the lower saxonian Prime Minister already stood in criticism for some time.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese detenings were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Anyway, or perhaps just so, because in the past weeks, because in the past weeks, he increasingly sought to set accents in the Confederation.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The endeavour of the former civil champion of Hanover, to expand its power in Berlin, was not hidden by Martin Schulz as well.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant him, because they refused to be a stabilization of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could happen.</seg>
<seg id="2659">But then, in the partakers of the party, he does not have any guilt because of the partisan kennels.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz does not have at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">And the comrades therefore try to keep their own ranks.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Their wrath is directed at the Greens, and here above all on the betral parliamentarisation in Tvests.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democratifying, as Mrs. Tvests disappoints her own career on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group, the editor of the German Editor (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Mrs. Tshelters is not responsible for their personality as a direct candidly, but have been elected to parliament on the national list of the lower Saxon parliament.</seg>

<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 the surplus was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote the interior development, and exclude just new construction regions.</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, the submission order should be made possible, so that year will be started with the renovations in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">After that, Pietzschmann stated that each Commune would carry out regulatory inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It comes to evaluate and decide the urban wastings, and decide when sangued and in what circumference is.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will be also a focus on the property in the book.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come once again to Empfingen and become a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel stressed, a major success factor for the project was the participation of the parties concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks, and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot sheet," which manages the structural condition and restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2700">The gray questionnaire, the "household and housing design," can be made up to size, distribution and residents of a residential area.</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "operating bow" can only be completed when the building is operated in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, God pointed out to be aware that a solid questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">New construction are also not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler stressed that the distribution of funding from the mediator principle after "greyhound-principle - who first comes first, mahlt first.</seg>
<seg id="2705">No funding could be reserved for later. "</seg>

<seg id="2714">The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands</seg>
<seg id="2715">The White House, a marine helicopter to the South Lawn in the last month, will cost taxpayers to the TIME magazine which had been handed over to the TIME magazine for up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products of all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">A helicopter built in Connecticut was a yacht out of Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter shown on the South Lawn, the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 am in the morning at the South Lawn on the occasion of the event, and so long until the grass had been vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 in this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds, if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service, a second team would need for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">During the event, the original flight was used during the event, while security guards remained at the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Out of the recordings provided at the TIME were not clear, if a second flight is ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Brands Act shall forbid the federal state to use national property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Record records indicate that HMx-1 has asked whether the event could harm the outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question that we were asked whether it was a violation of the Brands Hatch, and we were informed that this was not the case," he wrote the commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," answered the Deputy Commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Brands Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events have political tones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President grants an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to increase governmental reform.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One is, from politically neutral purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2733">President are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use is only for a photo-OP, is uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="2735">In February, Trump led an investigation into the background of his first campagrallye in Melbourne, Florida, TaxiServices, and his Twitter account is full of messages which complained about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is impressed by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states are produced, produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Chairman of the White House, Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMx-1 crews frequently perform training flights in the region around Washington and in South Lawn by suspend US president in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">As a trump in early July on the G20 summit in Germany, HMx-1 introduced 58 exercise landings at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The flight for the "Made in America" event was one of the training requirements for the month, said an official.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helikopter units flew an additional 11 hours to the Day for Non-Presidency Supporters. "</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers had been the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in creating a helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMx-1 does not maintain a budget record for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stunentarifen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD replacement is set for the VH-3D 24.380 USD per ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Recordings of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of tax payers on the basis of estimates for compensation is highly misleading," said Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are contained in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the funds set for DoD do not include staff expenses, but consider the cost of fuel, maintenance, and conclusion of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At that time, the former White House, Sean Spades, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week, which are made in America," said Spada.</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people depend on this.</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course, it is reasonable to highlight it. "</seg>
<seg id="2755">It was not clear if Trump was interacting as a helicopter above the South Lawn in the event, but he sat in the drivers seat of a fireman car.</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives from Sikorsky and was joking over his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="2757">"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2883">The Touran drivers had the control plan at the touchscreen.</seg>
<seg id="2884">Sachalin arose at the passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The driver of the opposite car, a Mercedes Benz, had passed a truck and continued to worry about the traffic accident.</seg>
<seg id="2886">According to the accident, it may well be good that the mercedcer had not noticed an accident.</seg>
<seg id="2887">The police now asks witnesses of the incident and the driver of the causal plane to get in touch with the traineeship in Stolzenau under tel. 05761 / 92060.</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domsparrow report relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domsparrow report presents the misuse of Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This, author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the failure of the Regensburger Domsparrow continues to provide discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissenler, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," explained by the former Rainsburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger all would express its deepest submissions or her back false evaluation of the operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican Council of "Osservatore Romano" on the other hand, however, criticized that in the reporting of violence in the sparrow with "two measure" was measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the grips in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have to prevent "shameful and shameful actions." but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and preparing the public opinion to maintain normal for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also, the interview for Thurn und Taxis played an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we would like to go to the Church and that's a perfect frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are not fair to use standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse were often referred to as Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was translated with Ratzinger, "My brother," written in 12 languages.</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take George Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese in Regensburg with the enlightenment of Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 colonies were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plums" victims of attacks, 67 Domsparrow sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 until 1994: "summarizing, so we have been employed in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionalisation the punishment for the pupils could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims were killed by R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are combined with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Milan Domsparrow, Georg Ratzinger and his opinion, were relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report about the "occurrences of violence-violence against women slaughtered in the Regensburger Domsparrow, exists a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students take up his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears as a cholera and perfectionist used for the latter, when a domain kit made no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you compare this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly under suspicion of every suspected of middle or co-union with the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also, the geography texts at the preschool took place outside of his sphere of residence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to discard him too late or having taken the first incentives not to be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domasatzengymnu, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all interrodents - as literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus also the broad majority of its students Georg Ratzinger also expresses it as "warmhearted", "popular," sincere, "" competent "and" intelligible teacher, "who provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always relocated by hand of grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complying about his perfectionism and his highly Emotional Emotional, which also led to rage.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he threw it not only with chairs and threw the keychain on the ground, but also he also appealed to the hair, but also listened to him many years ago, and he apologized and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It has to be said to his honesty, however, that such education methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, widespread with parents as for teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you have still know such kind of breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everybody was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually goes in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the food-texts at the preschool, are the liberate excavators.</seg>
<seg id="2926">So you ask yourself if it is not to do with his notoriety and role as a brother by Benedict XVI, that a lot of media overthrew herself.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Bishop so many who have never understood him, still eagerly awaited.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domsparrow have been reported in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger will also put some processing or conjuction with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk with my father or mother about it," said a man-man representative for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the reconnaissance of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims turn from scam.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, it certainly not a chorus who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Quatzinger students evaluate Ratzinger's role in the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student still formulated this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no fall in which he had had the findings in which he could have had been arrested (Georg Ratzinger) and the relevant offenders could have been arrested.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for a really absurd to accept that... Bubbles put in urgent or more clearly, as compared to their parents, internatsguides, confidence teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report belongs to the very clear result: "that in the apopactly affected pupils and / or their surrounding areas, the report could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus cannot it be cast out, it cannot be prevented or brought to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to get its good name with these contradictory crimes, as it sadly happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "Gewallycence" was to be read by the Regensburatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former domenmaster Georg Ratzinger is thrown into the "Wegner" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that we mixed everything in the reporting and mentions a huge milking from sexual abuse and mitwallysis and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is just a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Because it is clean separated: between the preschool and the high school of the Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report prevents incidents from time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger does not have choir director.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys from sadistic teachers were widened and maligned, all took place on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where real scandalous states have to have ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only too face when they were already on the Domoterogcolmnay.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, just like most witnesses, the subject of "Vorwerk," tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domotavengymnay?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a real discipline, but there is no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report is coming to the conclusion that "many victims were invaluable to the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases will even bind positive memories of him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most this remains the reproach to have looked.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he reported from the conditions on pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was in charge of the predecessors at a school, where he was not working and responsible, (so witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Do Georg Ratzinger flowed in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, for in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domotavengymnasium who also reproduces the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In it, he pointed out this to be practised in the preparatory process. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">As a result of the danger of negative publicity, he recommended to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity as a test was forbidden also in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, she took place in a legal gray area, just as everybody knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate that, where those concerned may be exaggerated or dramatised, and where truly the permitted limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say, he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">It's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test sentence of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principality in Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said it was unfair to use today's pedagogical standards the times of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians speak as of "trajections of anachronism," thus the danger, the past, according to present moral affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Of course the princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true of sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what is broken in the preschool of resistance and violence at innocent children's schools, that goes far beyond the way.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all very dreadful and I'm glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take George Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and punishment, so Tinnitus and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, it has also strictly taken hold of it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his time in his time is Georg Ratzinger played for the book "My brother of the Pope" in the interviews?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prüm as well come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., at his perspective, they just played a minor part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not necessarily mean that he led a strict regime there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without these perfectionism, without the demand unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form the national cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition from the until then twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone one does not make any big singer and stand out of any success in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger for their talks with Georg Ratzinger?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I met Georg Ratzinger and was over again a wonderful, humorous and hearty, deep-believing, deeply believing and hearty people who could not imagine that he could do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former Domsparrows are still living, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him to read it - he is almost blind and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who cannot forgive him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are grateful to him today that he enriches her life and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly I might be - but also a lovable respect to which they are still looking up and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that is accented to him are guardian methods that were then on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long ago long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has a still prominent brother to make the medial sinibex.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Then the evil intent that stands behind it, is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the approach was to have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without Germany's outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one could know the Regensburger Domsparrow in peace.</seg>
