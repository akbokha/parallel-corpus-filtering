Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers .
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that was clearly understood by the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; I will always be put in drawers or I accum@@ ulate from the outside label which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ gh for me . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of your favorite , actress sp@@ ends her time at home , on TV with lo@@ qu@@ ish roofs and Mexican food , it &apos;s written in the magazine .
for white @-@ glu@@ es it is the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; we do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says Hollywood star .
in her new film , Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play , &quot; A@@ ni@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyr@@ amids of sports
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger studied a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 year old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after some minutes the horses re@@ minded their holiday , they were hunting in their fast Gal@@ lop home to feed the feeding .
a kilometre at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he left himself with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even s@@ lick to photo frames .
this was the first time in Aachen , making the CH@@ IO for the first time .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sport watch handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala dinner .
hon@@ ours the sympath@@ etic pat@@ rons are not .
Grand Cross Order , Silver with lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has killed him .
the 18th winner of the pyramid of sports is long .
in Aachen he met the first lau@@ re@@ ates Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means to me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the young talents .
and thus he received the prize money of 25.000 Euros .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; in Saturday .
the excellent members of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , who was born by Fe@@ eder Cornelia Han@@ au , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the founder of the founder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the beloved Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously of the hand@@ ful@@ ler Erhard Wonder@@ ful .
many of these sports le@@ gends had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the unusual society immig@@ rated to the Spring@@ field , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger took a distance from the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
to invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are in charge of tax and energy policy as well as in principle .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is one of the basic and philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the State .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt small in doubt and war@@ ns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and controls .
Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says .
but by contrast , it would be quite different .
there will be massive shut@@ down and it turns out for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies .
Clinton indeed says : the state has certain tasks to open , he has a@@ dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money for that .
therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the infrastructure .
to invest in the m@@ uts , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost literally .
the democratic candidate is announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ ritual Te@@ ach@@ y wings of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus even partial internal discussions could be added on tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and plant the coal for coal in the USA .
oil extraction must also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate agreement intends to cancel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ less trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both companies not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but simply only American jobs .
they should be paid even better , e.g. Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a star@@ vation wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policies of the two camps .
on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics believe him , that the budget deficit would make it even bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton stands that at least demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are alone to escape , almost to everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a wide kitchen there are four women .
every one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put its little son in the arm .
he looks great with big eyes in the room .
his mother star@@ es to the table top .
until she noticed that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and k@@ isses the little .
the scene is normal .
Katrin B@@ ahr is talking to Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the division managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a support for social support in Bavaria , and amongst others on the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised accommodation for single women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s help of Women .
they have been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - either as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man from the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically prosec@@ uted , because of them torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope . &quot;
in women , other reasons behind the escape : &quot; many are secretly ent@@ an@@ gled because they don &apos;t see another out@@ going . &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ ishing , slavery or forced pro@@ st@@ itution .
this is driving them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; the tu@@ g@@ boat for example call for a bottle of water a sexual action is no rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany , B@@ ahr is telling .
here too , single women in refugee camps are often considered as inferior and mis@@ used .
this leads to some 90 percent of women who live in the North of Munich , trau@@ mati@@ zed at the apartment .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are acc@@ ust@@ omed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they often don &apos;t need to help , there are more accommodations for them , for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees .
on the question of whether they continue from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , some answers with no .
there is no such thing in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken .
even in Schw@@ aben , alone women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press Officer of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Sub@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are available floors or their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central hotels for women only .
the Committee on women and Gender Equality adopted by the European Parliament also calls for women to be detached from men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the privacy of men and women are missing , there can be - for@@ getting - violence against women . &quot;
and especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women , it is included in the study .
as much as the women feel this need , one can disc@@ ern the crowds starting at the house in Munich .
&quot; having been around since it has been around us , we have a long queu@@ es , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could easily build a second house .
general strikes : claims according to new working safety measures
representatives of the Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new workers measures in their dispute concerning a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire advice , appro@@ ving more working measures starting in early September .
the J@@ DC said that there was Minister for ministers , to respond to the wor@@ ries about the contract .
general practition@@ er and medical students have agreed to the re@@ jection of a contract in July , agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; har@@ r@@ ly quiet &quot; which led to problems that the treaty was rejected .
she said , &quot; In view of him , the J@@ DC Bureau voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and calls for official new negotiations for all your wor@@ ries . &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board today submitted a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council for a running program of escal@@ ating workers , which begins early September to appro@@ ve .
the disputes carried out that Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians this year took six times , the first overall sei@@ z@@ ure in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leaders of the BM@@ A Assist@@ enz@@ ines Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to re@@ jection the agreed conditions that were suggested by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , before the vote was attended by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , which the agreement should be advant@@ ageous and should be assumed .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of External lateral &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
Russia &apos;s leaders of Russia and Turkey came on Tuesday to announce their hands and to proc@@ laim the official end of the eight months of the words of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ part in the g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of St. Petersburg Palace in the reception , I can not forbi@@ d them that Ankara wanted to do these recon@@ ciliation .
there was no fight , yes .
but Put@@ in sm@@ iles were very dirty and he spar@@ ed little warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan , on the other hand , talked about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve it .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ ogan would have gone so beha@@ ved something bad .
my enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable au@@ dac@@ ity showed that Russia &apos;s State had not forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to mention in his quotes : the shooting of a Russian campaign against Turkey on the Syrian border .
in Moscow in response to the time of Moscow was w@@ ron@@ ged .
Putin told him and accused Ankara to ad@@ mit Russia into the back .
the result was even greater , as it was committed by a false friend .
the show@@ case will be re@@ build , if not impossible , even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would carry for everything the blame .
most seriously , the accus@@ ations of senior officials have benefited from the illegal oil trade in the fields of Syria , which would be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic state .
he disputed that v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the ap@@ ologi@@ zing , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind victory .
to Ankara , the advantages of a ceas@@ e@@ fire are obvious .
Erd@@ ogan is primarily required all the friends he can get , after he had a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his eye .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey were sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban of bat@@ ches , which usually generate several million Russian tourists every year to Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resumed .
they count towards a late @-@ season ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week , state television funded fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated this : &quot; tourists there are long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it was a reaction to trying power as a weak answer .
to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll talks on the EU acc@@ eding negotiations and Putin - that is out of the cool mood to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian state of state won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara , having called for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat against the selected state organs .
this is well @-@ evident for Moscow to have a self @-@ understanding , which even has a profound fear of opponents .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace was enabled in Russia and Turkey , a way it was an analy@@ st once descri@@ bing me an analy@@ st , &quot; alliance of out@@ side@@ ways . &quot; two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel po@@ or@@ ly treated .
nevertheless , despite the public recon@@ ciliation , there are still vast differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow dropped the role as a pe@@ ac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey will support mutual pages .
it could be not@@ ing that after almost three hours of first discussion , both presi@@ dents say on the press conference , that they would not even have stri@@ ped the issue .
Turkey was deliber@@ ately avoided the President of Turkey to answer their differences when Putin decided to emphas@@ ise it .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ asters , as NATO member Turkey dra@@ fting the Russian mar@@ g@@ jet - it certainly is better that the two leaders say at least one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Chairman of the Bank , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a Back@@ office Role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan has divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand had been connected to the global amb@@ itions of the Bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ ressed since then , when they had been almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this time , &quot; R@@ BS &quot; brand strateg@@ ist uses to protect other end @-@ consumer brands .
it supported international sport with millions of pounds to Sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Day Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to move more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales every RS@@ B references , the headquarters and stock exchange quot@@ ation are changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other but smaller brands for private clients , which will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he divided the BBC Scotland with us : &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes one of our investors &apos; brand and to the brand that our staff is employed , since we will now become a bank of stamps . &quot;
when the Bank has become a global brand itself , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I am saying that we are not pursu@@ ing global goals , but are pursu@@ ing local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own par@@ ishes for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be continued by its six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop toward the Bank of brands , for how do we concentrate on it ( we asked ) to make this a better bench for clients ? &quot; he said the Board of Management .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we said we had a great bank for our customers and we have launched this brand .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can be launched back these brands , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori att@@ ains its 3@@ .000@@ ,000 gain at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne from a double with New@@ market , which brings him 3@@ .000@@ ,000 gain
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3@@ .000@@ ,000 British win in New@@ market .
he worked on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction that is trained by John G@@ os@@ den , on his local race track with his second gain a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches milestone in the flat races .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Doug Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ p and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy about it happened at New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago .
there is no big meetings , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori absor@@ bs the Je@@ wel when he brings victory to Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s have reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in an annual career .
L@@ ester pig@@ g@@ ott , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 points of career
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone , a few before him reached .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct , which differs him from the other in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusi@@ ast@@ ically fans for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 wins , if he would not only have a weekend and big tur@@ bo@@ charger !
Frank@@ ie has already made almost 30 years winner , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition , it is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated a milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of big tur@@ ni@@ ers win , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he survived also a plane crash and got a drug banned .
three years ago he was in trouble when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic thickness to def@@ y his branch and return to its pre@@ face .
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said earlier that he wants to continue with competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russian Putin fir@@ ert senior staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin told unexpected his staff of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a lot of years of closest trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as special specialist for environmental and transport matters .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin had ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy in the company since 2012 , was named as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in Tallinn , capital of Tallinn , he graduated in International Relations Department of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later was later vice president and head of the government .
he said to Putin on his appointment , &quot; thank you for trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to assist your activity as a state of state security and inspec@@ tions in implementing your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted confi@@ dan@@ ins and works as he worked for the Soviet Intelligence Service , K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed to withdraw at his own request .
but despite the ri@@ di@@ ment for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this one .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once was referred to as a potential President once more would lead to Russian environmental policies - faced a great scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say this very complicated post - they could almost say - to inc@@ ite them for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential management for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V recorded the post in December 2011 .

Que@@ ens@@ till Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ till Cros@@ sen with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four appoint@@ ments of the &quot; stud dog &quot; which will approach the bridge around each of the three towers of the bridge .
the ro@@ aring section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 scra@@ p rop@@ es .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister of Economy Keith Brown finished the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
he said , &quot; It is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ till Cros@@ sen .
we are all witnesses of a engineering process of a truly ep@@ ic measure of this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the completion between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
a total of 79 % of the total bridge links in their place and the last section of the de@@ cks gets a bet@@ ting kiss to the deck today , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a considerable milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ quality and deep @-@ construction .
after the installation of the last road cut and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck structure we had to close the still existing gap on the northern or country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern fe@@ eder jet@@ ty 700 millimeter to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate function .
mas@@ sively , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , approx . 6.000 tons weighs and with an ascent of approximately 3 % had to be drawn up .
getting , given the toler@@ ances running on the team , they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
three men still have their chance to be alive , &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station last Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert , after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .

&quot; we saw how the boat was turned around and introduced us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station from Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; thank@@ fully the strong winds have already blown the boat except of their reach until we left to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted in the age of 60 and was found at a bu@@ oy without a life@@ jacket .
they came all aboard the boat carrying boat carrying were brought back to the rescue station .
Mr Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have been lucky to be alive and still alive .
while the boat engine had an emergency stop , this triggered the boat off the boat from the person to control the boat .
someone has wa@@ xed about these men today .

so she went out with her companion from the house .
they met the ex @-@ life partner of man on the street .
when the two women re@@ acted the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old gave his sister to his side and took his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds German le@@ asing apartments ?
the SPD and the Green Party : investors are becoming a lot more likely to be taken into duty .
how will we respond to the bad news that Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose almost 1300 wooden homes in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action concept &quot; in the next grid .
however conflict is programmed .
first and foremost , it is all about the question : who should build the favorable flats ?
a regulation is missing so far .
the SPD Vice @-@ President Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; we are happy with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , will in future be 20 percent of all flats than social deliveries . &quot;
however , the favorable flats can also arise in the stocks .
but the great traffic in the town hall was , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are you going to grow with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development program , which costs millions of dollars and has to be financed , is scheduled to provide for incen@@ tives .
the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few times as possible .
the left still wants a hardness for investors .
regardless of this , if Brat@@ mann , the flag is an increase of the situation in the housing market .
the action concept will be implemented , will provide additional duties in the administration building .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear if we will get the professionals .
but the program is not completely completely : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
but how can you compare the loss of about 1300 favorable flats , whose promotion will run in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , such as planning for Nicole Palm , planned bind@@ ings should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the pricing .
this is possible in the western city .
in one fell sw@@ oop to solve the problem .
because in the western city the end of the year are underway .
around 1800 apartments you could get there in pricing for affordable housing .
only : this is the owner , the housing companies do not want .
since the number of social allow@@ ances in the western city is dra@@ stically increased , you remove from the target of the so @-@ called circul@@ ating mixture .
there is no longer a concentration of social sh@@ aking in just a few parts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be movement in the discussion .
the Group &apos;s leader Holger Her@@ atter@@ sch@@ ke means : &quot; for a wide majority the CDU must take into the boat . &quot;
I have focused on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean , that no com@@ promises may be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
that teenage boys and child to play no longer go outside but rather they prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens , was su@@ ing over the last decade of many .
with Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
the screen on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and finally on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not open each other .
I am referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand appeared in early July .
the market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that over@@ l@@ apped the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players arrive outside with their smartphones to search out and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which are followed with a GPS and once they have found , &quot; photograph &quot; ( above a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; taken &quot; . &quot;
a generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jum@@ ped for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps which rec@@ alls the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch , followed the 35@@ ,000 users , divided the Washington Post earlier , that in two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 30 percent , who jum@@ ped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays with Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just provides raw data for the increase in performance .
many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns are going to take care of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport may not be reviewed .
those who regularly drive sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bring people to do something in the open , which makes them enjoyable .
in this way , three pillars of health are covered - Movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friends on hunting .
as always , there are also m@@ eri@@ ous play destro@@ ys , which must always compl@@ ain about .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
it has become a breakthrough .
even though smartphone apps like Fitbit activity tra@@ ced back earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use is delayed by time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help so many people on hunting , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in dam@@ aging the dam
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now , finally , the Olympic champion .
on Thursday , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m obtained the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall results of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American woman of Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the sul@@ be@@ bar during the single struggle of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight victory and consoli@@ dates the fifth one , while it consoli@@ dates the best of its generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her end was shown and her long journey was found in that moment .
this success makes them in the same League such as Michael P@@ helps , who gave their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 &apos; Mary Lo@@ u b@@ ail@@ on told her that she was &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I ever saw . &quot;
they expected the last examination in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American woman of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace with gold and silver in the single multi @-@ struggle of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday and won
Bil@@ es collected the first medal on Tuesday , while in retirement of his retirement , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i retired in retirement .
although it was worth it , during their long departure on the top , never the future is planned , it &apos;s not true .
a part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is voted for Latin American music that would fit your home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
it is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , which was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became the power .
since the summer of 2013 she has lost no more fight competition , a winning series which will continue so long as it wishes .
even when Must@@ afa led by two turns , the image dar@@ ed .
bott@@ led and so@@ res - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - lau@@ rels .
they repeated again 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig again - and there was an 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor yet another .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her soft@@ ly than her En@@ der@@ g@@ ness - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision she had once lived in her collection book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when they fought for the third place , but the bronze head was in a low place Must@@ afa .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man capit@@ alists , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her floor , she threw the audience watching his c@@ ousin , overwhel@@ med with a com@@ eback , which was sometimes doub@@ tful .
as for Bil@@ es , the Twe@@ et has quickly spread a whole new significance of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week .
police : 3 victims killed in series mur@@ der@@ ation in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who were killed in one of the most deadly attacks by Phoenix in one decade , while they listened to the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator che@@ ered eight shots from a manual weapon , while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , then read the report .
the police told , that the tri@@ ad murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the att@@ ack@@ ers refused to carry out the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which belonged to one of the adult victims .
the Police Academy by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators was directed to become a closer look if it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in H@@ isp@@ anic residential objects within four months in nine months and two injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard Z@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that susp@@ ects has used several cars , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to specify the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed to the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness , the police told that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty Pick@@ up truck about half an hour prior to the thir@@ teen murder and assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and ensured a sphere from the seat as well as glob@@ ular fragments from the engine bay .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro @-@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the fe@@ west of his age , Edmund Mikro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing of her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , I was my first thought , I don &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not leave me .
which is not right at all -- naturally , one has settled on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that even though he could never know them under circumstances , and that he might not even survive it .
some doctors even went so far that they struck Him to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I did not know that people are still doing &apos; , &quot; explained pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of help .
Edmund was unable to sit or cra@@ w@@ l up to his third year , and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Edmund worked for &quot; Please bring me something off . &quot;
&quot; we put the drawing language in , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not a typical character language -- it says . I invented some miracles alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as to Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as masks or cy@@ ic@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I constantly ask what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
for a long time I did not ask for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the cy@@ ic@@ av@@ irus .
it gets better .
you know it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present for me under the Women &apos;s Olympics and that is more than one reason .
first of all , I joined the summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secon@@ dly , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which looked for many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , who is Cath@@ o@@ lics , is of every proud .
this crew finally reflects the USA .
it has consoli@@ dates the black and H@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , number one under the female tower was a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year was Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and the Americas che@@ ered .
now the world was able to prove the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but master@@ ful gymn@@ astic routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won an individual multi @-@ struggle event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are witness@@ ing the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gy@@ ms throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it to the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four tur@@ ner@@ gies in the team . Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i is the last year as a trainer .
but the reality looks that gymn@@ ast@@ ics are an expensive sport and Turner first in private gymn@@ ast@@ ics that are maintained by parents , which are in@@ adequate for the training , alignment , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list can be continued at any time .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in weal@@ thy countries that can help business .
in these clubs , Turner will maintain their overall training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ ast@@ ics .
we need to insp@@ ect the commun@@ ion with countless , young girls , that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a skilled and easier @-@ to @-@ reach gym training .
I founded my doctorate in 20 years .
for my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban te@@ ens ( mainly black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
strength , strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind .
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong benefits to health , as well as for professional and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to interest for the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that is great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real picture of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thanks , you take so many young girls with different background to begin their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after Jerem@@ y H@@ ts proposal rejected the proposal
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the argument over the changes by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist Treaty by the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 associates who vote in a vote .
in July , Hunt &apos;s plans revealed to lead the contract by for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; if any further delay would be harmful for the employees and patients .
the first resident companies should receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend work to improve maintenance .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ er of Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians stayed last night in a communication with : &quot; Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians have reached the proposed treaty in particular that it will take care of the present calendar crisis and to treat all doctors . &quot;
with just eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A contribute to the solution of the dispute through talks on the government &apos;s sake and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was done by saying that Jerem@@ y Hunt just made the last month that his door would always open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt is now going to take up the up@@ scale and concerns the concerns of the resident companies . &quot;
if he did not do this , the intern doctors have clearly made that they are ready to carry out more labor measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routines and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , as nur@@ ses and specialists became involved to provide doctors on the stri@@ k@@ post chain .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to stop the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist Treaty by the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better week pay for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , asked the assistant doctors to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past two months we talked to the tea of Assist@@ enz@@ in@@ arians , and with the health ministry as well as other minist@@ ries were positively answered with regard to the wor@@ m@@ ity and W@@ hist@@ o@@ lov@@ ings .
the employers hop@@ ed for the continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as a deployment , flexibility for training , training sessions , and the gender @-@ specific wage differenti@@ als in medicine - such as seriously the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the observ@@ ance of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack death
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug due to the authorities recommended by the authorities for a longer period of time .
the drug drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repe@@ ating heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
this medication is given a heart attack for 12 months , causing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulation of the N@@ HS has a four year in@@ gest@@ ion recommended to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation of the N@@ HS has a four year in@@ gest@@ ion recommended to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer from a heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by collecting fatty material in the arter@@ ies that re@@ semble floor@@ ings .
if the t@@ opping breaks up , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ gged the flow of blood to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it may flow through blood stream and clo@@ gged the flow of blood to the brain , which causes a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ ec@@ a , is marketed under the merchant name Bri@@ li@@ que , reducing this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the design draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month in@@ gest@@ ion of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Service Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with des@@ pat@@ ro@@ us consequences . &quot;
fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand the available options to thousands of people who benefit from this .
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the introduc@@ tory bill does not advise the treatment that goes beyond this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness allows you to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ in Rah@@ man became a last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report for corruption from office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to largely ignored elec@@ toral fraud in Muslim communities such as a fatal government report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , which is now an anti @-@ corrosive environment , said that it should be forbidden for v@@ oters from various religious motives so that it should be allowed to set the police out of choice of elec@@ tors in order to protect the v@@ oters out of elec@@ tors .
he recommends that v@@ oters should make a reference to prove their identity in elections .
at present a v@@ oter must call his name and address .
the report proposes un@@ removing ink on the finger of a person , if she re@@ sign her choices to prevent someone to choose twice .
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive greater protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal materials and decisions of un@@ official comp@@ as@@ ers or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against const@@ itu@@ encies , but shall also protect the Communist government before the wider corruption and financial concentration of corruption , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Election sk@@ and@@ als in the East London .
last year , a special court ruled that the acting Mayor Lut@@ i Rah@@ man should be pursued after a Lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics to silence .
&quot; Rachel &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were up to 300 voices , either doub@@ tful or the result of a im@@ itation , where one person cho@@ oses a someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud across the country .
in particular , he was in particular al@@ ar@@ ming for the frau@@ dul@@ ent elections - from the older members of the Muslim community based pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the guiding principle to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as proof , pressure applied to needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities has been carried out in particular women and young people to elect members in particular according to the Will of El@@ derly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or Alban@@ ian background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions , such as &quot; politically correct &quot; , would have been ignored by &quot; politically correct &quot; regarding the eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
Sir Eric said to 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ist post@@ age documents are editing to stop &quot; re@@ ap &quot; .
the report that will be dra@@ fted by Ther@@ esa May in consideration for harder registration checks to prevent the voting catalogue is used to immig@@ ration and social purposes .
consider options to consider v@@ oters in front of the election according to your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person once she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person perform to ensure that they are voting rights .
a three @-@ year limitation on mot@@ ions to an automatic post@@ age .
ban , political activists , complete let@@ tering and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
the police provide authority to set down@@ s of elec@@ ting stations .
a Legisl@@ ative Change , which facilit@@ ates an Indi@@ c@@ tment on the People &apos;s Act of the People Act 1983 ( 1983 ) .
Phot@@ ograph@@ s offered in elec@@ toral stations .
request that only English can be used in the pol@@ ling stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees should generally asser@@ t that v@@ oters will go alone in the elec@@ toral cub@@ icle .
Sir Eric both fell over the Metropolitan Police and find it ast@@ o@@ unding , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case , no complaint was asked .
&quot; the elec@@ toral commission has Lut@@ as Rah@@ man and his deputy , for a lit@@ any and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; he said .
he was pleaded not guilty to the high demands in criminal proceedings due to a number of reasons .
he also critic@@ ises the most effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the City &apos;s Choice s .
Sir Eric said , &quot; The Court of jurisdiction in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our country is considered to be the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conc@@ e@@ aled spreading of sel@@ ections and den@@ ial of some authorities threat@@ ening this good reputation .

fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be on this week via the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot in addition to the edge and band that has proven to be impressive at the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one who has been fighting gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not to give the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio , and all the famous faces that are fli@@ ck@@ ering for the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ion@@ ic lists , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ masters .
the h@@ unter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from the sk@@ ates , many people on the Internet have referred to many people on the internet as a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after pictures where he looks at the wolf of Wall Street Star unbelie@@ v@@ ably looks similar .
in fact , the ar@@ cher given an ins@@ an@@ ity from the social media to hear that he had already heard of it since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a ben@@ evol@@ ent guy , so I don &apos;t believe it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will certainly no longer be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British distance Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes should go through a double @-@ singer for the Cuban American singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one step higher : this user is the opinion that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
a further improvement was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has similar eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver da@@ ff@@ in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova , the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , looks like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian von fans became a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
powerful women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that other simil@@ ar@@ ities like the simil@@ ar@@ ities of the simil@@ ar@@ ities
theory in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter User@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope is solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope is Solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar visual form and eye .

Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Does the C@@ BC @-@ comment@@ ator just said that the 14 year old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; died like a pig . &quot; ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot did not stick , that they were still on show . &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as described by the final 4 x 200m reduction for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with whom many questions introduced to him
Twitter @-@ User didn &apos;t think when they listened , how in@@ sensitive to Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter username in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us all look like razor . # adjusted .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast , was live broadcast live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald , saying : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a floating @-@ performance . &quot;
it was a un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , we &apos;re sorry that it happened . &quot;
at the end of more than 90 times , C@@ BC did ap@@ ologi@@ ze to people who have answered on Twitter
the commentary box Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
he copied and added his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we really regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible to broadcast them .
yesterday we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for our viewers on mission and our consequ@@ ent@@ less n in social media .
to clear one , B@@ yr@@ on comments are related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and a un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald also ap@@ ologi@@ zed to just@@ ify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the s@@ war@@ s@@ ling company in the C@@ BC Olympic turn , he said .
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to her as a person . &quot;
of course there was no confusion , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;

the buyer did not know where to see when a woman drew her clothing amid@@ st a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ ster@@ ed how she looked at it , moved her back into the shelf .

the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ est@@ one , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried his under@@ wear , &quot; she returned to buy and shop her business without buying something . &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
standing in the midst of the sales area , she took a pair of tro@@ users from the outlet , pulled her own ti@@ ghts and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a little more discreet place to do it - it was just there , che@@ er as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed as she with@@ drew the under@@ pants again , who obviously didn &apos;t love her , since she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other min@@ ions before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t feel anything , moving and r@@ ging again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; How can someone think any under@@ pants with home would take home a different person and who have not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I met , the staff tried to draw up the garments for sale after she left - which is exactly the same thing . &quot;
&quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of tro@@ users and find out that another woman had her back and did not wash . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident on Tuesday 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone .

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , in order to find out how to get up with armed rob@@ bers at the distance .
regardless of whether you approach from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ ber on the sk@@ e@@ wer .
when one approached them from behind , then you should turn off when you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and &quot; turn out &quot; out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder to face it with your free el@@ bow .
then strike it with the knee to the body and turn it down , while the att@@ acker might turn down because of pain . hit him by running your face and move backwards while they perform the weapon upon him .
at att@@ ack@@ ers , which approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , take the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then you turn the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and judge the weapon .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video in order to see exactly how it make Miz@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ power .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est hit by the saf@@ est thing for your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel Ian Wright goes off for a travel guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and th@@ ri@@ ef@@ lex of serious examination by resting some of the most poll@@ uted places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright ( 51 , from Suff@@ olk sli@@ pped off his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a jet@@ ty of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before moving any object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show itself and to show us what he is embar@@ ked on .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner STRE@@ N@@ GT@@ H , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea to stop the flush button of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , but may actually be dis@@ gust@@ ing , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr Wright with doctors and medical professionals talked about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health .
luck@@ ily , nothing left in his mouth more than a bad fo@@ ret@@ aste in the mouth .
Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world , and had a strange and magnificent stuff .
from public funds to train stations to jet@@ ting cra@@ p of toilets , the task put his immune system defin@@ ately under a sample
he told it in the film : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was appointed to his reputation .
the only thing he was rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ ver@@ ed line showed an umin@@ os@@ omet@@ al count of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ al number is freshly @-@ washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to leave , after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ al count amounted to over 4000 units , while freshly @-@ washed hands have a population of less than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner STRE@@ N@@ GT@@ H , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom .
in the movie he says : &quot; this comes to the worst thing I have rob@@ bed in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will stop here nothing because it &apos;s inside there inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner STRE@@ N@@ GT@@ H &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps master Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new .
something that &apos;s fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings through which we ended , that we told , &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in rec@@ tal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking only about the products we wanted to ask them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information in the consumer about an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he would have tast@@ ed some of the things that I had instructed him to lick it like the legendary Russian toilet , which will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian , to lick it and others , with which this was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 per cent of all survey@@ ed l@@ actic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine , and 58 per cent , said that they may use at least occasionally products containing l@@ actic acid bacteria .
social Family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation of Social Peace in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left its social reward according to a delay of £ 50,000 , because she had terror@@ ized her neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ ben@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their estate , the property of the apartment federation got the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls are lined up , wooden legs were rolled up , rub@@ b@@ ish was bra@@ ked on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated on walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is thought that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , which works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was not able to repair the apartment anymore .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I am the opinion that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , since this property is thought to be regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who had already lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which had added the family , in@@ dem@@ nity of inhabitants , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drugs and excessive scre@@ ams , stre@@ ps and flu@@ ff included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , was in June an arrangement for man@@ iso@@ ara behavior .
in some rooms of the house that will be demolished under circumstances , the age was found .
we have been traded in the property in which drugs have been traded in the past .
neigh@@ bors said they had to battle on the road and had to be called regularly by the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ated them and her partner this week viol@@ ently from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to be voluntary .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ing neigh@@ bors , who said that their lives were made to hell .
one said : &quot; They didn &apos;t get anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; we could not sleep &quot; today . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they finally are gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager from Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have missed the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long .
out of the over@@ grown side of the church house tr@@ ash and old toys was cast down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant said goodbye to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and to their family as a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
it was a very difficult case , as the behavior extremely was and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community that have cour@@ ageous to us and have provided information to us .
I hope that this development will deliver comfort to some neighbours , and the message convey@@ s that gover@@ ning behavior will not be toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .

workers from the house management now will have to we@@ ave a garbage he@@ ap which surround the house
in 2014 police led a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis and f@@ ather@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alien and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was a fine of fine , after she pleaded guilty to the possession of a drug of class B in trade respect .
they claimed that the money for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was who came in at a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without Ob@@ d@@ ach , T@@ anya and her partner now live in Plymouth in a private accommodation .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that she will del@@ ve ten@@ ants which will not stick to the house order
Angela C@@ row of the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall told , that the del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants which are not to comply with the house rules .
&quot; this is about those who have decided that they can be@@ have themselves without themselves , as well as those who have been damaged by such a way , &quot; she said .
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and religious conduct which continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

a portu@@ guese dive P @-@ 3@@ C Orion Air@@ plane of Air Force showed an incredible assault flight
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but persist@@ ed for no security risk .
this was the moment , in which the sc@@ ary tourists start to panic after an active jet on a full beach system .
dramatic video shots showed how the military aircraft were almost in reach via the sun@@ spots on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers arrived , as she under@@ stand@@ ably started to make wor@@ r@@ ying about the noise of the cer@@ eal drives , without seeing what the clouds came to them .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew extremely deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would abst@@ ain . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down upon me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were moved in panic as the plane came from darkness and flew incredibly low .
today the Portuguese Air Force pointed out that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deeply I needed that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet because of bad visibility is slightly lower than usual , but the air forces still persist@@ ed that safety was at no time at risk .
surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with which four people came to death at the island of Madeira .

Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with wor@@ ries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight for the first step in the new soccer season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the fight against the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sev@@ ille , the back@@ lash is coming three days later at the Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ man must refra@@ in from among other members of the Cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe @-@ League Champion , among others on Ne@@ y@@ mar who con@@ tests the olymp@@ ic soccer tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre is missing .
the German suffered a changing pressure in the workout , so that the entry request at Bar@@ ca was at least clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ ering Ste@@ ering in Barcelona for two years has been the number one since two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique presents this on a clear decision so far and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er Ste@@ ering can stand in most of the remaining applications .
before the first mandatory stop of the new season , there are doub@@ ts about the fitness level of the team that was hum@@ ili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
even at the 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convincing .
Sevilla in turn has suspected the 2 : 3 defeat after the extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and ende@@ av@@ oured the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with its eleven successes in this competition , Barcelona is the winner of its eleven successful candidates .
Ma Long in a &apos;s own league to ping @-@ p@@ ong Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Table football Olympi@@ ad .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old was defeated in Rio de Janeiro in a single final finale to his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) .
this is the ranking of the world ranking &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; winning the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mas@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it to the final game and made up the title among themselves .
so it was clear that for the third time a Chinese name would take the single title in the sign of five rings .
the last non @-@ Chinese on the top of Olympia was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left at the record alone , between sets and in time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they had with@@ drawn to the stand and had their shel@@ ters in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the mat@@ ches I have played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang had already said .
following the game played the gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly on one side .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year opponent in the first set .
after that , he took the pace at the record and left Z@@ hang down with a total of 13 points .
through the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma , not the expected joining match developed .
however , nonetheless there were enough stunning ball@@ ads to see .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the Bronze against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter , the White E@@ tr@@ us@@ can revol@@ ted against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ cro@@ ov in his quarter , and afterwards , in medical treatment , had to end &quot; ultimately &quot; with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ de Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and J@@ ör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become similar to the high table tennis age of Olympia .
Donald Tr@@ ump , &quot; massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional states their majority .
the Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump handed down weak@@ nesses of his campaign in the rep@@ ubli@@ can strongh@@ old in Utah .
a rare moment , in which the mul@@ tic@@ ular and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns , how correspon@@ dents reported .
after he has thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , the doubt continues to grow in his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to blame for false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed his famous media report .
rep@@ ubli@@ can high castles
Utah is usually a secure bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ or in June , Tr@@ ump and his con@@ pen@@ sion@@ ers were up from the demo@@ c@@ rats , Clinton and Clinton .
other institutes see cro@@ ump in the front , but not with the distance that are common to rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ S , tr@@ ump responded to the question how he wants to stop the cover of the Clin@@ ica again : &quot; as I did it so far . &quot;
and if you leave : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is , in the end , the political correc@@ t@@ ness does not reach it , be fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have led tr@@ ump , in order to eliminate the support of his suff@@ ocation , he should not present better fra@@ gment values .
instead of replacing the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans &apos; nom@@ inees will be stronger among the arms .

this was reported by the d@@ oping control Ken@@ yan &apos;s d@@ oping control .
the IA@@ AF world association added the IO@@ C to understand information about the case in order to ex@@ ert own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; the IA@@ AF exam@@ ines an assessment depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , &quot; was it in a IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and signed up when F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .

Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ ine master@@ piece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra conducted by Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; war@@ ms he .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have really enjoyed amber music in our blood !
in this stage , Bart@@ oli plays a older statue of Mary .
she re@@ members to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dancing .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because they are musi@@ cally outstanding !
and then Mari@@ &apos;s personality would be a personality .
she says it her song : &apos; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; it resembles me very much my Italian character , which I have as a Roman Empire , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
you see it in any of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; at the moment : &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot;
today , we moved to New York City and did not want to arrive to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful as that .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

the Kurdish community of Germany expects to short notice with tens of thousands of guards , coming from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could be some &quot; several hundred thousand , &quot; the president president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the hard over@@ h@@ aul of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan expected the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality awaits Germany a mass curse to Germany .
&quot; in short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of people looking for tens of thousands of people from Turkey in the medium term , if the Erd@@ ogan regime is fighting the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president &apos;s president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government passed Kurdish castles , over months ago , have covered 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run .
after the negle@@ cted p@@ utsch , a sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ al ethnic Turks were added .
many will begin new in Europe when they are further re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even absor@@ bs refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k .
the pro@@ band was accused of Syrian Arab citizens in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ ite cities .
with that Erd@@ ogan wants to increase the withdrawal @-@ back to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been wi@@ ped out or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member .
the pro@@ pul@@ sion of the government asked that the Federal Government correctly positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ ogan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erd@@ ogan @-@ critics are taking place .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement feared also the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
fire marking as Gü@@ len @-@ supporters destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics of professional existence .
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t suit and Erd@@ ogan sits on bur@@ gers , by the way , also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular@@ ists , said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ approaching Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Labour , the Turks already identified the largest group of political persecution by political persecution in Germany .
as of June 30 , this 11.@@ 3@@ 386 people and there@@ with almost 29 percent of all as as@@ l have been authorized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , there will be no violence against war , poverty , or in@@ som@@ nia .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by state @-@ legal side , individually persec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ en@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t pick up anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the di@@ alling Code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Central parliament decided in the beginning of the year .
because so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land competition - that &apos;s the bit@@ ing .
the locals who are to be convinced by the election players are on vacation .
the vast majority of tourists who are in the country , on the island of Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the natives , so they aren &apos;t allowed to choose the country .
these come practical problems : in the holidays we are hel@@ pers , infl@@ ating posters , infl@@ ating ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and end at the end of the vote .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final F@@ eri@@ day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again to let the people pass over to the colony .
the hot phase , when you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition to fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting , like heavy new@@ com@@ er AF@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co @-@ workers .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 government of government , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from its large posters .
he travels through the country , ro@@ ses ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it did his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , soul master@@ ing got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel on the nar@@ row@@ ness of the AF@@ D .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We create that &quot; I acceler@@ ates the rise of the right wing popul@@ ist , which will presumably cost him the beautiful ministry .
the CDU and its nick@@ name data , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced , as it is , when you make a wrong place at the right place .
she has invited Angela Merkel to grand@@ mother twice , the German parliamentary district is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Vorpommern .
&quot; this was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR .
but it is a pity that nobody can listen to other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CDU dis@@ covers largely on the usual market places and shopping centres with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
this , so , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also noticed that you om@@ al@@ ke the base on the country that she needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the times of the country .
the Council of the CDU campaign , Kok@@ o to his Mit@@ stre@@ l , is also self @-@ exposed : &quot; they have to go there where people are : Dor@@ ft@@ most , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
because much at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called up his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in surveys the social demo@@ c@@ rats were last with 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and just under the AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD still won with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should be able to jump on the farm day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the ad@@ versity ad@@ versity , and lay their election campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; is the leader Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green champ@@ ions give their search to search for local vocal ch@@ icks among tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the nick@@ named di@@ dat@@ in , bent straight with a house@@ boat in the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ands lakes and finds it even nice .
your impression : &quot; campaign in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : finding sites suffer from barriers
at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for the responsibilities of the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only at around 20 o &apos;clock , there are all@@ ot@@ ating pra@@ ises .
&quot; all they made pretty sh@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff is telling the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ model .
there is no default .
the construction site was transferred to the South at the end of October , until the end of October everything should be ready .
likewise , the opposite is responsible for the construction work , e.g. when it comes to furnishings of dom@@ ination .
since the construction site on Monday moved to the south and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the place rela@@ xes .
the citizens now can drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the car@@ ving traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partially substantial complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief manager Florian King .
local residents of Bach@@ el , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ nia had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sh@@ utt@@ les looked for and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks were mig@@ rated in residential areas .
since the speed limit@@ ing have not been maintained , the municipality urged to ampli@@ fy the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were significant survi@@ vals , &quot; says King , who himself pointed to the location on the spot .
they have been b@@ illed two to three per minute .
the free@@ way was at 77 hours of hour in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site went further , it was qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation has led to so@@ vereig@@ n@@ ty , everyone who asks you to look through .
but some are more and some less affected .
who has less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; so for other firms , it has barely followed for the renovation .
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z talks of an &quot; maximum slight decline , &quot; but also appears that of course the balance bike is missing . &quot;
the local along the road are explo@@ ited along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , Ow@@ ner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , First Crown , finds distinct words .
this is already threat@@ ening .
not only Him , but all the restaurants I met &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro .
the revenue decrease was &quot; far above 50 per cent . &quot;
the street theatre had its operation &quot; back for two years . &quot;
he has dismissed the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would react differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt acted on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if it could give up a financial compensation , the restaurant also benefited from the advantages of location on the B . now they also have the dis@@ advantages that yiel@@ ded by the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more generous .
in all ages , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest house will continue .
after all , the family business has settled since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the history of history .
for other regular traffic vend@@ ors now see less frequently , he can understand .
if you cannot get caught , it is also very nice .
that his ancestors fall back after the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doub@@ ts about it .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 works on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its inn in many years of history .
the construction of six months is brutal .
the IS is constantly bol@@ ted in the name of the counter @-@ terrorism .
according to the recent attacks , Secretary of Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère puts a thick security package .
but what does a ni@@ otic status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconc@@ iled .
all of his suggestions are &quot; politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior under the launch of his new security package .
they are asking anybody .
others , further points would be discussed first within the parties .
also , I di@@ b@@ bed myself .
but as interior minister , it was close to both results and a &quot; achie@@ vable con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the coalition .
following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presented a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but now the larger ones fall out .
a lot has already announced , announced , t@@ ilt : that a new security department is to take care of remote communication , is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on air@@ freight data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security agencies also does not come un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes a second stop for proposals to do so far with the SPD : he wants to con@@ serve men@@ stru@@ ation for terror@@ ists and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; grants the CDU man .
however , he kept doing this for reasonable and challenge nothing , which has no chances for the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas were presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
some of them are in themselves : he is planning rapid procedures for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more possibilities for dep@@ orting people from the dep@@ ortation .
refugees who are targeted to the country are to let their smartphone in advance and open social media accounts for a security check .
at Dul@@ ce for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers he wants to put some even worse than so far - about such an off@@ ences or deliber@@ ately disc@@ ard their identity to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legally holy .
some even seem to be im@@ balanced and open questions open .
and at some point - with the im@@ balances of patient , for example - arises the question : what does it have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between topics refugees and terror .
but it is not easy to say that the assassin@@ ation of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg have been refugees .
moreover , many people strug@@ gled about the high number of refugees concerned about security .
and things that had to be devoted to people now did not recover in campaign times .
the inner safety has grown enor@@ m@@ ously in the focus .
first of all the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ locking is great .
and yes , there are con@@ tours .
in the issue of internal security , the Union and the SPD can therefore increasingly stand in position .
in the past few days there was steep between the two parties .
only a gar@@ st@@ ical argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister , in which the departments also call for a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère th@@ ri@@ ves around con@@ cili@@ atory sound .
he is nothing from a return from a double pass .
we have enjoyed the discussion in Germany .
they are emerging , do not make sense .
and in a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition , he had constitutional objec@@ tions .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all the corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , only has to show itself .
there is a lot of things which could cause conflict .
but the SPD is trying to pro@@ filing an inner safety on the topic of inner safety .
party manager Sig@@ mar Gabriel is first used to will@@ ing@@ ness to talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still Volkswagen is able to pass through .
despite diesel engines , the shipping costs rise worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs all around .
in the recall of the call there is vor@@ tex around one term .
Volkswagen launches in the deliveries abroad in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to present a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , despite the diesel aff@@ aires .
but in July , the Volkswagen brand weak@@ ened especially in Western Europe and charged the total sales as it divided in the D@@ ax @-@ listed company .
worldwide , the VW brand was sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars and 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
sales in Western Europe alone , China &apos;s second most important market , sales up 14 percent below last year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany the deliveries around almost a sixth part .
CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann returned to the weaker figures from July , particularly on two business days , less in Europe .
in addition , the economic conditions of &quot; modified economic conditions &quot; have also been given in some core markets .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the UK vote thus deb@@ ated the withdrawal from the EU , explained a speaker .
in the United States , where the exhaust gas created first , a minus is also under beech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the affected house brand of Lower Saxony is continuing due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a reduction of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is under beech .
head of Corporate Finance Fred Kap@@ pler was able to report a sales pole from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen has control gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls for around 2.5 million cars to upgrade into workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
according to the conversion of the vehicles , it does not give any deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
the bus service to the customer after ref@@ itting a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; how it was named on Friday in corporate travel .
reason are legal habits .
the Focus &quot; had reports that Volkswagen now won his German customers a guarantee of en@@ du@@ ated diesel models .
this was confirmed last Monday VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
it was confirmed that this meeting was confirmed from the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; VW had completed the editions of my inquiry commission and the KBA customer . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the warranty that no reduction in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion had no deteri@@ or@@ ations and all type approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen self uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , please do not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund by the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich austerity measures in the future - as the second institute in Germany .
ban@@ quet Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who have 40 million euros on the sight deposit or the daily pa@@ edi@@ ble . &quot;
the Federal Association of German banks speaks of one individual and does not see any signal : normal savings would not be afraid , to pay for their austerity policy . &quot;
banks lend money over night to the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay a 0.4 per cent penalty .
this charge applies to Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September by priv@@ at@@ - and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight or discount price .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros is free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will continue to cost 400 Euro per year , &quot; Paul said .
for some time he kept EUR 40 million , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the others and which he could not utilize .
&quot; they are at my bank account and make a 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the chef .
&quot; I can &apos;t go down for a million 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
he now continues the costs for the dec@@ ay principle .
to leave the cash in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , it would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four cases , I do not like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers would have no understanding and change on other investments .
only a few emigrated to other banks .
the co@@ operative association Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing substantial costs in all banks . &quot;
it alone is not possible to carry , either &quot; effectively permanently &quot; . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ - and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg in 2014 had made head@@ lines with pen@@ dic@@ ular surgery for deposits from three million euros .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Banking Association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay Individu@@ als nation@@ wide empt@@ ying for deposits , the competition in Germany is too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is much lush from the property . &quot;
&quot; this can be a little bank for a small bank , &quot; if it is free money for free .
founded in 1911 , the co@@ operative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ refuse , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
living actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs live in the region .
there are no other banks known to the federation association Bavaria , &quot; announ@@ cing a budget set for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst .
the President of the Federal Association of German People B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to the Neg@@ ative , is very high , very high . &quot;
competition was tough , and it threatened the migration of gro@@ ans in competition .
customers in Germany will not let themselves have the bread@@ th in width .
dist@@ ination records : who really ys noise records ?
lonely men love middle ages .
before you hur@@ ry to rev@@ ise him under the p@@ seudonym @-@ n @-@ rate male &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the extensive resur@@ gence of sound boards not to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als who want to greet the curiosity of physical objects , but attributed to Mid@@ life @-@ nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are of all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer .
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ itter - it has an emotional meaning : older ch@@ urch@@ ers rather retain their feelings for himself ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , I would like to follow the camera in the midst of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest grey suit and a wild feeling like this : &quot; so , let us cast a closer look at it . &quot; so , let us take a closer look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look at it .
although the heart of S@@ oh@@ os is running slowly to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filled the buildings where the independent sales are located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record specifications .
I would probably ask the camera man to shift the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
stud from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of sister Ray ( s number : two young women , three men middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of men : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound boards , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I followed him not home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sin@@ gles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy them , when he was sold , when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early 70s , who was released when I was 11 or 12 . things to whom I was probably something too young to buy them &quot; says he says .
he agre@@ es to those who are buying records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at sister Ray , believes that many customers who hits you to get on You@@ go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media , people who have heard over their com@@ eback and have caused to buy their old plates again .
of the talks that I have led , people usually decided to pay attention to their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now , sell their CDs to buy them again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of the attach@@ ent of a record re@@ building of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ on@@ ica to realize that record business offers a soothing community of equality .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the previous clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some songs fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of trusted record cover , of objects , and happy it@@ ants .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or property of any kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; sho@@ ots out an employee of a record deck .
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people purchased a record last month they have not listened .
the pol@@ l also found that 41 % have a record player , which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of the report it would probably look very much worried as I pet@@ alled by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data count : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ ph@@ ies aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radio@@ head record so that I can put them inside the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musicians .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who only come slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound board almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I &apos;m going to be clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , te@@ ens and women of middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ed pop instead of Experim@@ ental Jazz dr@@ y@@ nt from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such a diversity in the clients .
none of them looks strange , but nail @-@ psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to imagine if you are standing next to someone over 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for several minutes and sees the variety of the plates flying .
it more makes a display bum@@ per as a big one .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore , the gathering of plates is not real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of lo@@ unges : urban outfit .
while I note the appearance of je@@ ans bite , I watch a group of young teen cities , which are devoted to a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left you find a staircase , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to handle it .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but in considering that any attraction for these objects signi@@ fy more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of S@@ oh@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , including that which is most for luxury objects like sheets .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they leave , at least in record shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collector and record holder that exist in reality , record shops and On@@ line@@ for@@ en , un@@ taken into account .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble@@ ed by the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves with plates , while she mei@@ ght dre@@ d@@ ess an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er , that didn &apos;t rise above the shoulders of middle age .

French court re@@ jects quot@@ ations on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , settled down .
in case of a court hear@@ ings this week , the authorities argue that the state should sell , sell 72 temporary stores in those persons , from cigarettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture also argu@@ ed that these places should be lower , because they would be paid to a parallel economy , which would not be paid for tax and risk of fire .
humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by the government supported association and other groups , do not offer sufficient food for growing numbers in stock .
they also carried out that the temporary shops and restaurants will often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the dism@@ iss@@ al of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais &quot; pre@@ fecture are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , caf@@ és and restaurants would play a much greater role to feed the &quot; live &quot; in extrem@@ ly prec@@ ed@@ itary conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet hits between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that were threatened by the low @-@ rep@@ ent was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which was shared efficiently and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice to asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the pet@@ ition to keep the Kids &apos; café true .
in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure is for those children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot;
the two Help organizations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants were estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle live have risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number now - after a steep increase of new arrivals in the course of the summer .
despite Olympia Rem@@ em@@ eption : Martin is hungry
despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance in the olymp@@ ic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to stop .
&quot; I keep going to keep the World Cup in looking forward , continue to be confident and fight , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday at his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have a declaration of his mis@@ erable twel@@ f@@ th place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; to me , it &apos;s very difficult to comment on yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he had to analyze them in peace , which resulted in the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time of the World Cup in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; I will look at all that we have changed over the last time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Be@@ am went to the start with his offer in January and has already sold more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also engage yourself .
for example , they can place missions and face enemies and provide equipment .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s breed must be set to the next generation of speed@@ ometers : in different German states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lightning devices are being tested , which should be more effectively over@@ due .
the futur@@ istic en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accidents , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on motorway construction or by rolling speed with temporary tem@@ bur@@ ners , there are often no necessary infra@@ structures , in order to ensure compliance with a stationary gl@@ itter for the observ@@ ance of the speed limit .
a durable mobile construction can however be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery holds five days in continuous measurement modes ; the fall data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
using laser measuring technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously via multiple tracks .
variable speed limit@@ ing as well as access to time , riding strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored .
in the highly experienced state , one can move the trailer by car with each car trailer hit@@ ch .
it is not simply sto@@ cked down , it is lowered in the measured mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and by the way also will disappear .
it is also supposed to protect a built @-@ in alarm system from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested for the data of Vit@@ ronic in different Länder and is now also used .
foreign authorities , including foreign authorities , re@@ juven@@ ated with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order out of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain over@@ takes silver in the 7 @-@ inch ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji master@@ ed Gold Class
the impressive performance of Britain &apos;s 7 @-@ inch ru@@ g@@ by came to a final stop at the final hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro stage .
Fiji issued a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , desc@@ ending , line and rocks to win gold - their first Olympics of any color .
the defeat was disp@@ at@@ ched by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize - Great Britain on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the obvious defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back in the final .
but , in this form , Fiji would not have beaten a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult road behind them .
eight years ago , it is lost to Ryan every game in Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this mud will hurt , but progress is ast@@ o@@ unding .
Fiji had begun wonderful and caused the attacks to be taken out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when one would run into running bus@@ ses . the World Series winners were 5 @-@ 0 upwards , above O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with four minutes playing game Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely took the ball .
a he@@ pac@@ ed t@@ ack@@ le from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone to att@@ ained a third goal , but Fiji only stopped to stop .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a ran a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the goodbye and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ formed a lot of weak sh@@ ack@@ lings of the GB team and r@@ ushed to the line to make a gate .
conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is like Fiji was not born to play the 7 , while UK still loses .
it is like that .
GB completed basic changes in half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ du@@ ic gap ... for quite four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half times , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Norton started a study for UK , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game went long in favour of the South Sea sul@@ ans , whose fans che@@ eks , b@@ anners and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ du@@ ff &quot; so@@ unded the Fi@@ j@@ is , and the UK , kno@@ cked down , kno@@ cked down into the grass .
earlier in the days , Fiji had conquered Japan in the semi@@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and the Great Britain hit the difference in a tight se@@ dition match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown already put the bu@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive foot work and scored a door among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant g@@ lim@@ mer of Marcus Watson , brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ seaside teams , secured a win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through fight with the cancer of the Train@@ ers &apos; cra@@ cker
there will be no engine charged with gold as they play , and this will be what you want .
from the first stro@@ kes until the last , 220 hard ho@@ ve that enters History , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams was there for the second Olympic champion in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , who took such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter is beaten , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins who are over the surface with the elegance of s@@ warf , which does not reflect the type of triumph@@ s .
behind each gold in rowing , a batt@@ al@@ ion of willing hel@@ pers are contribut@@ ing to the incre@@ mental progress which make the difference and there was no one more valuable than the trainer , which before 30 months did not know whether he was diagnosed this day if it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky what ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and did so .
if you do not do it , it is spreading everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky enough he could begin at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , so he could begin to keep the break at a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the correct word .
I needed money , so it had to go again soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in hospital and ran at station around - 20 feet , 30 feet to a time when they said that some steps were enough .
so it begins .
rowing itself is a challenge , but this makes it one even bigger .
in the in@@ ability of victory their first thought went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ gies in the morning , trying to talk little more than otherwise and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , the cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Art@@ illery Regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have a better person to train@@ ers or better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams started to start in New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; pale in the process , &quot; lasting in the process . &quot;
it is really important to let not join .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to do something fantastic .
we wanted no fireworks today , we wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
the Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure of Steve Back@@ stroke .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realise that I &apos;m a Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of complete clarity for clarity
the general manager of the Jud@@ ge of Water Association , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian . &quot;
a small hydro@@ con@@ ical drinking water association as a model for the great water producers .
so it was written some time ago in the original book in the book of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later the Water Forum re@@ acted the exchange of companies of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
the work of the church group gave &quot; Bavarian as an exemplary . &quot;
behind all that is Rupert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twin association , of which 28 years were as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose con@@ voy , located in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , annually fo@@ ster@@ ed around 15@@ 0,000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 villages and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , So@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water supplies for other cities and municipalities .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ns World Cup in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , was minded of that Rupert G@@ öller was appointed as a Wasser@@ wart company in 1988 and became Managing Director of the Pur@@ pose Association in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they asp@@ ire to work on construction and maintenance activities ; bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency response on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ person .
as outstanding events it called up the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of agriculture , the renovation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ organisation of water@@ pipes .
there was no halt whatsoever and one always received new features , because water was dirty and drinking water the most important food .
her Lau@@ d@@ atio praised her faithful , reliable and accurate service over 31 years away .
he was employed with much heart @-@ bloo@@ ded for his water ex@@ pe@@ er and he used to live down@@ right in general , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practition@@ er , he was able to present the nit@@ rate for nit@@ rate loss before the sub@@ marine of the sub@@ fran@@ ken .
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Rupert G@@ öller &apos;s hand praised Wasser@@ wart Alf@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years with him .
he is the best water man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the twin @-@ association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult action was the cane case in Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night , so that the loc@@ alities with water could be supplied .
it was also possible to maintain the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n once only , because you filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who will follow Rupert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko walks openly with the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turned to other affected parents : &quot; they must have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that they had to die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago had come down well and now be privately in New York , where it &apos;s the best therap@@ ist .
&quot; to give an example : if I wonder what happens two years ago , when I sang in La Scala , he reminds himself of nothing , &quot; said Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko .
but he is the most happy man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ re@@ b@@ k@@ os connection with the Bass @-@ bar@@ it@@ one Erwin Sch@@ rott .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ te@@ hei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday , shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ te@@ hei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday .
&quot; the man called himself with us and given to have killed his life companion , &quot; said a police @-@ smo@@ k@@ cher@@ in .
the perpet@@ rator may be on the run , after him will be publicly displayed .
now in the national , Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a gl@@ itter .
meanwhile , the police released a photo of it .
but it is a few years old .
meanwhile , the man we@@ ars a gl@@ itter .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in itself , so the police .
who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police talks about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck wanted to make no data to the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a child mal@@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; more we are not currently saying &quot; said a police officer in Lübeck .
the witness to the eye was a special police unit ( SEK ) in the crime scene .
steel - light view for the German steel industry
the explo@@ ited and energy intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from the oil @-@ cost promotion , are from the table .
it remains at the Liberation of Renewable Energy Production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore planned to ask the steel producers , the gases coming from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption , for cas@@ hier .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of € 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a principle of principle with the European Commission following talks with competitive Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in steel works , an EEG real@@ location of 20 percent is possible .
but these too will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall greeted the agreement in Germany with the European Commission to become self @-@ producing .
this will largely be recorded by the status Quo so far .
the successful extension of Gabriel is a special meaning for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel , the future &apos; is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow &quot; .
&quot; also in the reform of issu@@ ance legislation , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; explained IG Metall head Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and substantial pricing pressure .
last year , the situation in China exac@@ erb@@ ated more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel companies prize d@@ umping .
during this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
for one of the hands of imported import duties on import ste@@ els , the economic prospects in China have suspended itself .
un@@ clear is how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp lived carefully of the German industry priority Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp on Thursday .
last@@ ly , the prices have not stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to exclu@@ de the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers remain gently in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good 6 percent less crude than in the previous year as the economic association Stahl shared on Friday .
after a brief raise in May , the amount returned to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is set by two percent below the level of the previous year .
the association expects an improved company position in the coming months thanks to an improved company location .
community , Spirit , health : singing sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p es@@ cor@@ ted her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s school she did her subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .

after a rehear@@ sal , she feels happy , cheerful and more lively , she says .
she doesn &apos;t do anything else beside her health and mind .
for singing is equal in several perspectives , a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard Hack@@ ers from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in chor@@ us and share with pe@@ minded people the joy of music , describes Hack@@ ers .
by being regular , senior citizens can establish social contacts and maintain .
because often social and familiar structures remain at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , means Hack@@ ler .
for the elderly people train a deep and controlled breathing .
who calls his lungs regularly , does not get so fast from the pu@@ rest in daily life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at age , singing is an ideal hobby .
to elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Community of the Sen@@ iors Organ@@ iz@@ ers .
in the older generations , common S@@ ingen had a high priority value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening to songs by older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth life .
through song lyrics and especially melodies , demen@@ tia themselves ob@@ sc@@ ured for long rec@@ al@@ lied events .
when singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
especially older people who live alone so do not focus only on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through singing in the chor@@ us , means a h@@ ack@@ ler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em will also grow through singing in the chor@@ us .
to show themselves , if I have long for something , I will strengthen better and watch over me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to start singing with singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means little talent , betra@@ t L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - with 50 people who hear , who hears it when a sound goes right next to it ?
in search of the right offering , sen@@ iors have various options , says Hack@@ ers .
a person sing from the circle in an old mat@@ ory itself , you can just connect .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
many people you find also on the Internet .
if you have no access to the Internet , your family , friends or neigh@@ bors will ask for the Internet .
anyone who wants to sing should be in a chor@@ us , be@@ amer Hack@@ ler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for every age .
cats react sensitive as hang@@ over in scre@@ ams of the young animals
biolog@@ ists have explored in Hanover , what effect the calls from cats have grown to adult animals .
the male was not too cold for their surprise . however , they always kept the difference between the females .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ cher@@ y of cats by cats by cats .
they respond more to ten percent faster to lu@@ te of k@@ ittens that have emerged in great distress , such as scientists from the Hannover Medical School and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the calls of k@@ ittens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acou@@ st@@ ical differences between st@@ aff@@ s of less and strongly re@@ plac@@ ements for the males are either non @-@ perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke conv@@ ection by the MH@@ H .
it is the first to be published in the study published at this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; magazine .
in a previous investigation the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the Kitt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ ie with the ur@@ gency of her assistance was distinct .
a total of nine adult males and eight acts were observed in the fitting of the MH@@ H .
they were played for one calls for little ones , which were taken out for three minutes from the litter box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger k@@ ittens that were raised in addition .
researchers comply with their results in spite of the small sample .
&quot; all the females , even those who still have no own offspring , re@@ acted on the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned off faster to speakers , when this calls played a very nice k@@ ittens .
this ability may be an@@ born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in baby sounds .
some studies that women were sensitive to infants , whether they were mothers or not , did Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski interven@@ ed with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a soccer legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant had been issued for the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempt in Turkey , an important football game takes place again in Turkey .
prior to the du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ alen between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ is@@ ky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official route is clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already with the suspension of the exceptional state after the crash test in July , the government , the daily life of normal vou@@ chers should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
there is also no halt before football .
the pro@@ secutor presented an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
the sweet@@ ish group living in America is now accused of being a member of terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r should be tra@@ ilers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , made responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan .
although the emergency condition is initially valid for 90 days , it is still valid until October which actually has the life of most Turks , but as good as no effect .
Erd@@ ogan agreed on Wednesday for the night &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places throughout the country .
the sport is - like the whole land - split into followers and enemies .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , in view of dramatic experience in history , is the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
even fans agree - whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
with Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it is especially coming to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
in its sporty value , the Cologne in the last season was under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first time as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ her@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ fri@@ ffer .
the paper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered it : &quot; he was the best of the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured their cup .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting year for the record master took a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also leave off in the Europa League .
in the sw@@ l Li@@ g there was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; that is what we manage and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the game year was better for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season &apos;s buff@@ ers , as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g Tor@@ ro , was the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
while the treaty was signed by the AC Fir@@ m in Florence , the resident of Gom@@ ez managed to return to Mar@@ ik@@ tas , because of the political situation in the country after its EM holiday .
&quot; if Mario must come to us , he must only say , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
but the storms should be willing to give up some one @-@ third of his annual sal@@ low of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly presented : &quot; his salary in Florence cannot be paid . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have even medals chances in Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin had already been closed twice because of d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
others , athle@@ tics Men can only laugh about this - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic D@@ oping is determined like the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Jef@@ im@@ owa , which had lam@@ ented after a d@@ oping lock her start right shortly before the play was embar@@ ked and hidden in her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
it offered itself a quir@@ ky scene : she was stum@@ bled in the hall with a set smile and had prov@@ oked her appearance with her appearance .
when they decided that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a jub@@ il@@ storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who start the start in the Rio Olympics in spite of D@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was imprisoned for d@@ op@@ ings for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell the olymp@@ ic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is running even faster than before , he &apos;s number one in the world at 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest ch@@ allen@@ ger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fraser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m Rel@@ ax@@ ing / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down in 2010 after you have been demonstrated the pain of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery , she had a strong t@@ ooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Championships of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 have been positively charged on the forbidden stimul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ ing in@@ gest@@ ion and was closed for six months .
the four broad@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of big gold favour@@ ites .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positively and imprisoned for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement must have been responsible , for@@ cing Mer@@ ritt Power .
this year , the 30 year old is over 200 and 400 metres so far the fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lets were recognized as many medals .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to release Olympia @-@ silver 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 for testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a decision of the International Criminal Court of Justice in 2008 .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world ranking .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold favour@@ ites had only been tested in May , but may still be started in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year old world champion , references to the in@@ gest@@ ed dietary supplement have been found that the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand ranks with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early .
they suffered life @-@ w@@ ounds and had been treated in the hospital , but did not leave it again .
they are planning your home journey for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Phu@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on are also affected , be still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so bar@@ bec@@ ues .
at about 200 kilometres south of the city of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening on Thursday night .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ chan@@ gel was killed and about 20 people injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ soon went up two sp@@ lines again , but another person was killed according to the authorities .
Phu@@ ket also reported an bomb explo@@ de in the morning .
the Det@@ on@@ ation close to the popular seaside resort in Pat@@ ong has been viol@@ ated a taxi driver after police survey .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded which killed an urban assault .
according to the authorities in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al police , the demol@@ ition was gone into the air .
eventually det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on along the south @-@ eastern coast had several verses .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , the name of it was .
&quot; the bombing test carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ it@@ ag@@ early to journalists .
&quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
it &apos;s too early to express their mot@@ if@@ s - but it is probably the action of Muslim rebels .
Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern among the attacks , typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai Police stated on the other hand , the attempted assassin@@ ation and the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency Movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; it is only local sab@@ otage that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
rather , it is thought that the bombs ra@@ ged by the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have been sec@@ rec@@ y sec@@ rec@@ y evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact date and locations .
un@@ clear , which group is behind the plots .
the police reports their officials throughout the country to increase security about important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ use@@ ment parks .
in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in , there is a palace that was used for the years of Thailand King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason @-@ based bomb explo@@ sions the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recomm@@ ending on his homepage to do the instructions of Thai security agents .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applied for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ress and its surroundings .
it is not necessary to travel in these provinces after disputes between security forces and Muslim popul@@ ations .
increased risk of safety ( level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday have been posted a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this will impact the military great influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta @-@ chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs have been an attempt to educ@@ ate chaos , while the country gets moving towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had taken hold of power in 2014 after a Phase of bloody up@@ heav@@ al holds good to have led the kingdom back stability and order .
however , the military failed to get a grip on the military in the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict there were already more than 6@@ 500 people killed .
almost one year ago , there were also 20 people killed in Bangkok at a stroke of a popular Hindu shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the greatest attack on the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is to be constitutional by the Federal Office for Constitutional Affairs .
according to several provincial offices , the const@@ itu@@ tion@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have put under observation as well .
&quot; we see at &apos; identity &apos; movement &apos; investment for ende@@ av@@ ours of the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; said Constitutional Affairs Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ assed in extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of identity by ex@@ ag@@ gest@@ ing . &quot;
the const@@ itu@@ tion@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - ob@@ serves the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority have been closely aligned with the offices in the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &quot; identity movement &quot; try to pick their target group there , where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional manager .
generally , extrem@@ ists try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists as well as legal trem@@ ists .
this is no gu@@ ilt advertising for your own thing .
propaganda is supposed to stop the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
most recently , from several Länder reports about contacts of &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; to AF@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge about this .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in that case the AF@@ D - by certain persons , the most extrem@@ ist , varies and is so extrem@@ ist .
so crucial is whether such people have control over the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with a view on the significant increase of judi@@ cial off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have seen that there can be a gu@@ ardian structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ it@@ aler Group .
it may be quite true that further legal @-@ ror@@ istic group@@ ings or small groups represent the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee attacks or attacks from other righ@@ t@@ trem@@ ist mot@@ if@@ s .
a German @-@ wide or European control of legal gu@@ er@@ ism is however not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or social networks .
wor@@ ries were worried about that many attacks on account went to account of people who did not appear in the right @-@ hand scene before .
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the suspic@@ ious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were previously unknown against crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences that had previously been in@@ different with Legal trem@@ ors , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who have radic@@ ally radic@@ alised themselves by far @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic Games or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous performance by RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that it could not be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far from the section was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
at the end of the 24 @-@ year @-@ old , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his su@@ c@@ asser@@ ole and reserved the 59@@ th place by 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that drew attention to the international media attention .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start to the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in more familiar countries known .
as in ae@@ oli@@ op@@ ia the most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the lap quickly .
some media received him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
based on a &quot; bene@@ factors &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; made fun of him with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot;
his time he just struck a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle , there was no part .
compar@@ isons to &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ vel@@ vet provided the run of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
the appearance of the bu@@ ers of the squ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to run alone in a run over 100 meters of Freestyle alone .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old did swim eight months before the Olympia and had never had a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ et@@ s@@ ried - The owner of a Lad@@ in at the New Square has been sol@@ dered .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ et@@ s@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left its business on Monday before 17.@@ 30 and forget to close a window on the ground floor .
as she returned from the next morning at 8.@@ 15 hrs , the cas@@ hier was around 250 Euros .

dro@@ pping does not see the imp@@ ending choice of choice so narrow
the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks to the election campaign in Florida .
should there be nothing with choice for US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative vide@@ o@@ video .
he then will drive to your holiday .
loses the US presidential election in November , and it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it is either fli@@ pping , or I have a very very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in an interview with the US television channel CN@@ T .
if it is , in the end , the political correc@@ t@@ ness does not reach it , be fine , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he called President Barack Obama and the candi@@ dat@@ in Democ@@ rat Clinton , as founder of the terrorist group of Islamic State ( IS ) .
within its party , there was more and more resistance .
post is growing in the trade with electric transport
an electrical introduction car of Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is clearly big .
the Post plans to sell their electric vehicle circuits as well .
soon the Group will start trading with the transporter .
the Post wishes to offer its electrical transp@@ orters from the coming year , also on the open car market .
&quot; we want to climb to third parties in the sale , &quot; said a post speaker on Friday .
the company has been in testing for months whether they will be delivered by their own proprietary Sco@@ oter , to sell letters and pack@@ ets to other farms .
post @-@ board member Jur@@ gen Ger@@ es said , there is always repeated requests , about craftsmen .
according to information of the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; will shortly be able to increase the vehicles in mass production of the vehicles .
in the post@@ ing factory we plan to build up to 10.000 cars a year and layer .
Ger@@ es announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and pe@@ arly a complete switch to the environment @-@ friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will set the complete fleet .

G@@ FR@@ P leadership desc@@ ends after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company relies on leader Matthias Hartmann .
suddenly the withdrawal came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the tri@@ cky position of the market research company Gf@@ K saw that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is the more un@@ certain , lasting longer the achievements promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nürn@@ berger Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appo@@ inting business numbers and sign@@ ation of business management stands the global number five of the branch off a new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P Management Board wishes to leave the company at the end of the year .
Chairman of the Board of Gf@@ K @-@ Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already opted out of the supervisory board with effect from 12 September .
as early as September 1 , the management board member of the Executive Board , Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ cks@@ inger , has divided the company .
it is said to officially &quot; take over the function of a &quot; board speaking , until a successor to Hartmann was found .
the company called &quot; different views &quot; on the long @-@ term business @-@ olit@@ ical alignment .
details wanted a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will soon lead the market research company , be still un@@ clear .
on Friday , on Friday , on Friday , by the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment of the continuing success of the continuing success of years ago have been largely re@@ structured .
Mr. Hartmann is member of the Gf@@ K @-@ top since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it .
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business customers every shareholder will eventually become cal@@ m@@ ly .
&quot; if this would be the case at BMW , that would do the odds , &quot; it was called &quot; it . &quot;
the company had not yet able to stop its losses following the preceding quarter in the second quarter of 2016 .

accidents - Cy@@ cla@@ ve into hor@@ ror : eight verses
an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors as passenger cars were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ kli@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ i ) on Thursday for an accident of 43 sen@@ iors as passenger cars .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach forced to do@@ dge their data according to a opposite number , which was partially driven on the road .
the bus came from the road to the right and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speaker in the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus itself alone , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six lif@@ ter cars and a emergency cart came to the accident at the state road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers were brought back by a line bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ur district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there you should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load drivers and possible witnesses to report in the police .
the fees per cubic meter will be effective from 1 October 2016 for the area of the san@@ itation facility Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euro ( so far 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will be increased later , if appropriate improving measures are necessary .
after an excessive calculation of calculation the w@@ ast@@ e@@ water price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was as@@ cer@@ tained with the approval of the budget by the Coun@@ rat@@ ka D@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems run sub@@ caps .
the casino market is committed to legal foundations due to legal foundations .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial enterprises from the worlds of Directors , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg to lay down deeper into the pur@@ se .
fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt recorded the Panel , a new accounting for the waste management of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , even over@@ - and cover covers from the previous release period should be compens@@ ated .
the gra@@ zing fire offerings , Schmidt thus established it in all three se@@ wage systems with relatively small san@@ itation , that lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
due to the low distribution system , for example , expend@@ itu@@ res for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would seem serious .
w@@ ast@@ e@@ water supply is slightly dec@@ lining in all three plants .
furthermore , in the back@@ stage period , all three plants are not least incur@@ red because of their age and repair expenses in a considerable extent .
the grounds in Az@@ endorf are nearly 30 years old , the plants for the Me@@ ans , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Al@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to damage caused by damage in the Az@@ endorf area .
in the pum@@ ped storage unit the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and after almost 20 years of operation , the first sof@@ ten@@ ing pond had to be dispos@@ ed , and an additional ventilation option can be installed in order to maintain the water@@ tight dead@@ lines .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenditure , the continued care and maintenance costs came into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies for electricity costs which were significantly below the current level during the previous year of calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear , that at low se@@ wage in the three plants , expenditure for operation and maintenance &quot; were fully cra@@ cked . &quot;
on this occasion , Schmidt continued to have been spar@@ ed the market town of great entertainment costs in se@@ wage systems over the last 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to remain predic@@ table for the view of stone houses , especially since the supply of the se@@ wer@@ age of Fri@@ es@@ sp@@ acht@@ al can not be expanded to expand these facilities because it is distinguished by de@@ her@@ it@@ ational facilities .

snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as a Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
snap@@ chat tells that this filter is anim@@ e inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is incredibly sensitive to races .
with his filter tool , it enables us to alter about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already bor@@ dered to the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting from a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein .
the filters are un@@ b@@ los@@ som@@ ed , stand@@ alone tools that produce more than 30 million more rare per day .
all mal@@ tr@@ ates are to be addressed to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have been drawn in the past cr@@ iti@@ que in which they were accused of prop@@ agate the Black@@ face App or the white skin as beauty ideal .
as this week passed a filter , who gave them sl@@ ums , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics a ra@@ cial car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; j@@ aun@@ dice . &quot;
they asked whether these repet@@ itive top@@ usses indicated a major problem that the company has with diversity .
the messages and the ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after snapshots provided it would have turned off .
the company provided an exc@@ use : the filter was used as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ standing , having experienced rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us , the filter re@@ minded of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
some refused to draw the An@@ ime comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American student of art , whose twe@@ et was widely used on the photos that the filter &quot; imm@@ ac@@ ious and bund@@ led was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it &apos;s difficult to argue with the opposite of a very resist@@ ible Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter has not been secured , but that the yel@@ lowing of the shade has become extreme .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that they crossed the cultural heritage .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration battle , of conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment that we all hold in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great crowd of young people - which are similar to race of several characters as their older counter players - could rather expect to expect sen@@ sibility .
if one of snapshots are generated such a picture , so it is much more difficult for a user , &quot; so it was much more difficult that such matters remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu went to collabor@@ ate as a product manager and engineer for media to er@@ adi@@ c@@ ate their Snap@@ chat accounts , and asked for others to do the same .
in a discussion for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that ra@@ ci@@ ally @-@ related controversi@@ es would reflect a lack of diversity in the experience practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the great part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they do not have various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint which has largely un@@ answered to the Snap@@ chat .
the company does not publish numbers on diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as private enterprise .
on Thursday , they refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently set up a HR officer that focuses on sub @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu saw that she is locked up their Snap@@ chat accounts , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military govern@@ ance on ISIS services Information , Com@@ mem@@ ori@@ ze the Congress of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command revised ordin@@ arily to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic state in Iraq and in Syria as it would have been allowed to report the actual conditions of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force the rep@@ ubli@@ can members of the military commission , reported by great dis@@ content among Central Command Secret Services c@@ ysts , reported how su@@ peri@@ ors reported their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; message @-@ service information given by senior Cent@@ Com Commander in typically a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have been allowed to share the actual states on site and were thoroughly positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers will be present if bad analy@@ tics are presented by our policy leaders , &quot; asked Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the Repres@@ ent@@ ative residence .
the Cent@@ Com activities range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that Obama given instructions to change the reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts were exposed to pressure from their counter@@ laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions , and statements before the Congress had clearly positive than compar@@ ing the facts . &quot; the report was established .
for example , Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military return from Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the peak of Central Command introduced the down@@ turn reports to shut down the risk by ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after they were admitted that anal@@ ysts agree with the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge during the investigations .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com accounts are going through the general inspec@@ torate of the Ministry of Defense .
Democratic Members of the News Service Committee published their findings on Thursday that agreed on some of the conclusions of the rep@@ ubli@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created a revised process for creating retro@@ evaluations on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; was announced as a member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. , in a statement of opinion .
this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the publication of divine service reports , &quot; proclaimed the mor@@ als under anal@@ ysts and &quot; excessive little room for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ c@@ rats gave no notice to having found some evidence of the White House at Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts on a &quot; certain political mind &quot; .
preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; on Tuesday .
in August , the New York Times reported by the Pentagon &apos;s Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , admitted to complaints from Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment the Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor would still be underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have set@@ backs on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alle@@ g@@ ations of last year have rejected the question , although President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest inclusion of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the Islam@@ ist state remind us of the torture of more than ten years ago , when an Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , was described as a small occupying force in Iraq as well as a little while on the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts , looking at the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker announced that Mr. Hoo@@ ker had no significant impact on terrorist attacks against the terrorist affairs of the terrorist group , since these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had been put into operation , since these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had been put into operation , in order to sell oil on the black market .
but this finding was not published , the Times was reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the Legisl@@ ative Council due to his excessive positive assessment of the war on a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the Ho@@ ckey of Women , a show@@ down with great Britain .
a day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not belonging to people who keep their goals in mind .
however , she knows that : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are even in their group with the British on the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after her 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
the United Kingdom and the United States will succ@@ um@@ bed on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place is placed a little longer in the path that will lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a hockey stick in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 in which she went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things into better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the workplace in London , which we now have .
we have completely dis@@ rup@@ ted the ru@@ d@@ der .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the g@@ entry in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
India was without victory in the game , but the team showed a surprising and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until the game took place in their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and invited the ball in the gate to obtain a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
as well as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game .
in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and stri@@ ving .
it is when the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is lo@@ op@@ ed from the wrist@@ let to the Turner of the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a paper or listen to the coffee in the queu@@ e without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ec@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ ling with dimples , should have been shown below this well known name , built by sponsors and feel TV advertising where he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even Fe@@ eders .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame is not illuminated every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade , there are sports which are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the breast@@ feeding and may have long reign .
but if I do modest arguments in my particular favorite should make me di@@ vert attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been an Olympic event since 2000 , the last 16 years had noticed so many people that I had question@@ ed , it didn &apos;t know that it is an olymp@@ ic event at all .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA got the competition for the competition , it has never gained a medal in jumping and has had a athletes who had made it for the final round of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans who share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping is a certain out@@ sider , partly because it sounds for the un@@ en@@ lighten@@ ed ear matching for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ ist@@ ical potential - the cart@@ o@@ onist trem@@ bling of his never @-@ reaching up@@ swing - but also the charm of the gym and past@@ ures , the two sports which essentially joined them .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; is from the Spanish El Trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
rising conqu@@ er@@ ships jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ ues and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
they are assessed according to the official olymp@@ ic series after accompl@@ ishment , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in the Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest to go forward to gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground .
they do not chase only the finish line or the main wall , but in the television broadcast an additional Croatian objective : the world or the Olympic ords .
the targeted stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic , and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I think about watching these games as something exhausted .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she sto@@ op@@ ed , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ os as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly upwards .
there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant im@@ min@@ ent of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be played at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming for 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of Olympia @-@ mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably over@@ see in general tum@@ ult .
when the increase of consciousness can be achieved only by the proc@@ ure and object of male athletes - as it struck the male US Turner , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his flying , new fan community .
&quot; a generation of Protestant &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demon@@ strat@@ ors who demand political changes in Ethiopia are based on violent protest against the government .
witnesses test@@ ified that the protest@@ ers were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at Sch@@ uss@@ ani .
is Ethiopia just watching it ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid part of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook off the country and expanded it in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and requested fundamental political changes .
according to human rights , the response of the government was un@@ merciful .
witnesses indicated that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on some armed demon@@ strat@@ ors .
in circulation , videos include the protests , presumably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now requires an incoming inquiry .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this land again and in future , it will even be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa the International Crisis Group , one research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get as much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in considerable speed .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new pend@@ ul@@ um in Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba capital .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - Human rights organisations have continued to supp@@ ress the op@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , with dis@@ si@@ dents needed to silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wi@@ den@@ ess of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; when you press people and they don &apos;t have any other options except to protest there , &quot; said See@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth were protest@@ ing .
one generation is protest@@ ing .
there are numerous dis@@ comforts that cover everything from the ground up to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of ruling coalition .
following an extensive election of last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the final seat of the opposition and now 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time the ten@@ sions go along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this controversial line under@@ took hundreds of lives in June .
anal@@ ysts believe that separ@@ ati@@ sts as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were in the last years more or less forced to use the tur@@ mo@@ il and re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of dist@@ or@@ bit@@ ing after years of inf@@ an@@ kl@@ es under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smart phones were increasingly more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government stops the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , particularly in protests , many people can still communicate across the Internet pro@@ x@@ ies where they can stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they were so gathered to protest .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ co@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest her@@ nia in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ co@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
since Ä@@ ons prosp@@ ered the am@@ har@@ as , that come from Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ia mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , as they explo@@ de the Oro@@ co@@ es , many of which are Muslims and live in flat areas .
but this too changes .
&quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ chi have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by un@@ fair members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for around 6 percent of the population , dominant in intelligence , in trade and politics .
the third reason for turbul@@ ences is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death in a widely publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tic gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was especially committed to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and to use special officers to work opponent and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict of conflict .
Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ le@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively in@@ transparent grounds to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ le@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands against elections , which had apparently been adopted by the government according to analy@@ tics , was subsequently stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ v@@ ants many protest has been killed , even if there were fewer than in the past months and that time of turbul@@ ence ran relatively quickly .
development experts from Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new pend@@ ul@@ um of infrastructure , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty ab@@ at@@ ement .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ art of Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethics .
last month , Protest@@ ants held in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ an city , run by Tig@@ ray and the h@@ ass against the Tig@@ ray becomes more common in social media .
anal@@ ysts say that the protests are bringing the U.S. and other western allies into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
Ethiopia also used the American government as a basis for d@@ ron@@ eous flights over the neigh@@ bors Somalia , even though it was recently agreed that it closed this basis .
while the West will definitely want to support democracy , he does not want to combine his ally in a vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin congratulations . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim to Obama was founded on ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign filed repeatedly , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions concerning the communication skills of the presidential candidate , whether he be able to communicate clearly and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fel@@ lows , which ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase of protection to explain which he might not have meant that he could not meant .
after having made a statement on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump threw back in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and was in interviews to suggest that he really didn &apos;t intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help we@@ aken the statement ref@@ usal to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the rep@@ ubli@@ can candidate does not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que came down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign for falling issues on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
being aware of Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher tax and found her speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he went on strong criticism , as he supposed , the Russians should su@@ ing Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but he said later , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic borders in politics and then back to recru@@ iting demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how to get certain messages from his fans as they arrive , and then where appropriate , &quot; said &quot; according to what is reaction . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication cable that observed the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the Presi@@ dential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump led an even more corrosive tone , as its revers@@ ing declined to decline .
a new pol@@ l by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , showed a guided tour in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump seeks not to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative declar@@ ations , he often accused his critics , to mis@@ use his statements and to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is reinforced during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal Mit@@ stre@@ l into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements must be .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent adv@@ ances , was able to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , so he said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had created the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it background b@@ anners , completely false and hence it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ ream rep@@ ubli@@ can try to argue that Mrs. Clinton served as an outdoor minister , ISIS allowed himself to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control .
before his election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump put his attacks on the media and cast them back on any of his words and be pre@@ occupied with him .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , j@@ ump@@ y &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t know ! . &quot;
some of the demo@@ c@@ rats wi@@ ped over Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s exc@@ use as merely a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once p@@ ushes the price of the market , Café comes back green@@ point
de@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ out café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay a Wi @-@ Fi for but 15 years of good coffee served .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ der &apos;s front was pushed .
the store of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , depos@@ iting in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people managed to be the last loss in a remote European city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is change , then it is also new .
revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened its last November in green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client was offered to provide money for a new outer place , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot .
ver@@ b used the same distributor for excav@@ ations bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it uses even the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and saut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural dis@@ arm@@ oured .
the café offers no beer , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a busy stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers have also been displac@@ ed by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg so@@ oner and attended the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she had moved to green@@ point , she would take the way .
having closed the ver@@ b , she gave a short rehear@@ sal for a while , she said .
&quot; I became clear that the coffee and the culture was a ver@@ b that I liked , &quot; she said .
now they drink coffee , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea in this day , instead of their usual cold coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the de@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and kept un@@ inev@@ it@@ ably the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no anger over , that the soap firm has taken the old business room .
indeed , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie used to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the coffee tree coffee of the coffee .
&quot; I think we will go down to their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional Polish residents of Green@@ points also accepted the Café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said he will show them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has other benefits .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold me@@ ager coffee in bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expan@@ sive on an adjacent building .
a new Ver@@ b is enough for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was regular and said that he was destroyed by the ground , when the coffee was closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that joining the Lok@@ as and the Order felt a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the depres@@ sive food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office .
for f@@ oo@@ dies , President Roosevelt was a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined refin@@ ement at Fifth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mar@@ yland Water@@ proof soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ bri@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; she was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ians .
the last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was written by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a home in the Lower East Side from the perspective of food .
her latest cooperation , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the story of the American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , put a fresh che@@ eses with olive oil while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key , with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when repor@@ ter finished Hack@@ ney , this found the couple of discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ bri@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , meat lo@@ af and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap , extending the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ est .
&quot; he has to have put oneself in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
in front of the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet .
teams of women co@@ ves for male colleagues and it was served fresh baked pie for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans that sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the roads with which the country went on to be no longer the Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne .
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans a central , united topic , &quot; promised Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
similarly ten@@ se was the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and K@@ asser@@ oles became basic food containing the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ mark food , as it could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a thick sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American kitchen for years , has become a rarely pre@@ serv@@ ated luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mixing were tested , as a cal@@ orie and nutr@@ itious satisfaction had priority in front of taste or even healthy food processor .
during her research for the book , which includes recipes , brick houses prepared a dish from this era , fried onions , pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t a popular additi@@ ve at the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Z@@ bri@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit together .
it was typical for many of the laundry recipes .
as never before or since then , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated bud@@ gets - including Louise Stanley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country der@@ less .
in order to make recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become bud@@ get@@ ary sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic delic@@ acy .
especially tasty are the reports of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peas@@ ant kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke about the millions of millions in the world from which he has become .
&quot; he liked a continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a very g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and got a smo@@ king .
he was a glorious alien .
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake , when not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute a stamp with his stomach .
as described in the book , one house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House prepared the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most tro@@ users prepared . &quot;
many of the species coming from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected once the country returned to her legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said bricks as well as science was applied to foods .
the couple offered to have better understood the eating habits of the bri@@ ck@@ ery in law in law - for instance , how food could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
brick you remembered : &quot; they did actually make people ill . &quot;
there was the wind blow .
after the plates of Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were evacu@@ ated , they moved and co@@ es out a dessert , which they had dressed in the home : the pl@@ um , which was forming Roosevelt .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Z@@ bri@@ man and added that it was a common trick to give you a nice name .
there were no proposed cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody encounter@@ ed something re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly to t@@ ing@@ le a spoon into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly it was not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a night .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ap@@ ason he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs hit : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he made his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar wid@@ owed his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a bombing attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group , which has so far spent nearly 6@@ 0,000 people in the newspaper .
29@@ 00 volunteers expos@@ e their own life to the game to move people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide the first aid in the war area .
they are heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of a civil gu@@ ardian that shows him from the w@@ reck@@ age of a house with 11 hour b@@ ail@@ out of a house , and went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the shining symbolic figure in the hor@@ ror of the war .
as heroes he had never seen himself , according to the picture , &quot; for me it is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before he fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the hel@@ oc@@ op@@ ter have cast four Fass@@ ben@@ ches on the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from asthma .
&quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of bomb that no children play with it , &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died .
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Grön@@ land shar@@ k : the oldest sp@@ ine is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k went back to the sea after a research on board the ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swimming with a good 1 km / h across the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land shar@@ ks receive only with 150 years of offspring .
the Grön@@ land shar@@ k flo@@ ats on the ground of the North Atlantic coast , in an hour he comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
just when it really counts , acceler@@ ating the five meters long beast up to 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this lifestyle appeared from long @-@ term , but seems to be a bul@@ let for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case , by a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ rub@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this life span , which means for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates a world record .
indeed , the Evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist expected long , that Grön@@ a ha@@ ie are cob@@ alt .
only the evidence was lacking .
Grön@@ land ha@@ ie are hard to observe , last@@ ly they live mainly at the polar sea in the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear in the winter on the surface .
according to the lifestyle of the Grön@@ land ha@@ ie we know correspon@@ d@@ ingly little .
you have drop@@ ed your time when they chose six animals with a broad@@ c@@ aster in front of the top .
this shar@@ ks are nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
you may chase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for Kad@@ aver , the water layers below .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 of it was 502 .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method to the lens core of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens is already being revi@@ ved before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which are not renewed in it later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had striking a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons try to kill larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in contrast , at 220 c@@ tim@@ eters long , the len@@ tic@@ ore contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all the larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their len@@ tic@@ les , which occur through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ tim@@ eters , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
the Grön@@ b@@ hai @-@ females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters may well stand on the threshold to sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Grön@@ a shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication clearly become at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
to live such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme , especially in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Grön@@ land cow , in whose bacon , baked a 120 year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was captured before Alaska .
because of the low temperatures often the organism living animals are often living on spar@@ flame .
so they grow later - and grow slower .
to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also very large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal is ir@@ oned .
the thermal loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than at a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants possible early as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ ure@@ lein .
a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building material in double pack

with a relief , the Panel looked up the release of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of recently designated residential bands can begin . &quot;

in order to en@@ res@@ ett@@ le other commercial operations , linked to the creation of jobs , to come up , the Municipal Council decided to change the bottle plan in partial areas of this year until the spring of this year .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
that is why the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies in London , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is likely that Frankfurt have benefited most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ner , head of the Compet@@ ence Field Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is unlikely to continue to operate any monetary policy from London in the EU &apos;s financial transactions .
approval in the UK so far is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU @-@ pass .
they just use great US banks .
several banks have already announced to store jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs at the Main in five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the registered office of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is responsible for monetary policy and over@@ sight on the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities like European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Consult@@ ant ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , however , is less important for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ner .
in Luxembourg , a large fund sector is occupied , but also as Dublin return in infrastructure .
thanks to its large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
further points of the city with easy access to commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not that easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ner .
on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate property are 50 percent higher than the Main .
moreover , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the business consult@@ ancy Mer@@ cer the town stood at square seven , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin at No.@@ 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ference : &quot; Frankfurt would attract further banks and investors with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market . &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe .
the correlation has also spoken : in London , according to figures of the Landesbank Hel@@ aba , in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepat@@ itis C patent lit@@ ig@@ ation with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. federal judges decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal cost , that you came from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from damages amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead stood , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ a and other un@@ ethical deeds .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US state mag@@ ist@@ ion Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead belonged to the cost of the costs , which were created during the defence of the law .
Mer@@ ck tries to con@@ serve with Gilead , which is dominated by the market of a new generation of hepat@@ itis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .

Clin@@ tons win 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
on Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton posted its tax statement for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a revenue of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton generated a revenue of USD 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister generated a revenue of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book in ministry of ministry .
Clin@@ tons &quot; candidate for Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax returns with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton over the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ ag@@ list@@ hel@@ per Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ s in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump cover@@ eth behind false exp@@ editions and in relation to his hi@@ ther@@ ing promises to publish his tax returns .
there is custom@@ ary for US presidential candidates to post their tax returns , although they are not obliged by law .
as a reason , Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man and his lawyers have stated a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian SA@@ MS on Twitter , in relation to the release of the presidential candidate in Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ ump special advis@@ ors said to CN@@ N , that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before controlling the control tests .
Tr@@ umps critics , among others also the rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already published that his ref@@ usal would have issues relating to assets , his business needs and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton already over@@ threw himself on the subject and posted a video on the Internet in which his Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have to report his tax returns .
on Thursday she spoke the topic even during a speech to the business in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish its declaration of tax . &quot; she said to the crowd .
POL@@ IC@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or not only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax collectors and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a subject in election campaign .
Clinton supports a settlement that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , that would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ kshire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate has required his seat to exchange too much at their tax returns .
Buff@@ ett also said he had under@@ gone a tax test of the IRS and Tr@@ ump &quot; fear &quot; in front of the v@@ oters and not before tax authorities .
the Obama &apos;s campaign has released tax returns to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , is on average a effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax declared of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that these only USD 100 their income as a salary , different from the majority of all Americans .
its main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds received USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ ard Foundation , which had already been an idea already years ago , trained with the U.S. natural protection and strengthened its funding in villages in the north of Tanz@@ anian , to use a non@@ violent method to protect their houses and harvest without sacrific@@ ing animals .

Jewish director defe@@ ats Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ selection was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; so@@ lic@@ itation &quot; - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media release after he had betrayed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , since the Arab guests have called for an employee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the list of hotels .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
writing Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol provides a possibility to choose Israel to an own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; how Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , triggered many more anger in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ ians and they have requested that the selection process is deleted , &quot; was cited by Lanz@@ mann .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ trading man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ fig@@ ured by this event .
this is really very embar@@ rass@@ ing .
the fact that this has worn into exactly this hotel chain in Germany is even greater shame .
no explanation requires that .
we expect the hotel &quot; draws the right conclusions , &quot; said the ministers .
the incident solved a rather big reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some submitted to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it could have been &quot; the alleged &quot; Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly denied all the alle@@ g@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; see , &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror .
&quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; that Israel did not take up in the spr@@ ing@@ time list , &quot; quoted the southern German newspaper a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds , the country code has now been added .
police places Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ raine against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students strug@@ gled together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police , when they were gathered to demonstrate the reforms of the government for public educational system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber assault against demon@@ strat@@ ors .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to spread the students , which led to the police , Gum@@ mig@@ raine and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the proposals of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo , Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protests could see Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the provis@@ ional president Michel T@@ emer on walls .
the latest protests occurred several days after demon@@ strat@@ ors went to the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ sive President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been reli@@ eved from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ hag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teh@@ eran at the same time , rose by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent in the year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , the interest in sites of Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador allowed them .
Russian companies established existing connections with Iran , while new firms are ready to provide access to the market .
naturally , the further commercial building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ hag@@ ar@@ yan .
it realized that the trade rate between Russia and Iran saw in the first five months of 2016 by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million in the same period .
in particular , the Russian imports climbed by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade break was achieved by deliveries of machines , engines and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador .
D@@ z@@ hag@@ ar@@ yan goes to Russia for this year , a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian colon@@ ization consisted of some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily in Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , on Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the tourist resorts in Russia .
you could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken by the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something of which the ambassador hopes to change it .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

the ministers from the pastoral care unit of the Ey@@ ep@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on a walk on a four @-@ day walk from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were made .

Scot@@ s@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms right at home , as Br@@ it Gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner most recent evening in the men &apos;s team @-@ spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y took himself to E@@ igen and made the legend hau@@ gh@@ ty when he was going home to enter a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in London , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys , in London .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when it appeared .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man , with whom they stayed when they witnessed potential in the vill@@ i , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ d , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y Victor@@ ious - and Sk@@ inner set a Olympic champion in qualifying rounds , but in their stand rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ d was just back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team in front and Sk@@ inner .
a change of strategy made a major part of transformation , with the execution of a higher gear to slow down and make it Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as the BBC expert , Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ d fell as they climbed on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name .
we placed an Olympic champion in the final round and conquered the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der announced that he fell straight into the track after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no ob@@ jection from England Riv@@ al .
there was no such problem with such a victory .
he said , &quot; The whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand will feel like London . &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we came so badly with so many world titles that it was amazing to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ ys , it is in the range of possible that he repe@@ ats the victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on the 23rd of March ( a seem@@ ingly holi@@ stic date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which will start today and will go for three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels too lonely to win alone .
he said , &quot; If he wins two gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts in the day , but there were still good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the World Record , won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first round of the competition will take place on the second day of the competition on the second day of the competition on the W@@ ig@@ gins .
he fought yesterday with preaching , when they called the officials to measure his body size .
in the event that will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura dra@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Arch@@ i@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world records from 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong platform team to domin@@ ate the central period of the Olympic Games and to take a band on medals .
after a truly exceptional display of absolute dom@@ ination in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio fell down .
it also played out in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton technical leader in April , amid@@ st sexual muscles and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ es , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , as it could be a legendary call to meet the perfect moment of reaching its cul@@ mination , again .
future of melt from Portland , based on the up@@ lift of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - stand in the game since the system operator will cancel the energy supplier and thus proc@@ laim all delivery agreements as provided by the energy companies .
this step followed the decision by the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to be put into operation .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years exp@@ ires in November .
there are up to 2000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland line of the game .
not less than 2000 jobs direct and indirect - may be at risk for a closure .
in addition , it could occur too dom@@ ino effect , as the melt around 10 percent of total electricity generation Victoria is consumed .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point Henry melting , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ian power plant last year .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the year @-@ long spec@@ ulation in the future of the plant , originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium scra@@ p with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe , spread out that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is located in a majority owned by AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina from which the Chinese Company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland , which means a further physical demand for power through the melt , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L continues to announce that the Tre@@ aties were so called &quot; backup transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force as of November 2016 .
the tre@@ aties have a 12 months notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the business year 17 may contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity suppliers .
all potential impacts on AG@@ L &apos;s income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale and retail prices .
AG@@ L shared that it already subscri@@ bed the value of the contracts to an amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expecting a termination . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties to power the Tre@@ aties of Alco@@ as ... to operate the melt and to guarantee the power supply of the melt . &quot;
the U.S. company said that it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still another statement , why it has with@@ drawn from the contract .
anal@@ ysts were war@@ n because of the bad economic conditions of the branch before the possible end of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the anal@@ ysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland would consume around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts .
in case both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us , it would not be good for us , &quot; he said .

this represents virtually every birthday episode of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ ant brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a character set at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls play any of this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with safety .
B@@ ander@@ a large sister Kim might have liked what the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were supposed to see this in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine issue is a league for himself .
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference which resembles a picture band than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista which were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the panel ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unve@@ iling of its Co@@ ver@@ stars is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine le@@ ak@@ age before the official announcement .
Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s already cover the cover already on their cover .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities , the mo@@ wers &quot; than &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Jennifer &apos;s lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - under the former category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good snap@@ chat video ( even if it is hop@@ eful about it ) .
they are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , was published by the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade in one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers doesn &apos;t like success anyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues were Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the Mist@@ ails of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings re @-@ rehear@@ sed once again , when the message came with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the f@@ ow@@ ue cover .
but seems to ride along the mist@@ rust seems to passing on the point .
Kend@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
it is sold by her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the LOVE magazine .
and in her free time she is visible in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
communities propor@@ tion@@ ate 1,@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the most common areas of the country are identified every year by the congregations of the country , while the sector is committed to the impact of other mid @-@ ab@@ brevi@@ ations .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and similar , are referred to for free legal advice and legal services .
legal services in the community that are already moder@@ ately established are prepared for further reductions .
as of June next year it is fore@@ seen that further 30 percent of its federal agents will lose .
the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell ten@@ ders , that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res resulted in tens of thousands of people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land communities were divided into chron@@ ically , meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need must be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and impressive debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal kind and this survey shows that they could not receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will sh@@ orten its funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of hi@@ de@@ generative people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to comply with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the General federal pro@@ secutor and the Federal Foreign Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to raise such a short@@ cuts so that people will need help to get them under legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to take funds on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the communities and their customer community as well as that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey to country @-@ elections : SPD and CDU lose
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the heads of government of the SPD and the CDU .
this is a representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could continue to reg@@ ate , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to keep the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD reached from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the pol@@ l , the party is only slightly ahead of the CDU , which could rise to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and AF@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the AF@@ D would represent by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
despite a slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ it@@ ated with 6 percent ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) once again in the Sever@@ e Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Parliament with 3 percent each .
according to the Berlin dep@@ u@@ ties , only 23 per cent ( 2011 election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) in the survey came to a survey .
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
thus , it still sm@@ iles behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would be represented at 14 per cent for the first time in the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would like to miss the entrance in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
online e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator was launched 20 years ago .
today , the successor domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer had a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was quite bul@@ ous .
initially , the built @-@ in memory was eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would range today for about two rare ones with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; was born exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the business and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros lovers can buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the age @-@ era of the newspaper age .
however , 20 years ago , Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker had previously announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; office in Western Europe . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the time standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received by fax , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was too high .
even access to websites was possible with HTML browser , al@@ beit slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen were found .
the price was pretty proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , for example 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euros in 2015 .
no one could guess that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era in August 1996 .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile division of Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented disaster , was eventually sold and managed on Microsoft .
today the market domin@@ ates suppliers that all came a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere be online , that is today for a lot of people everyday .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion devices have been sold , Samsung and Apple are around 555 million units .
global turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these are the well running business of the countless app providers and the t@@ elecommun@@ ications company .
in the meantime , around the smartphone has grown a whole industry .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Phones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , everything is easy to use via touch screen .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , even today , the company &apos;s most important product is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola , Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
these days now have Apple and Asian providers as Samsung .
the smartphone is an under@@ stand@@ by for 20 years after his invention .
on average , every German car at the age of 88 looks to his mobile phone for 88 times .
&quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone even again , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , in the Siemens executive board for personnel .
permanent acc@@ essibility is now considered as a curse and blessing .
England urged to ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only be in local authorities and throughout London , but in the whole country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the largest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , as well as in 2012 in London when we run a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from playing .
the Olympics presented great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve new possibilities by adding new opportunities for local companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
we alone make 10.000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs , create an end to 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such a thing that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ using on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question every question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn to achieve healthy growth and a legacy of capabilities and jobs to be left as well as in all the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third mil@@ eage , which is supported by £ 16 billion at private investment .
London &apos;s London Olympics were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also one .
it is time that we bro@@ aden this Olympic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skill and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Mouse Play &quot; regarding ad blocking
according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass advertising blocking , an &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; are similar to companies that make money on an online software .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook said that it would block display inser@@ ts on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus issued a blo@@ g@@ post in which users could update their filters in the program to block advertisement in the social network again .
on Tuesday , Facebook decided that its desktop page would change the coding regarding his advertising display to make it display inser@@ ting the determination of the page advertisement , which is part of the page .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight between the in@@ line lock@@ ers open source community and the conver@@ ters have already been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers in the way , &quot; and that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s biggest company for social media has left in the struggle is strong Indi@@ vi@@ z for it , as wor@@ r@@ ying indicators for the industry has become .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people are using the display of the display ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
at 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , manual advertising has 84 percent of the advertising revenue .
the company has got it on ad blocked for desktop PCs , since mobile ad blocked no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agram , shared a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PC makes a sufficient amount of revenue so that Facebook seems to make such a st@@ epp@@ ing as re@@ warding .
on Tuesday , Facebook divided the &quot; ad award &quot; tool &quot; to update the people more control over they focused on advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would have wor@@ r@@ ying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad blocked Are a bl@@ unt remedy , which is why we concentrate on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with susp@@ ecting suicide on the highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police invo@@ ke witnesses after a woman took refuge in the early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ ect suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman came in the dark in an act of desp@@ air &quot; in the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss average age of 49 years , which of several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , was survived to kill yourself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police , who , as well as any witnesses , were promp@@ ted to report .
a preliminary proceedings were opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a conflict avoid@@ able ?
that is something the pro@@ secutor had to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers will not be held to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - with which one person ran out in the dark on the free@@ way - was decided that the drivers must not assume that a pede@@ stri@@ ans run right at night on the free@@ way as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a co@@ p of the neg@@ ligent killing was acquitted when she had killed a man and killed one night at the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim drunk himself and became un@@ conscious of the street .
the court noted that the polic@@ e@@ woman had responded to a call -- on a justified manner -- on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Jud@@ ge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges has to report in the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ o@@ dell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate change , Venus probably was hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus by tools and algorithms that re@@ semble from cli@@ matic researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have identified with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ based ambi@@ ance once .
scientists have previously thought that the slow movement of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , yet @-@ like atmosphere and slowly dis@@ continued .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet is believed to have more dry areas as well as earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic variety to accommodate life and protective for rapid degra@@ dation .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow re @-@ turning of the sun becomes almost two months long , &quot; explained by G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer clouds , which acts as an umbrella to prevent the surface from a large part of the paras@@ ols .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees of cooler than the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought by planet research .
although it was probably hab@@ itable for once , the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ate and her water vap@@ or was burned off by ultra@@ violet light .
when you deposited Hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind - the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a train@@ ee and vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a right participation of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Head of Management and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che &apos;s Energy , Passion and As@@ surance . &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy answered in a statement .
I &apos;ve been thinking about the summer long and have thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs and to bring it onto a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a participation right in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick informed me this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the very best for the future .
at its debut season 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy has received the winners of the Jack Adams Awards as the Best Trainer of the League .
he led the club on 112 points and at first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnes@@ ota and missed during each of the last years .
the description of the season 2015 @-@ 16 marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp and dropped behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two tracks with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ labor@@ ers res@@ ume talks , put on strike
labour strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for the North Sea workers will be exposed to set all the parties for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil @-@ field service providers Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ mark the handling process of the current path , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop several full day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , would be a protest against possible wage ab@@ brevi@@ ations of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market print .
the company &apos;s rating reduction follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore companies in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company have the required space to break through the market down@@ turn .
for its part of thousands of people , Shell has announced plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its range of activities with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are based on lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that was intensi@@ fied by the British ruling by the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish Member of Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders in the start of this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflict which took place in the North Sea since a generation in North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea will be expected to average some $ 7 billion over the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ base of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the newest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope has helped to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars revol@@ ve in star@@ ry as well as in which context of rotation periods with the creation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which were originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now going on the fastest .
leading rot@@ ational rates , this random stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches .
since this winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
if a star is aged , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of an recognis@@ able star spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the newest catalog of rotor blades suggests that more advanced stars revol@@ ve more than just under massive stars .
Reb@@ ull balances the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes and smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be mas@@ sively , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be , very light stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star@@ base of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the same qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us what we want to learn more like how , when and why stars leave their rot@@ ational rates down and so to speak their &quot; dancing gloves . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will appear soon in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star k@@ icks off
with Alex Rodri@@ guez , the tears appeared faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days of base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will take the last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to teach , the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participants in the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature at a tenth year contract signed 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the conflict on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as consultant and youth coach - in full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez numbered long time with their performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Military ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es a couple of milest@@ ones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays only have similar bas@@ eball players in the main statistics related values .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely not to be included in the resting place of the bas@@ eball field .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was that counter@@ latter is its appearance outside of the place .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was launched with &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have forbidden ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , due to a reference in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal in the end of 2014 , he was locked for 211 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be a major susp@@ ect for years to have an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida to achieve efficient funding .
after a law@@ suit the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done for me for the year 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said back then .
his dep@@ ortation days are not less silent .
while many bas@@ eball le@@ gends in their last games still receive the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job contains the attempt to win every game , &quot; Haw@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az and actress Kate Di@@ az , sympathy with the actress Kate Di@@ az , sympathy and sympath@@ ies of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ van@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ sky are first d@@ oping attacks
knowing : wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian destination force from Poland not to start with a positive d@@ op@@ per sample .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ters .
a damaged Ath@@ let@@ in would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh day of the race , the first official d@@ oping attacks have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obst@@ acle from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil - just before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics tests , these messages come to in@@ time .
the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proven on Sunday last Sunday that is used as a mas@@ cot for d@@ op@@ amine substances .
the International Sports Council on Friday afternoon confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly ; just by 0.@@ 09 seconds the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the pre@@ ten@@ sions over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has asked the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation with exam@@ inations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; we shall work together with the International Sports Council ( CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS gover@@ ning the athl@@ ete with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio sick@@ ly the news about the positive sample of Dan@@ ek@@ ova through which 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on his own offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
it is innocent , &quot; the only declaration could be dietary supplement , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics in .
according to the report , it is intended to act with the forbidden substance on the EP@@ O issue .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended pro@@ vision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should be already positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v reported immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ let@@ in to say .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We will be ignor@@ ant under observation , as many have been excluded . &quot;
this may occur around all weight the@@ aters in the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded nation in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the An@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
they both dispute the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another harder blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the complete Russian crew up to an exception because of systematic dev@@ ils , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ ns Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the earlier verses in China had also taken care of athletes between athletes .
so Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ i purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also became the focal point of a confron@@ tation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping fraud , &quot; said this .
sun was positively tested in 2014 with the Chinese championships , but had to sit on the stimul@@ ant of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : as per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ack@@ ers chi@@ pper their rans@@ om
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware att@@ acking out specific companies at present - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of malware @-@ and @-@ specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies were at least once , partly several times of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 per cent of the victims paid will@@ ingly to accept the imp@@ ur@@ ities required by the offen@@ ders to use the challenged systems and data .
the crimin@@ als speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes deliber@@ ately to attacks in corporate networks .
if they succeed , the potential to obtain resolution are significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying quick evolution of the malware software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were designed to send advertising .
then the offen@@ ders re@@ discovered software for themselves .
only , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks had been sc@@ ary quickly during the last months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim active , they search targeted to un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
afterwards , the software introduces the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the repository code to the files , the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ tos@@ ses Bit@@ coin .
but where private users can manage the personal photo database on the game , companies develop sensitive customer data or project databases , without standing the production .
accordingly , the damage falls if a ran@@ som@@ ware beat .
22 per cent of all German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to be completely under@@ cut , in such a case people were in risk of life .
in Germany , several hospitals were already victims of attacks to risk patients affected by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; we say the victims always : pay not , you only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies have to pay their data back .
it is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in view of a stand@@ still .
h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a current study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure investig@@ ates the user surface and the contact with black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to set up a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their sacrifices by chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites , or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t for free example files .
and if private individuals dis@@ solves to payments of only a few hundred Euro , companies have to negoti@@ ate hard and get five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share their work , explains safety expert Che@@ ster Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski of the Antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write about a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
it is more likely , however , that it is three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their harmful software in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits was created by malware themselves , coun@@ sel@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a tool , allowing smaller configuration , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log into one of the forums , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks for another order to install the software on as many PCs .
the payment is performed per infected computer .
&quot; normally , the crimin@@ als register sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ w@@ ski .
today , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that make their data better .
over 50 percent of the companies IT department in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can be used with file @-@ back ups and scanner software .
consequently the offen@@ ders re@@ trace already new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not constitute adequate threat to successful savings , the perpet@@ rators , instead with the release of sensitive data such as account of customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means the potential of damage , depending on the type of data , many times higher than before .
also , the perpet@@ rators will soon take new goals on the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Fin@@ con demonstrated safety researcher , as they could get connected with the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of a der@@ art blocked heating could well be worth a rans@@ om .
if the crimin@@ als instead of the heating in the future could block a whole production street in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
in the small HR @-@ V Honda still wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers carried a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the indoor habitat &apos;s materials are well processed and comfortable , only the cockpit @-@ top falls slightly .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l and 10@@ 26 l of the back arm@@ rests , but it gives the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
that &apos;s less magical as it sounds : the seat areas of the rear can be folded like chin bo@@ ilers and thus provide storage space that is up to a height of 1,@@ 24 m from the ground up to ceiling .
the boot space can be loaded well , but the load @-@ height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in a wide speed range .
his work should be somewhat qui@@ eter , however .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering system should be a bit more direct .
the equipment is open to the tested Top @-@ variant &quot; Executive , &quot; doesn &apos;t have any wishes .
the city @-@ emergency braking system is one of the safety systems ( works up@@ to 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the track @-@ assist@@ ent .
the coll@@ ision alert sometimes conf@@ uses , because he controls many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ding objects . &quot;
a very reliable work of remote assistance .
and the smart temperature regulator works on the road recognition and thr@@ ottle the speed when necessary .
the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI connector lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest in such a way will receive the fuel from 20,000 Euro , the diesel of 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not responsible : fall on air bridge
an air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the air@@ lift .

the accident could have carried everywhere , however , it is a common risk of life , such as the court .
the airline doesn &apos;t have to pay any damage to the man .
illness cases : when paid the organizer
getting sick vac@@ ation@@ ers get money back after their trip , if the cause of the illness can be doub@@ tful in the hotel .
but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the score ad@@ mit@@ tedly show the same symptoms .
in the settled case a family was heavily ill on diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting in a row on the second day .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
her illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back on a defective treatment plant which allegedly poll@@ uted sea water .
the family was the view that had been a lack of help - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
before the court , the claim@@ ers had no success .
indeed the her@@ b@@ lower is indeed defective .
but the organiz@@ ers already learned about the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff before departure .
until then , he had to assume that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
he didn &apos;t hurt his information , thus the judgment .
especially in the samples of water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps sometimes by cont@@ ag@@ ion - belonged to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were sick .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violence crimes committed in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were anxi@@ ous against further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided to react to terror@@ ists at the same time .
sure is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and the split .
we will not treat this triumph to terror@@ ists .
if perpet@@ rators should travel faster , this would increase the safety and strength of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the Bun@@ dest@@ in@@ s@@ election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sympath@@ e@@ ity for terrorism must be again charged .
video surveillance is designed to increase the weapons right so much that the purchase of weapons will be fixed in the internet .
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of doctors should stay in words named after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , in dialogue with the doctor &apos;s approach , he wants to look for solutions that could be dimin@@ ished , he said with views of mental ab@@ normal@@ ities .
to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister still maintains a better social support .
teachers would need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the un@@ covered investigations .
the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly spoke of action against shareholder .
&quot; this was a scar@@ let for the sni@@ ff@@ akers in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition and the abol@@ ition of the dual nationality .
a general prohibition of fully digest@@ ion contents is un@@ law@@ less problem@@ atic .
one cannot offer anything that is con@@ jec@@ ting , and I reject wearing the Bur@@ ka .
could you talk about rules regarding traffic or witness against judgment .
green boss Simone Peter has designed the minister because he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror pack@@ ets and power capability .
left @-@ Party executive manager Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; Fle@@ et Fle@@ et and a deep@@ ening of the stay on the right does not bring people in this country any more security . &quot;
better traffic flow at the highway toll road
it is checked regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but that should change : the right turns shall be extended .
that is good news for all the car drivers who are standing in traffic on the surrounding street every evening in St@@ au , if they are going through the motorway ( A 43 ) .
road construction extends along the upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 . August ) in the area between Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ er Straße lies the right @-@ fle@@ dged road by 700 metres .
drivers can then drive straight from the Hammer road on the right .
the main advantage : transportation will have an early delivery which will enhance the overall process on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
the road for driving on the br@@ is is the driving distance above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the return ticket extends to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h way and sometimes also beyond the bridge .
reason is the pin@@ point on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic will only be sent to the motorway bridge .
the second trace had to be built over a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations suggest that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to record the heavy @-@ duty traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and that related value may continue , the competent local company cannot say .
however , it is worth reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official rest of life up to 20@@ 34 .
for extending the right turns , the state of the country has deliber@@ ately chosen the traffic weaker times during the school holidays , because the disability is to be counted .
the traffic will pass on Tuesday and on Wednesday without a trace of the construction site .
Inter@@ cultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are planning a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people to visit and refugee education , cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Münster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students between eleven and 15 years attended the st@@ aging in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association organis@@ es the cultural integration of adolescents with an immig@@ rant and refugee camp towards the goal of visiting schools with welcome opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the yo@@ ung@@ sters of the class will be made between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and do little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , scenic pictures and video animations , it is possible to follow the course of action , so the release of the boy The@@ aters Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ chen@@ berg and the Young Theatre are working together during the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project .
between October and December , adolescents with and without escape and migration background are to be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , drama and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theater play and theat@@ rical language placement are in planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased refugees , the association expects a number of classes to participate in .
rain instead of stars : hope for weather repair
the weather has made the star sni@@ ff Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest Germany in the night to Friday a stamp on the bill - but there is still hope .
the night would have been po@@ or@@ ly suitable for clouds and rain to watch the He@@ av@@ ant@@ el , the chairman of the Astr@@ onom@@ ous Ob@@ servatory , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many star@@ ters in the sky .
with the stell@@ ations , these are Persian , which belong to the fastest constellation with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is on the north east .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , one gets around forever , in the morning it is enough for hours , but in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep anymore .
that is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent feel their sleep very often or permanently .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes may be based on them , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
whatever you understand , the in@@ som@@ nia is , thus an in@@ feed and sleeping trouble .
especially those who sleep through , many people feel un@@ satisfactory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Haus@@ er association with practice in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep changes are complex .
behind this , organic , mental or behavi@@ oral @-@ related factors can also be used .
not rare is the sleep distur@@ bing expression of another illness .
&quot; very early wake @-@ up is common especially for depression often , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it may be that different factors need each other .
whoever has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc could lie badly , every two to three hours w@@ akes up , and perhaps swal@@ low up , about everyday problems and wor@@ ms , gives up an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep with sleep changes to the doctor ?
who doesn &apos;t sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is imp@@ aired on the day , should go to the doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look very different : it is sh@@ atter@@ ed , tired , im@@ print , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood disorders , or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces it is important to find out their causes .
other treatment options include , among other things , cogn@@ itive Beha@@ vi@@ or or drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany , there are hardly imagin@@ ative sleep in Germany , st@@ resses Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of the inter@@ disciplinary centre of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why you should first turn to sleep at bed@@ time at bed@@ time , betra@@ t We@@ e@@ ß .
may clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens there ?
for exam@@ ining in sleep laboratory , for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory suffer@@ ers , in case of disease defects , or if you cannot find the cause of a diar@@ disorder , Fi@@ etz@@ e explains .
it doesn &apos;t really have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make a nap , &quot; Fi@@ etz@@ e says .
after wired one goes to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one is wearing a nose chest , a chest strap and a cow@@ l on the finger .
in addition , a camera will sleep back on the ceiling .
how can individual problems get involved in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of actu@@ ators where you can sit for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleep and down@@ times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , drinking alcohol and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to pay straight away , and that is absolutely not favorable .

the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has now protected his ex @-@ team@@ mates to the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle of € 15@@ 0,000 was no one about lack of medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page .
the feed system in water sports is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good .
with this we can not compete with countries , that do so much , and make it easy on the topic D@@ oping - or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to run a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported as early as nine months before his first start of the German Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should maintain it with countries .

airport : Bag@@ gage is arrested by Bag@@ gage
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the polic@@ emen of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer were able to capture two women and two men aged from 50 to 61 years .
the crime suspic@@ ious were committed as ban@@ de several bags and luggage di@@ ps .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognised a gang from the airport of Düsseldorf , which was known by the polic@@ emen from previous theft .
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ic@@ ien@@ te since mid @-@ July this year and worked very professionally .
the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ariats 34 can disp@@ ose of the th@@ ie@@ ves , which were entered for off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences , four actions .
they took a total of over 15,000 Euro .
old buildings , some lime@@ stone blocks , meanwhile a rest of the cob@@ bled stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not affect the first glance , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the street from the east to the west , one gets lost on playing places , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a gray house . &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which will also be pulled down soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built until 2017 .
articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; how the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , is clearly illustrated in the last few weeks with burning cars .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was busy , now the residents are occupied , but there are rooms in the ground floor and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inside of the building bears several times for stub@@ born police against the project , the area known as &quot; No @-@ Go Zone , &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , were repor@@ tedly pat@@ ended with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked off parts of the road and maintained visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown owners , the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later police and building workers came under the it@@ ch of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
this summer afternoon , the street is peaceful : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late Sa@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who grew up here three children , are particularly generic above all about the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they occupy the care of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished to produce repeated police @-@ coat in front of a andal@@ ous Left .
the tom@@ at , which of the Berlin wall and the c@@ ops were somewhere between squ@@ ander@@ ing and their neigh@@ bors , obviously not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average and high risk of poverty .
many buildings and the native residential projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire ma@@ z street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police officers in a down@@ right street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and still inhabited by people today , which they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly popular for tourists and pol@@ lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them native people from the GDR and former house owned their Kiev .
this is also reflected in the rent , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize it on collected discs , or freshly painted faces , which were subjected to gra@@ dients .
no other road was mentioned so often along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for this , that not all neigh@@ bors who should see this as a problem might be that they are not imp@@ acted by crime : off@@ ences like body injury , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make objec@@ tions from those who tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there cannot be any talk of un@@ certainty .
as for violence , it is an important thing : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who would not have been .
even the famous burning cars can give it directly in the ri@@ gs no longer .
for studying archit@@ ec@@ in , her road is not a crime focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one can fight each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
re@@ born is consci@@ ously moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and stayed .
this is why it was so important that local residents got back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the de@@ war@@ eness of the district in July .
but in the eyes of re@@ inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to leave them : by ges@@ less new built in former buildings that displ@@ ace ancient inhabitants .
&quot; these are ultimately furnished apartments which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not as well cared for , &quot; she says .
&quot; I can absolutely not gu@@ ist violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should we do if someone else is listening to ?
sitting on all sides of fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has spar@@ ed little understanding for Zu@@ zo@@ gen@@ gene , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines .
whoever draws , should be aware of his - just like someone who moves into a k@@ nei@@ pp district to compl@@ ain about noise there .
all persons presented with pre@@ names have asked to be called not with their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for the integration and organizer .
also , she is social worker in situ .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the Social Ped@@ agog@@ ical team is supporting the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee aid , administration , authorities , and those else .
Reg@@ ine customer , of working group , indicates that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now who has a problem of wool being experienced , which primarily has a problem .
thus some - less mo@@ ck@@ ling than on the multitude of those wishing to target areas - meant as the management wanted to write the place .
we were looking for an administration expert with a talent for languages and people connected with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a giant Woll@@ man .
but administrative work is not its primary area , An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le thinks .
above all , it is about organization , working with people on site and behind the scenes as well as net material .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has spent a 50 percent point on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; Reg@@ ine client says that An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le supports honorary and alleged actors .
there are large and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are in the water@@ way .
a significant problem has been found since some time , apartments for connecting flights , has been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for connection assembly .
they need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired homes .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility is alternat@@ ing with the advis@@ ory board on the Commun@@ e and the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time being very difficult .
management is de facto the management of any private apartments .
so far , it has not been working on private apartments , so d@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore common apartments have to be considered as it is so beautiful .
so new containers will soon be placed in the basin road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , are reg@@ ine customer and an@@ ni@@ ka d@@ eu@@ sch@@ le included .
besides a solid lead , practic@@ ing places , training places , school @-@ places , one @-@ euro jobs and foreign activities for migrants and migrants , must be und@@ und@@ ated or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do not profit work - and that &apos;s motivation and very tidy , as An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reported .
she hopes the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but he does not mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people should develop a feeling of jurisdiction .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with native people , and mainly language courses .
professional courses are rare .
thus , managing and honor of honor jump .
it was central that the refugees obtain the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you have to explain the refugees that it just takes and allows them to bridge the time , for example with language courses .
whoever wants to develop the feeling he could not be unable to work in Ur@@ bach , he might not work and be un@@ profitable which will never be integrated .
the clear majority is highly motivated .
there is no problem cases , but customer is honest , &quot; people who are doing nothing at all . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer may always motiv@@ ate others to motiv@@ ate others .
this is all a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two are afraid of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach , too ?
&quot; no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the hel@@ pers are already suspic@@ ious .
these inci@@ dents were also subject to the refugees .
they would be afraid that the attacks bring them complete into dis@@ rep@@ ute .
&quot; they want us to show that they have nothing to do with them , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so we must look for basic and honor on the site and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new store on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
to answer this question clearly , the politics are afraid .
actually , it is un@@ fair to put them on the spot .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go there , &quot; An@@ ni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also appreci@@ ates that the Ur@@ b@@ acher had already been utilized so that earlier people are r@@ ational to r@@ ational .
they are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in distress , they must help them , both women agree .
the political situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
