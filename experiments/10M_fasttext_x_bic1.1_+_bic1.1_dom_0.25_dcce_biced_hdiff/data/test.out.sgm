<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the pyramids of sports</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf course in South Africa, Bernhard Langer studied a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58 year old it was a first.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After some minutes the horses reminded their holiday, they were hunting in their fast Gallop home to feed the feeding.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometre at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left himself with his family about the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even slick to photo frames.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen, making the CHIO for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport watch handed over to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala dinner.</seg>
<seg id="15">Honours the sympathetic patrons are not.</seg>
<seg id="16">Grand Cross Order, Silver with laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has killed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the pyramid of sports is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first laureates Hans Günter Winkler.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means to me a lot," says Langer, "for she is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer promotes the young talents.</seg>
<seg id="22">And thus he received the prize money of 25.000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" in Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The excellent members of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, who was born by Feeder Cornelia Hanau, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the founder of the founder Peter-Michael Kolbe, the beloved Alwin Shockemöhle and posthumously of the handfuller Erhard Wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the unusual society immigrated to the Springfield, where the Lavazza price ran.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trump Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">To invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are in charge of tax and energy policy as well as in principle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is one of the basic and philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the State.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the doubt small in doubt and warns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and controls.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">But by contrast, it would be quite different.</seg>
<seg id="9">There will be massive shutdown and it turns out for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton indeed says: the state has certain tasks to open, he has adisadvantaged chances and needs money for that.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To invest in the muts, Trump and Clinton say almost literally.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-ritual Teachy wings of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus even partial internal discussions could be added on trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and plant the coal for coal in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction must also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate agreement intends to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpaziless trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both companies not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but simply only American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, e.g. Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe him, that the budget deficit would make it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton stands that at least demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are alone to escape, almost to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a wide kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put its little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks great with big eyes in the room.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Katrin Bahr is talking to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the division managing director of Condrobs, a support for social support in Bavaria, and amongst others on the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralised accommodation for single women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich's help of Women.</seg>
<seg id="18">They have been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically prosecuted, because of them torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope."</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, other reasons behind the escape: "many are secretly entangled because they don't see another outgoing."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourishing, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the tugboat for example call for a bottle of water a sexual action is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany, Bahr is telling.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps are often considered as inferior and misused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to some 90 percent of women who live in the North of Munich, traumatized at the apartment.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't need to help, there are more accommodations for them, for Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they continue from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction, some answers with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben, alone women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press Officer of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Sub- and Mittelfranken there are available floors or their own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central hotels for women only.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on women and Gender Equality adopted by the European Parliament also calls for women to be detached from men.</seg>

<seg id="46">And especially the washrooms should be separated and accessible to women, it is included in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">As much as the women feel this need, one can discern the crowds starting at the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"having been around since it has been around us, we have a long queues," says Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the Assistenzinarians have called upon their union to approve new workers measures in their dispute concerning a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) demanded its entire advice, approving more working measures starting in early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that there was Minister for ministers, to respond to the worries about the contract.</seg>

<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the President of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was "harrly quiet" which led to problems that the treaty was rejected.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of External lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's leaders of Russia and Turkey came on Tuesday to announce their hands and to proclaim the official end of the eight months of the words of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterpart in the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg Palace in the reception, I can not forbid them that Ankara wanted to do these reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no fight, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin smiles were very dirty and he spared little warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, talked about his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve it.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have gone so behaved something bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable audacity showed that Russia's State had not forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to mention in his quotes: the shooting of a Russian campaign against Turkey on the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Moscow in response to the time of Moscow was wronged.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told him and accused Ankara to admit Russia into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The result was even greater, as it was committed by a false friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The showcase will be rebuild, if not impossible, even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would carry for everything the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials have benefited from the illegal oil trade in the fields of Syria, which would be controlled by the so-called Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed that vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apologizing, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">To Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily required all the friends he can get, after he had a failed coup d "état of almost his eye.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey were shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban of batches, which usually generate several million Russian tourists every year to Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count towards a late-season onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, state television funded fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this: "tourists there are long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, as it was a reaction to trying power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continued Groll talks on the EU acceding negotiations and Putin - that is out of the cool mood to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of state won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara, having called for the attempted coup d "état against the selected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-evident for Moscow to have a self-understanding, which even has a profound fear of opponents.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace was enabled in Russia and Turkey, a way it was an analyst once describing me an analyst, "alliance of outsideways." two countries that violate the West and feel poorly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still vast differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow dropped the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey will support mutual pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noting that after almost three hours of first discussion, both presidents say on the press conference, that they would not even have striped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">Turkey was deliberately avoided the President of Turkey to answer their differences when Putin decided to emphasise it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disasters, as NATO member Turkey drafting the Russian margjet - it certainly is better that the two leaders say at least one another.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan has divided the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand had been connected to the global ambitions of the Bank.</seg>

<seg id="6">In this time, "RBS" brand strategist uses to protect other end-consumer brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">It supported international sport with millions of pounds to Sponsorship, from the Six Day Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to move more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales every RSB references, the headquarters and stock exchange quotation are changed to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other but smaller brands for private clients, which will get more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN was interviewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He divided the BBC Scotland with us: "the RSB brand becomes one of our investors' brand and to the brand that our staff is employed, since we will now become a bank of stamps."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the Bank has become a global brand itself, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but are pursuing local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own parishes for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will no longer be continued by its six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in his sport sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop toward the Bank of brands, for how do we concentrate on it (we asked) to make this a better bench for clients?" he said the Board of Management.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, when we said we had a great bank for our customers and we have launched this brand.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can be launched back these brands, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="8">Born 1972 in Tallinn, capital of Tallinn, he graduated in International Relations Department of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website, it is (in Russian) that he later was later vice president and head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin on his appointment, "thank you for trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to assist your activity as a state of state security and inspections in implementing your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted confidanins and works as he worked for the Soviet Intelligence Service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed to withdraw at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridiment for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once was referred to as a potential President once more would lead to Russian environmental policies - faced a great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said "It is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say this very complicated post - they could almost say - to incite them for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential management for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV recorded the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Parliament Intelligence Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to become his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin was propitious to power, he called Ivanov as one of five of whom he trusted in.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov was accepted into Putin's second term President of Russia, as a third term in Putin would have concealed the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another ally in Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became the President for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queenstill Crossen with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four appointments of the "stud dog" which will approach the bridge around each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The roaring section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 scrap ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Minister of Economy Keith Brown finished the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "It is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queenstill Crossen.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering process of a truly epic measure of this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the completion between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of 79% of the total bridge links in their place and the last section of the decks gets a betting kiss to the deck today, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a considerable milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of trendsetting high-quality and deep-construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last road cut and its connection with the Nordturmdeck structure we had to close the still existing gap on the northern or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder jetty 700 millimeter to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate function.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, approx. 6.000 tons weighs and with an ascent of approximately 3% had to be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="19">Getting, given the tolerances running on the team, they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds German leasing apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Green Party: investors are becoming a lot more likely to be taken into duty.</seg>
<seg id="3">How will we respond to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 wooden homes in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept" in the next grid.</seg>
<seg id="5">However conflict is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, it is all about the question: who should build the favorable flats?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">The SPD Vice-President Christoph Bratmann means: "we are happy with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, will in future be 20 percent of all flats than social deliveries."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the favorable flats can also arise in the stocks.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the great traffic in the town hall was, however, as Bratmann: "how are you going to grow with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development program, which costs millions of dollars and has to be financed, is scheduled to provide for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, as Bratmann: "there is currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few times as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants a hardness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, if Bratmann, the flag is an increase of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The action concept will be implemented, will provide additional duties in the administration building.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear if we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not completely completely: the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how can you compare the loss of about 1300 favorable flats, whose promotion will run in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, such as planning for Nicole Palm, planned bindings should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the pricing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one fell swoop to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city the end of the year are underway.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get there in pricing for affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this is the owner, the housing companies do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the number of social allowances in the western city is drastically increased, you remove from the target of the so-called circulating mixture.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social shaking in just a few parts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Group's leader Holger Heratterschke means: "for a wide majority the CDU must take into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I have focused on more building sites for family homes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenage boys and child to play no longer go outside but rather they prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens, was suing over the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The screen on the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and finally on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities are not open each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a animation series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand appeared in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that overlapped the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players arrive outside with their smartphones to search out and search for Pokémons, which are followed with a GPS and once they have found, "photograph" (above a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "taken". "</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps which recalls the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio, an app for Apple Watch, followed the 35,000 users, divided the Washington Post earlier, that in two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 30 percent, who jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays with Pokémon Go - it just provides raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public reconnaissance campaigns are going to take care of "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport may not be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drive sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that people bring people to do something in the open, which makes them enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="22">In this way, three pillars of health are covered - Movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friends on hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also merious play destroys, which must always complain about.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit activity traced back earlier, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use is delayed by time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help so many people on hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fight victory and consolidates the fifth one, while it consolidates the best of its generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears, when her end was shown and her long journey was found in that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success makes them in the same League such as Michael Phelps, who gave their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles dominates the last three years, including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 'Mary Lou bailon told her that she was "the best gymnast, which I ever saw."</seg>
<seg id="17">They expected the last examination in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of athletes, rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="24">This girl, which was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainee Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, in which Boorman trained, became the power.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013 she has lost no more fight competition, a winning series which will continue so long as it wishes.</seg>

<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when they fought for the third place, but the bronze head was in a low place Mustafa.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports that were published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed, who were killed in one of the most deadly attacks by Phoenix in one decade, while they listened to the car and heard music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator cheered eight shots from a manual weapon, while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, then read the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police told, that the triad murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, because the attackers refused to carry out the handbags or the $2,900 which belonged to one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Police Academy by Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investigators was directed to become a closer look if it is connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in Hispanic residential objects within four months in nine months and two injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," shared Howard ZHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that suspects has used several cars, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to specify the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed to the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present for me under the Women's Olympics and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I joined the summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three turnerves, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which looked for many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, the Jedin is and Madison Kocian, who is Catholics, is of every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This crew finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has consolidates the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, number one under the female tower was a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year was Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and the Americas cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to prove the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but masterful gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won an individual multi-struggle event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of this sport, but we don't see gyms throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will have only four turnergies in the team. Marta Karolyi is the last year as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks that gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner first in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents, which are inadequate for the training, alignment, travel and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families). the list can be continued at any time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in wealthy countries that can help business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner will maintain their overall training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to inspect the communion with countless, young girls, that are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a skilled and easier-to-reach gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my doctorate in 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">For my events we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teens (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high quality gymnastics to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strength, strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and identification for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits to health, as well as for professional and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls to interest for the gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real picture of "Girl Power" through the Holen of the Olympic team and thanks, you take so many young girls with different background to begin their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the argument over the changes by adopting a reformist Treaty by the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 associates who vote in a vote.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt's plans revealed to lead the contract by forcibly and said that the NHS would be in a "Niemandsland" if any further delay would be harmful for the employees and patients.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the president of the BMA Commiter of Assistenzinarians stayed last night in a communication with: "Assistenzinarians have reached the proposed treaty in particular that it will take care of the present calendar crisis and to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With just eight weeks, which still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA contribute to the solution of the dispute through talks on the government's sake and sometimes deafening silence on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was done by saying that Jeremy Hunt just made the last month that his door would always open.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £2-per day drug due to the authorities recommended by the authorities for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The drug drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeating heart attacks for people with a heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">This medication is given a heart attack for 12 months, causing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NHS regulation of the NHS has a four year ingestion recommended to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer from a heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collecting fatty material in the arteries that resemble floorings.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the topping breaks up, it can cause a blood clots that clogged the flow of blood to the heart and caused a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the blood clots dissolves, it may flow through blood stream and clogged the flow of blood to the brain, which causes a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, is marketed under the merchant name Brilique, reducing this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The design draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 month ingestion of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Service Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with despatrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor is in combination with aspirin effectively in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who had already a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand the available options to thousands of people who benefit from this.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years. the introductory bill does not advise the treatment that goes beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a bit safer.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, in order to find out how to get up with armed robbers at the distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn your robber on the skewer.</seg>
<seg id="5">When one approached them from behind, then you should turn off when you can see your attackers and "turn out" out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon then between your forearm and your shoulder to face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike it with the knee to the body and turn it down, while the attacker might turn down because of pain. hit him by running your face and move backwards while they perform the weapon upon him.</seg>
<seg id="8">At attackers, which approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, take the weapon and turn it, so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, store the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then you turn the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and judge the weapon.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="1">Travel Ian Wright goes off for a travel guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and thrieflex of serious examination by resting some of the most polluted places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright (51, from Suffolk slipped off his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a jetty of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before moving any object he used a Luminometer to show itself and to show us what he is embarked on.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner STRENGTH," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to stop the flush button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, but may actually be disgusting, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright with doctors and medical professionals talked about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left in his mouth more than a bad foretaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world, and had a strange and magnificent stuff.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to jetting crap of toilets, the task put his immune system definately under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">He told it in the film: "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was appointed to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he was rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its provered line showed an uminosometal count of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometal number is freshly-washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to leave, after their Luminometal count amounted to over 4000 units, while freshly-washed hands have a population of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner STRENGTH," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the movie he says: "this comes to the worst thing I have robbed in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will stop here nothing because it's inside there inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner STRENGTH" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips master Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstorings through which we ended, that we told, "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in rectal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking only about the products we wanted to ask them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information in the consumer about an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me have lost my respect for Ian, if he would have tasted some of the things that I had instructed him to lick it like the legendary Russian toilet, which will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, to lick it and others, with which this was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 per cent, said that they may use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant said goodbye to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and to their family as a delay is always the last step, the Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was a very difficult case, as the behavior extremely was and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community that have courageous to us and have provided information to us.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will deliver comfort to some neighbours, and the message conveys that governing behavior will not be tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-Year the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With it a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstine masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra conducted by Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," warms he.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that they are very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we have really enjoyed amber music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this stage, Bartoli plays a older statue of Mary.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers to her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dancing.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because they are musically outstanding!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then Mari's personality would be a personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it her song: 'I Feel Pretty, oh so Pretty, I Feel Pretty and witty and Bright. "</seg>
<seg id="17">It is therefore clever, of course also naive, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it resembles me very much my Italian character, which I have as a Roman Empire," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a need for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in any of his movements, in his looks, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a southern temper, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" at the moment: "in this piece it's about prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, we moved to New York City and did not want to arrive to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful as that.</seg>

<seg id="2">"who doesn't suit and Erdogan sits on, sits on burgers," says the Presidency of the Gülen-approaching Foundation dialog and World, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community of Germany expects to short notice with tens of thousands of guards, coming from Turkey to Germany.</seg>

<seg id="12">With that Erdogan wants to increase the withdrawal-back to the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been wiped out or distributed over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also the CDU member.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propulsion of the government asked that the Federal Government correctly positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers. "</seg>
<seg id="15">Also in Germany a "witch-hunt" against Erdogan-critics are taking place.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months.</seg>

<seg id="2">Selenames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't pick up anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the dialling Code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Central parliament decided in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and land competition - that's the biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the election players are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vast majority of tourists who are in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not the natives, so they aren't allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">These come practical problems: in the holidays we are helpers, inflating posters, inflating balloons, flyers and end at the end of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and final Feriday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again to let the people pass over to the colony.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, when you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition to fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, like heavy newcomer AFD cuts and what remains at the end of co-workers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 government of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from its large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, roses roses and chatting a little with the people, as it did his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, soul mastering got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel on the narrowness of the AFD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, you "We create that" I accelerates the rise of the right wing populist, which will presumably cost him the beautiful ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU and its nickname data, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced, as it is, when you make a wrong place at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Angela Merkel to grandmother twice, the German parliamentary district is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Westphalia and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this was probably the majority of other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is a pity that nobody can listen to other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Nordost-CDU discovers largely on the usual market places and shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, so, says Kokert, plays only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noticed that you omalke the base on the country that she needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly available in the times of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU campaign, Koko to his Mitstrel, is also self-exposed: "they have to go there where people are: Dorftmost, Golden Weddings, every birthday party needs to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much at stake, Sellering has now called up his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys the social democrats were last with 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just under the AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD still won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in the polls, should be able to jump on the farm day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from the adversity adversity, and lay their election campaign largely on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign" is the leader Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green champions give their search to search for local vocal chicks among tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the nicknamed didatin, bent straight with a houseboat in the mecklands lakes and finds it even nice.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "campaign in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 Refurbishment: finding sites suffer from barriers</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the responsibilities of the construction work, starting at 5.30 o'clock in the morning and only at around 20 o'clock, there are allotating praises.</seg>
<seg id="4">"all they made pretty shackly," Elvira Tetzlaff is telling the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a supermodel.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was transferred to the South at the end of October, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">Likewise, the opposite is responsible for the construction work, e.g. when it comes to furnishings of domination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site on Monday moved to the south and also the locking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen was lifted, and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the place relaxes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens now can drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The carving traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partially substantial complaints," says the deputy chief manager Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">Local residents of Bachel, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weihernia had to fight with more traffic noise, because many shuttles looked for and rather familiar with their Navi as the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were migrated in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limiting have not been maintained, the municipality urged to amplify the measuring vehicle from Mössing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant survivals," says King, who himself pointed to the location on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">They have been billed two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The freeway was at 77 hours of hour in the pace-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site went further, it was quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that is now open to customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27-rehabilitation has led to sovereignty, everyone who asks you to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">But some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who has less to do with the "end customer" so for other firms, it has barely followed for the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz talks of an "maximum slight decline," but also appears that of course the balance bike is missing. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The local along the road are exploited along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, Owner of Steakhouse, First Crown, finds distinct words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only Him, but all the restaurants I met "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro.</seg>
<seg id="32">The revenue decrease was "far above 50 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="33">The street theatre had its operation "back for two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He has dismissed the half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would react differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt acted on a request from Göhner, if it could give up a financial compensation, the restaurant also benefited from the advantages of location on the B. now they also have the disadvantages that yielded by the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all ages, Göhner is sure that his guest house will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has settled since 1715, he refers to the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="40">For other regular traffic vendors now see less frequently, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot get caught, it is also very nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his ancestors fall back after the renovation work, Göhner has no doubts about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 works on his clientele for the biggest crisis, which has experienced its inn in many years of history.</seg>
<seg id="44">The construction of six months is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The IS is constantly bolted in the name of the counter-terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the recent attacks, Secretary of Interior de Maizière puts a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what does a niotic status have to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciled.</seg>
<seg id="6">All of his suggestions are "politically acceptable," says the Federal Minister of Interior under the launch of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are asking anybody.</seg>
<seg id="8">Others, further points would be discussed first within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also, I dibbed myself.</seg>
<seg id="10">But as interior minister, it was close to both results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">Following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière presented a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But now the larger ones fall out.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has already announced, announced, tilt: that a new security department is to take care of remote communication, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on airfreight data and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security agencies also does not come unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière takes a second stop for proposals to do so far with the SPD: he wants to conserve menstruation for terrorists and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," grants the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he kept doing this for reasonable and challenge nothing, which has no chances for the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas were presented by Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are in themselves: he is planning rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for deporting people from the deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted to the country are to let their smartphone in advance and open social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">At Dulce for expired asylum seekers he wants to put some even worse than so far - about such an offences or deliberately discard their identity to wear their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legally holy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some even seem to be imbalanced and open questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some point - with the imbalances of patient, for example - arises the question: what does it have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between topics refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not easy to say that the assassination of Ansbach and Würzburg have been refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, many people struggled about the high number of refugees concerned about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that had to be devoted to people now did not recover in campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety has grown enormously in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First of all the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The unlocking is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are contours.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the issue of internal security, the Union and the SPD can therefore increasingly stand in position.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days there was steep between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garstical argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions Minister, in which the departments also call for a Burka ban and a return of dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière thrives around conciliatory sound.</seg>
<seg id="39">He is nothing from a return from a double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have enjoyed the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">They are emerging, do not make sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in a Burka-prohibition, he had constitutional objections.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is unconstitutional at all the corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, only has to show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of things which could cause conflict.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is trying to profiling an inner safety on the topic of inner safety.</seg>

<seg id="8">Worldwide, the VW brand was sold in July with 449100 cars and 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sales in Western Europe alone, China's second most important market, sales up 14 percent below last year's level.</seg>

<seg id="17">Head of Corporate Finance Fred Kappler was able to report a sales pole from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time, worldwide 5,904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen has control gas tests with a software.</seg>

<seg id="2">Banquet Josef Paul said on Thursday, "it's only about 139 customers who have 40 million euros on the sight deposit or the daily paedible."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Association of German banks speaks of one individual and does not see any signal: normal savings would not be afraid, to pay for their austerity policy. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Banks lend money over night to the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay a 0.4 per cent penalty.</seg>
<seg id="5">This charge applies to Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September by privat- and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight or discount price.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the first 100,000 euros is free."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the next 100,000 will continue to cost 400 Euro per year," Paul said.</seg>
<seg id="8">For some time he kept EUR 40 million, which could be withdrawn from one day to the others and which he could not utilize.</seg>
<seg id="9">"they are at my bank account and make a 0.4 percent cost," said the chef.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I can't go down for a million 400,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="11">He now continues the costs for the decay principle.</seg>
<seg id="12">To leave the cash in the vaults of Raiffeisenbank, it would be much too dangerous: "I have already experienced four cases, I do not like the fifth!," said the Chief Financial Officer.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would have no understanding and change on other investments.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a few emigrated to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooperative association Bavaria declared: "the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing substantial costs in all banks."</seg>
<seg id="16">It alone is not possible to carry, either "effectively permanently". "</seg>
<seg id="17">Some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Thüringer Volks- and Raiffeisenbank Altenburg in 2014 had made headlines with pendicular surgery for deposits from three million euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "we don't expect to pay Individuals nationwide emptying for deposits, the competition in Germany is too strong for banks and savings banks."</seg>
<seg id="20">A banker said, at the Tegernsee, there is "a clientel, which is much lush from the property."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this can be a little bank for a small bank," if it is free money for free.</seg>
<seg id="22">Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Erefuse, Kreuth and Tegernsee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Living actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are no other banks known to the federation association Bavaria, "announcing a budget set for deposits of private customers," said spokesperson Ernst.</seg>

<seg id="1">Distination records: who really ys noise records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to revise him under the pseudonym-n-rate male's age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the extensive resurgence of sound boards not to a boom in Millennials who want to greet the curiosity of physical objects, but attributed to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are of all likelihood according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbysitter - it has an emotional meaning: older churchers rather retain their feelings for himself (56% vs 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, I would like to follow the camera in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and a wild feeling like this: "so, let us cast a closer look at it." so, let us take a closer look. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although the heart of Sohos is running slowly to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filled the buildings where the independent sales are located - there are still a handful of fantastic record specifications.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera man to shift the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stud from Glasgow, 55, whom I of sister Ray (s number: two young women, three men middle age) to Reckless Records (number of men: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound boards, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I followed him not home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy them, when he was sold, when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70s, who was released when I was 11 or 12. things to whom I was probably something too young to buy them" says he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees to those who are buying records, rather introverted and like to spend time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at sister Ray, believes that many customers who hits you to get on Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who have heard over their comeback and have caused to buy their old plates again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks that I have led, people usually decided to pay attention to their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now, sell their CDs to buy them again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of the attachent of a record rebuilding of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record business offers a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the previous clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some songs fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of trusted record cover, of objects, and happy itants.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or property of any kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" shoots out an employee of a record deck.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people purchased a record last month they have not listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found that 41% have a record player, which they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the report it would probably look very much worried as I petalled by a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data count: three men middle age) has noticed a "trophies aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put them inside the shelf. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicians.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound board almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I'm going to be clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teens and women of middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beasts latest Synthesizers and sexed pop instead of Experimental Jazz drynt from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such a diversity in the clients.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but nail-psychic traumata are hard to imagine if you are standing next to someone over 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for several minutes and sees the variety of the plates flying.</seg>
<seg id="49">It more makes a display bumper as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore, the gathering of plates is not real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of lounges: urban outfit.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I note the appearance of jeans bite, I watch a group of young teen cities, which are devoted to a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left you find a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to handle it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in considering that any attraction for these objects signify more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, including that which is most for luxury objects like sheets.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collector and record holder that exist in reality, record shops and Onlineforen, untaken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumbleed by the Berwick Street and the leaves with plates, while she meight dredess an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, that didn't rise above the shoulders of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live, settled down.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of a court hearings this week, the authorities argue that the state should sell, sell 72 temporary stores in those persons, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture also argued that these places should be lower, because they would be paid to a parallel economy, which would not be paid for tax and risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals that are offered by the government supported association and other groups, do not offer sufficient food for growing numbers in stock.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also carried out that the temporary shops and restaurants will often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the dismissal of people who operate the 72 temporary shops, but that the concerns of the Calais "prefecture are absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role to feed the "live" in extremly preceditary conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet hits between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that were threatened by the low-repent was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which was shared efficiently and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice to asylum seekers for the hundreds of needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids' café true.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it meant that the closure is for those children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest are eight years old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">The two Help organizations help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants were estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle live have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number now - after a steep increase of new arrivals in the course of the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain's 7-inch rugby came to a final stop at the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, descending, line and rocks to win gold - their first Olympics of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was dispatched by the not too bad consolation prize - Great Britain on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The obvious defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, in this form, Fiji would not have beaten a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, it is lost to Ryan every game in Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This mud will hurt, but progress is astounding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had begun wonderful and caused the attacks to be taken out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., when one would run into running busses. the World Series winners were 5-0 upwards, above Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes playing game Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely took the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hepaced tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone to attained a third goal, but Fiji only stopped to stop.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua ran a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the goodbye and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preformed a lot of weak shacklings of the GB team and rushed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">Conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like Fiji was not born to play the 7, while UK still loses.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB completed basic changes in half-time through and closed the fiduic gap... for quite four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half times, until Joshua Tuisova went through to a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a study for UK, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game went long in favour of the South Sea sulans, whose fans cheeks, banners and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fiduff "sounded the Fijis, and the UK, knocked down, knocked down into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the days, Fiji had conquered Japan in the semifinal with 20-5 and the Great Britain hit the difference in a tight sedition match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown already put the buks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive foot work and scored a door among the posts in the second half.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through fight with the cancer of the Trainers' cracker</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no engine charged with gold as they play, and this will be what you want.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes until the last, 220 hard hove that enters History, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams was there for the second Olympic champion in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, who took such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter is beaten, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins who are over the surface with the elegance of swarf, which does not reflect the type of triumphs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing, a battalion of willing helpers are contributing to the incremental progress which make the difference and there was no one more valuable than the trainer, which before 30 months did not know whether he was diagnosed this day if it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky what risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, it is spreading everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky enough he could begin at the beginning of 2014, out of season, so he could begin to keep the break at a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the correct word.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it had to go again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran at station around - 20 feet, 30 feet to a time when they said that some steps were enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing itself is a challenge, but this makes it one even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inability of victory their first thought went to Williams, who spent a nergies in the morning, trying to talk little more than otherwise and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, the centurion in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have a better person to trainers or better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams started to start in New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "pale in the process," lasting in the process. "</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to let not join.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do something fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventure of Steve Backstroke.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I did not want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realise that I'm a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="11">IG Metall greeted the agreement in Germany with the European Commission to become self-producing.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp escorted her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's school she did her subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I'm moving - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels happy, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">She doesn't do anything else beside her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal in several perspectives, a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackers from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in chorus and share with peminded people the joy of music, describes Hackers.</seg>
<seg id="8">By being regular, senior citizens can establish social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and familiar structures remain at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>

<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the elderly people train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who calls his lungs regularly, does not get so fast from the purest in daily life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">To elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Community of the Seniors Organizers.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common Singen had a high priority value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening to songs by older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and especially melodies, dementia themselves obscured for long recallied events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone so do not focus only on himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through singing in the chorus, means a hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem will also grow through singing in the chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show themselves, if I have long for something, I will strengthen better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means little talent, betrat Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - with 50 people who hear, who hears it when a sound goes right next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offering, seniors have various options, says Hackers.</seg>
<seg id="30">A person sing from the circle in an old matory itself, you can just connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many people you find also on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors will ask for the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should be in a chorus, beamer Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or social networks.</seg>

<seg id="30">That is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspicious attacks on asylum seekers were previously unknown against criminals, politically motivated offences or supporters of the right scene.</seg>

<seg id="17">Schmidt: "for these extraordinary expenditure, the continued care and maintenance costs came into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies for electricity costs which were significantly below the current level during the previous year of calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat tells that this filter is anime inspired, but some observers say that it is incredibly sensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With his filter tool, it enables us to alter about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already bordered to the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a painting from a Roy Lichtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unblossomed, standalone tools that produce more than 30 million more rare per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All maltrates are to be addressed to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been drawn in the past critique in which they were accused of propagate the Blackface App or the white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">As this week passed a filter, who gave them slums, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, there were some critics a racial caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repetitive topusses indicated a major problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The messages and the outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and motherboard, a day after snapshots provided it would have turned off.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company provided an excuse: the filter was used as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outstanding, having experienced racissmus, the filter reminded of violating clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some refused to draw the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American student of art, whose tweet was widely used on the photos that the filter "immacious and bundled was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it's difficult to argue with the opposite of a very resistible Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter has not been secured, but that the yellowing of the shade has become extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that they crossed the cultural heritage.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration battle, of conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment that we all hold in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great crowd of young people - which are similar to race of several characters as their older counter players - could rather expect to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of snapshots are generated such a picture, so it is much more difficult for a user, "so it was much more difficult that such matters remain unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu went to collaborate as a product manager and engineer for media to eradicate their Snapchat accounts, and asked for others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a discussion for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racially-related controversies would reflect a lack of diversity in the experience practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the great part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they do not have various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce," she said, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint which has largely unanswered to the Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on diversity of its workforce, and points to its status as private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, they refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently set up a HR officer that focuses on sub-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu saw that she is locked up their Snapchat accounts, and added, "I wonder if they need more user like us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command revised ordinarily to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and in Syria as it would have been allowed to report the actual conditions of Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a task force the republican members of the military commission, reported by great discontent among Central Command Secret Services cysts, reported how superiors reported their assessments to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"message-service information given by senior CentCom Commander in typically a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have been allowed to share the actual states on site and were thoroughly positive as analyses of other news services," quoted a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom, is unacceptable - our soldiers will be present if bad analytics are presented by our policy leaders," asked Ken Calvert, republican member of the Representative residence.</seg>
<seg id="7">The CentCom activities range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that Obama given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their counterlaws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions, and statements before the Congress had clearly positive than comparing the facts." the report was established.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom has publicly announced that a military return from Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, republican Congress of Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the peak of Central Command introduced the downturn reports to shut down the risk by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts agree with the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom accounts are going through the general inspectorate of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic Members of the News Service Committee published their findings on Thursday that agreed on some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created a revised process for creating retroevaluations on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," was announced as a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B., in a statement of opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, so Mr. ship, "delayed the publication of divine service reports," proclaimed the morals under analysts and "excessive little room for differing opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no notice to having found some evidence of the White House at CentCom analysts on a "certain political mind".</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast" on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="23">In August, the New York Times reported by the Pentagon's Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, admitted to complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press precher of the Pentagon, gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment the Congress, while the investigation of the general inspector would still be underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have setbacks on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have rejected the question, although President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest inclusion of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the Islamist state remind us of the torture of more than ten years ago, when an CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, was described as a small occupying force in Iraq as well as a little while on the recommendations of many analysts, looking at the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker announced that Mr. Hooker had no significant impact on terrorist attacks against the terrorist affairs of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had been put into operation, since these provisional refineries had been put into operation, in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this finding was not published, the Times was reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative Council due to his excessive positive assessment of the war on a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which the two will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place is placed a little longer in the path that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story, four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 squares.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a hockey stick in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel university), with 16 years she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, since they could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which she went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things into better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workplace in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely disrupted the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gentry in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the game, but the team showed a surprising and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until the game took place in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and invited the ball in the gate to obtain a 2-0 guided tour.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last district.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">As well as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is when the olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is looped from the wristlet to the Turner of the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a paper or listen to the coffee in the queue without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Leecy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's sling with dimples, should have been shown below this well known name, built by sponsors and feel TV advertising where he would be a swimmers, Turner, or even Feeders.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are sports which are not generally recognized: air pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastfeeding and may have long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I do modest arguments in my particular favorite should make me divert attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had been an Olympic event since 2000, the last 16 years had noticed so many people that I had questioned, it didn't know that it is an olympic event at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA got the competition for the competition, it has never gained a medal in jumping and has had a athletes who had made it for the final round of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping is a certain outsider, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear matching for a clownsschool as that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristical potential - the cartoonist trembling of his never-reaching upswing - but also the charm of the gym and pastures, the two sports which essentially joined them.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" is from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising conquerships jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hues and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to the official olympic series after accomplishment, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in the Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest to go forward to gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not chase only the finish line or the main wall, but in the television broadcast an additional Croatian objective: the world or the Olympic ords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic, and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think about watching these games as something exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she stooped, seemingly heavios as an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant imminent of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be played at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming for 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably oversee in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the increase of consciousness can be achieved only by the procure and object of male athletes - as it struck the male US Turner, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley awaits his flying, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation of Protestant" in Ethiopia, Long a ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are based on violent protest against the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that the protesters were killed during clashes with the police at Schussani.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just watching it?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid part of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook off the country and expanded it in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and requested fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights, the response of the government was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses indicated that policemen were shot and killed on some armed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos include the protests, presumably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security professionals strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now requires an incoming inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this land again and in future, it will even be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa the International Crisis Group, one research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get as much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in considerable speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pendulum in Addis Abeba capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - Human rights organisations have continued to suppress the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, with dissidents needed to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wideness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you press people and they don't have any other options except to protest there," said Seeyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth were protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous discomforts that cover everything from the ground up to the stranglehold in relation to power of ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following an extensive election of last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the final seat of the opposition and now 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions go along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this controversial line undertook hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts believe that separatists as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were in the last years more or less forced to use the turmoil and rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of distorbiting after years of infankles under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smart phones were increasingly more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government stops the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, particularly in protests, many people can still communicate across the Internet proxies where they can stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were so gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Orocomos and Amharas, the two biggest hernia in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orocomos and Amharas are not a natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äons prospered the amharas, that come from Äthopia mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, as they explode the Orocoes, many of which are Muslims and live in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Orochi have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by unfair members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, accounting for around 6 percent of the population, dominant in intelligence, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for turbulences is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a widely publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactic genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially committed to perceive early signs of discontent and to use special officers to work opponent and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict of conflict.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailleariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively intransparent grounds to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came out of the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailleariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands against elections, which had apparently been adopted by the government according to analytics, was subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razvants many protest has been killed, even if there were fewer than in the past months and that time of turbulence ran relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts from Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendulum of infrastructure, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty abatement.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misart of Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethics.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protestants held in Gondar, a amharan city, run by Tigray and the hass against the Tigray becomes more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the U.S. and other western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">Ethiopia also used the American government as a basis for droneous flights over the neighbors Somalia, even though it was recently agreed that it closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West will definitely want to support democracy, he does not want to combine his ally in a volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin congratulations."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim to Obama was founded on ISIS 'sarcasm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday that his campaign filed repeatedly, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founders" of the Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification designed new questions concerning the communication skills of the presidential candidate, whether he be able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellows, which endeavour to take him during an eventful phase of protection to explain which he might not have meant that he could not meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made a statement on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump threw back in relation to the assertion on Thursday and was in interviews to suggest that he really didn't intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mr. Trump spoke in an early morning tweet on Friday, he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he thought the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help weaken the statement refusal to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the republican candidate does not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of critique came down to Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign for falling issues on economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Being aware of Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher tax and found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he went on strong criticism, as he supposed, the Russians should suing Mrs. Clintons's emails, but he said later, "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic borders in politics and then back to recruiting demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how to get certain messages from his fans as they arrive, and then where appropriate," said "according to what is reaction." said Ruth Sherman, a communication cable that observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vage enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the Presidential elections, Mr. Trump led an even more corrosive tone, as its reversing declined to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, published on Friday, showed a guided tour in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump seeks not to excuse himself for his provocative declarations, he often accused his critics, to misuse his statements and to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is reinforced during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal Mitstrel into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements must be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advances, was able to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments, so he said to the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had created the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it background banners, completely false and hence it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republican try to argue that Mrs. Clinton served as an outdoor minister, ISIS allowed himself to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before his election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump put his attacks on the media and cast them back on any of his words and be preoccupied with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the "poor, jumpy" television experts who try to understand and said, "You can't know!."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats wiped over Mr. Trump's excuse as merely a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressive food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">For foodies, President Roosevelt was a faible for refined refinement at Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de Foie gras and Maryland Waterproof soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people," said Jane Zbriman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "she was also a message to the Americans, as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last book "Chop Suey" was written by the Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book "97 Orchard" about living in a home in the Lower East Side from the perspective of food.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest cooperation, "An decent meal," published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the story of the American kitchen during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, schnörkellosem Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, put a fresh cheeses with olive oil while coe, 57, turkey, with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When reporter finished Hackney, this found the couple of discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food were very popular," said Zbriman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, meat loaf and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap, extending the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinnest.</seg>
<seg id="18">"he has to have put oneself in the stomach as lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In front of the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat-Buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women coves for male colleagues and it was served fresh baked pie for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans that sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" shows the roads with which the country went on to be no longer the Cockaigne.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans a central, united topic," promised Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Similarly tense was the new budget: mysterious food such as breads and Kasseroles became basic food containing the casserole as a "wonderful way to remark food, as it could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American kitchen for years, has become a rarely preservated luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixing were tested, as a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority in front of taste or even healthy food processor.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which includes recipes, brick houses prepared a dish from this era, fried onions, peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it wasn't a popular additive at the midday," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zbrimann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the laundry recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since then, exaggerated budgets - including Louise Stanley, leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country derless.</seg>
<seg id="33">In order to make recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become budgetary spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historic delicacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially tasty are the reports of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-cake-eating.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke about the millions of millions in the world from which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked a continental kitchen like fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a very gilded dining room and got a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a glorious alien.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake, when not his wife Eleanor had asked him to statute a stamp with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, one housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House prepared the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most trousers prepared. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland shark: the oldest spine is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönland haie usually come only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark went back to the sea after a research on board the ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swimming with a good 1 km / h across the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönland sharks receive only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Grönland shark floats on the ground of the North Atlantic coast, in an hour he comes on average just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just when it really counts, accelerating the five meters long beast up to 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle appeared from long-term, but seems to be a bullet for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case, by a Greenland-shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schrublein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the Evolutionary biologist expected long, that Gröna haie are cobalt.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönland haie are hard to observe, lastly they live mainly at the polar sea in the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the lifestyle of the Grönland haie we know correspondingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">You have droped your time when they chose six animals with a broadcaster in front of the top.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks are nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">You may chase them sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for Kadaver, the water layers below.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-sharks, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 of it was 502.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method to the lens core of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already being revived before the birth of the sharks, which are not renewed in it later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had striking a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons try to kill larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast, at 220 ctimeters long, the lenticore contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lenticles, which occur through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, carbon-14-Clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeters, while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Grönbhai-females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because one of the animals with 392 centimeters may well stand on the threshold to sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Gröna sharks with the multiplication clearly become at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">To live such methusaleme, especially in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Grönland cow, in whose bacon, baked a 120 year-old harpoon tip, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because of the low temperatures often the organism living animals are often living on sparflame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they grow later - and grow slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in cold water, the animals are also very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal is ironed.</seg>
<seg id="39">The thermal loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than at a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants possible early as possible," explains the Evolutionbiologist Schurelein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt benefits from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">That is why the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies in London, Dublin and Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is likely that Frankfurt have benefited most of the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtner, head of the Competence Field Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is unlikely to continue to operate any monetary policy from London in the EU's financial transactions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Approval in the UK so far is sufficient for the so-called EU-pass.</seg>
<seg id="6">They just use great US banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced to store jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobbying association "Frankfurt Main Finance" anticipates 10,000 new jobs at the Main in five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, the IW, the registered office of the European Central Bank (ECB), is responsible for monetary policy and oversight on the largest banks of the eurozone, as well as other important authorities like European insurance coverage EIOPA and the Risk Consultant ESRB.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), however, is less important for the financial industry than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to the staff is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW professor Voigtner.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Luxembourg, a large fund sector is occupied, but also as Dublin return in infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thanks to its large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Further points of the city with easy access to commercial real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Paris, it's not that easy to find free high quality offices," says Voigtner.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the Seine, the rent for first-class commercial real estate property are 50 percent higher than the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less criminality.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of the business consultancy Mercer the town stood at square seven, Luxembourg at No. 19, Dublin at No.33 and Paris in 37th place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if the quality of life is a question of preference: "Frankfurt would attract further banks and investors with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market."</seg>
<seg id="20">But in spite of Brexit's vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="21">The correlation has also spoken: in London, according to figures of the Landesbank Helaba, in the end of 2015, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector, in Frankfurt there were 62500.</seg>

<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been abolished, the interest in sites of Russian companies in the country grew strongly, the ambassador allowed them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies established existing connections with Iran, while new firms are ready to provide access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Naturally, the further commercial building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="6">It realized that the trade rate between Russia and Iran saw in the first five months of 2016 by 70,9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $856 million in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, the Russian imports climbed by 91.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade break was achieved by deliveries of machines, engines and weapons, "said the Ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan goes to Russia for this year, a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, Russian colonization consisted of some 35,000 visas, primarily in Reisevisas, on Iranian citizens.</seg>

<seg id="13">You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken by the last year, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something of which the ambassador hopes to change it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit of the Eyepal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a walk on a four-day walk from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were made.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period till the next Roman pilgrimage of all the ministers in two years, the Oberministary Round St. Anna has decided to prepare for the preparation and implementation of a several day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year, several pilgrimage objectives were tested and decided at last for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year's mercy was opened to commemorate mercy with the opened gate of Mercy at the Freiburger Münster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and Heiligenstadt set on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, the priest of Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and divided the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">Von Horb was driven by rail to the Villingen starting point where also a Muenster age-loved lady was, and so the pilgrimage was taken away by Muenster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were interlured in the morning and evening, depending on a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and fonts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the Minis of march, chapels or churches were always raining for a song to sing together with a song from specially assembled pilgrim-songs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scotsotte Callum Skinner storms right at home, as Brit Gold for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner most recent evening in the men's team-sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy took himself to Eigen and made the legend haughty when he was going home to enter a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in London, despite the withdrawal of Hoys, in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time when it appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man, with whom they stayed when they witnessed potential in the villi, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hind, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy Victorious - and Skinner set a Olympic champion in qualifying rounds, but in their stand rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hind was just back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team in front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of transformation, with the execution of a higher gear to slow down and make it Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as the BBC expert, Skinner, Kenny and Hind fell as they climbed on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We placed an Olympic champion in the final round and conquered the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the page Kennys and Hoys, Hinder announced that he fell straight into the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection from England Rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">There was no such problem with such a victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said, "The whole GB flags on the grandstand will feel like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly with so many world titles that it was amazing to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days at the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys, it is in the range of possible that he repeats the victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on the 23rd of March (a seemingly holistic date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which will start today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels too lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said, "If he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medallists in the day, but there were still good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, won in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first round of the competition will take place on the second day of the competition on the second day of the competition on the Wiggins.</seg>
<seg id="42">He fought yesterday with preaching, when they called the officials to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the event that will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura drat, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world records from 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong platform team to dominate the central period of the Olympic Games and to take a band on medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional display of absolute domination in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio fell down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It also played out in the background, so the resignation of the Shane Sutton technical leader in April, amidst sexual muscles and bulbinges, as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks quite afterwards, as it could be a legendary call to meet the perfect moment of reaching its culmination, again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of melt from Portland, based on the uplift of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts from Portland, Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - stand in the game since the system operator will cancel the energy supplier and thus proclaim all delivery agreements as provided by the energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision by the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to be put into operation.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are up to 2000 jobs in the plant of ALCOA in Portland line of the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs direct and indirect - may be at risk for a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could occur too domino effect, as the melt around 10 percent of total electricity generation Victoria is consumed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, ALCOA closed the Point Henry melting, which led to a closure of the Anglesian power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of ALCOA in Portland loses money and risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the year-long speculation in the future of the plant, originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium scrap with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe, spread out that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is located in a majority owned by ALCOA and Alumina from which the Chinese Company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland, which means a further physical demand for power through the melt," divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continues to announce that the Treaties were so called "backup transactions," which should have entered into force as of November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The treaties have a 12 months notice period so that they will end 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL assumes that the contracts in the business year 17 may contribute to the revenue," said the electricity suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL's income from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale and retail prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared that it already subscribed the value of the contracts to an amount of $187 million in "expecting a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">ALCOA said that the decision to book the Treaties to power the Treaties of Alcoas... to operate the melt and to guarantee the power supply of the melt. "</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have come into force from November this year, even if there is still another statement, why it has withdrawn from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts were warn because of the bad economic conditions of the branch before the possible end of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland would consume around 600 MW and Tomago about 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">In case both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us, it would not be good for us, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents virtually every birthday episode of a children's return (Seacant brought the sentence, "You thought that we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a character set at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls play any of this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began with safety.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bandera large sister Kim might have liked what the Vogue cover is concerned (they and her husband Kanye West were supposed to see this in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine issue is a league for himself.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of their generation - under the former category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons, or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (even if it is hopeful about it).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, was published by the release of Lemonade in one of the most successful years of their career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners doesn't like success anyone.</seg>

<seg id="2">Online e-mail and internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, the successor dominate the world - its manufacturer had a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, it was therefore not good at hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite bulous.</seg>
<seg id="7">Initially, the built-in memory was eight Megabytes, which would range today for about two rare ones with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was born exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the business and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the age-era of the newspaper age.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone maker had previously announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as "office in Western Europe."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the time standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received by fax, the Communicator was too high.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible with HTML browser, albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen were found.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, for example 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could guess that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era in August 1996.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile division of Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and managed on Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market dominates suppliers that all came a lot later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere be online, that is today for a lot of people everyday.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Approximately 1.4 billion devices have been sold, Samsung and Apple are around 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">Global turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">These are the well running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications company.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the meantime, around the smartphone has grown a whole industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac-World the introduction of the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communication, everything is easy to use via touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphal march began, even today, the company's most important product is the Group's most important product.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola, Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the watch.</seg>
<seg id="35">She finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">These days now have Apple and Asian providers as Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is an understandby for 20 years after his invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average, every German car at the age of 88 looks to his mobile phone for 88 times.</seg>
<seg id="39">"we all have to learn to get the smartphone even again," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens executive board for personnel.</seg>
<seg id="40">Permanent accessibility is now considered as a curse and blessing.</seg>

<seg id="3">For me, this was the largest attraction of Heathrow, as well as in 2012 in London when we run a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from playing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics presented great advantages to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And we will achieve new possibilities by adding new opportunities for local companies in the vicinity of Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">We alone make 10.000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs, create an end to 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead in London 2012, there will be such a thing that the challenge of enlargement Heathrows is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamusing on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answered every question every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 bn to achieve healthy growth and a legacy of capabilities and jobs to be left as well as in all the UK.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third mileage, which is supported by £16 billion at private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London's London Olympics were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow is also one.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim lay in the middle of the night on the freeway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police invoke witnesses after a woman took refuge in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspect suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman came in the dark in an act of despair "in the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>

<seg id="9">A preliminary proceedings were opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a conflict avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">That is something the prosecutor had to decide, "said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers will not be held to responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - with which one person ran out in the dark on the freeway - was decided that the drivers must not assume that a pedestrians run right at night on the freeway as it was in the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate change, Venus probably was habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus by tools and algorithms that resemble from climatic researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have identified with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-based ambiance once.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously thought that the slow movement of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, yet-like atmosphere and slowly discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet is believed to have more dry areas as well as earth, but once had enough water and geographic variety to accommodate life and protective for rapid degradation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow re-turning of the sun becomes almost two months long," explained by GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer clouds, which acts as an umbrella to prevent the surface from a large part of the parasols.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees of cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously thought by planet research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable for once, the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporate and her water vapor was burned off by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When you deposited Hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind - the Venus, which we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="4">"wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to remark the handling process of the current path," says it in a common statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will stop several full day sessions in the coming weeks, which will start next year to restart the problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The unions said that their last strike, who is the first in over 25 years, would be a protest against possible wage abbreviations of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contrasts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market print.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's rating reduction follows a 10 percent decline in onshore companies in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that additional cuts to the company have the required space to break through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">For its part of thousands of people, Shell has announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its range of activities with the British energy company BG Group.</seg>

<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be massively, whereas faster rotors tend to be, very light stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the starbase of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the same qualities as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the Pleiades of the Pleiades offers a anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: as perfide erpressen hackers chipper their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware attacking out specific companies at present - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware-and-specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, partly several times of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the aim of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims paid willingly to accept the impurities required by the offenders to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The criminals specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes deliberately to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they succeed, the potential to obtain resolution are significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying quick evolution of the malware software," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders rediscovered software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks had been scary quickly during the last months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim active, they search targeted to unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards, the software introduces the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the repository code to the files, the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of the cryptosses Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users can manage the personal photo database on the game, companies develop sensitive customer data or project databases, without standing the production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls if a ransomware beat.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of all German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had to be completely undercut, in such a case people were in risk of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were already victims of attacks to risk patients affected by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pay not, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies have to pay their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study, the security researchers of F-Secure investigates the user surface and the contact with blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to set up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their sacrifices by chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites, or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals dissolves to payments of only a few hundred Euro, companies have to negotiate hard and get five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware extortion, hackers are always professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the Antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write about a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely, however, that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their harmful software in the form of a software building to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits was created by malware themselves, counseling and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a tool, allowing smaller configuration, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then look for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log into one of the forums, buys the set of a criminal and asks for another order to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is performed per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"normally, the criminals register spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Today, the risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT department in the Malwarebytes survey trust that ransomware can be used with file-back ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Consequently the offenders retrace already new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not constitute adequate threat to successful savings, the perpetrators, instead with the release of sensitive data such as account of customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda still wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually proved very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers carried a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The indoor habitat's materials are well processed and comfortable, only the cockpit-top falls slightly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l and 1026 l of the back armrests, but it gives the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">That's less magical as it sounds: the seat areas of the rear can be folded like chin boilers and thus provide storage space that is up to a height of 1,24 m from the ground up to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, but the load-height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in a wide speed range.</seg>
<seg id="12">His work should be somewhat quieter, however.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering system should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment is open to the tested Top-variant "Executive," doesn't have any wishes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The city-emergency braking system is one of the safety systems (works upto 32), the collision system and the track-assistent.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision alert sometimes confuses, because he controls many obstacles as "herding objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">A very reliable work of remote assistance.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart temperature regulator works on the road recognition and throttle the speed when necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and a HDMI connector lie under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest in such a way will receive the fuel from 20,000 Euro, the diesel of 23000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow at the highway toll road</seg>
<seg id="2">It is checked regularly on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that should change: the right turns shall be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is good news for all the car drivers who are standing in traffic on the surrounding street every evening in Stau, if they are going through the motorway (A 43).</seg>

<seg id="16">However, it is worth reckoned with years: because the bridge has an official rest of life up to 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one gets around forever, in the morning it is enough for hours, but in the morning it is not enough to think of sleep anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep very often or permanently.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes may be based on them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board member of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whatever you understand, the insomnia is, thus an infeed and sleeping trouble.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially those who sleep through, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Hauser association with practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep changes are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, mental or behavioral-related factors can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disturbing expression of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake-up is common especially for depression often," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whoever has a herniated disc could lie badly, every two to three hours wakes up, and perhaps swallow up, about everyday problems and worms, gives up an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep with sleep changes to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who doesn't sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is impaired on the day, should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look very different: it is shattered, tired, imprint, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood disorders, or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep disturbances it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other treatment options include, among other things, cognitive Behavior or drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there are hardly imaginative sleep in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary centre of Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first turn to sleep at bedtime at bedtime, betrat Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">May clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in sleep laboratory, for example with snoring with respiratory sufferers, in case of disease defects, or if you cannot find the cause of a diardisorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It doesn't really have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a nap," Fietze says.</seg>
<seg id="30">After wired one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one is wearing a nose chest, a chest strap and a cowl on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera will sleep back on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can individual problems get involved in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of actuators where you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleep and downtimes, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleeping, drinking alcohol and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to pay straight away, and that is absolutely not favorable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some limestone blocks, meanwhile a rest of the cobbled stones: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not affect the first glance, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk along the street from the east to the west, one gets lost on playing places, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone has "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a gray house. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which will also be pulled down soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district," how the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, is clearly illustrated in the last few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was busy, now the residents are occupied, but there are rooms in the ground floor and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inside of the building bears several times for stubborn police against the project, the area known as "No-Go Zone," for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, were reportedly patended with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked off parts of the road and maintained visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown owners, the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later police and building workers came under the itch of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">This summer afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late Saäti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects, a primary school and kindergartens are located.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who grew up here three children, are particularly generic above all about the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects, they occupy the care of increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wished to produce repeated police-coat in front of a andalous Left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The tomat, which of the Berlin wall and the cops were somewhere between squandering and their neighbors, obviously not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average and high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many buildings and the native residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire maz street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police officers in a downright street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and still inhabited by people today, which they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly popular for tourists and polliners from all over the world: with them native people from the GDR and former house owned their Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rent, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize it on collected discs, or freshly painted faces, which were subjected to gradients.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned so often along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for this, that not all neighbors who should see this as a problem might be that they are not impacted by crime: offences like body injury, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make objections from those who tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there cannot be any talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is an important thing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who would not have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars can give it directly in the rigs no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For studying architecin, her road is not a crime focal point, on the contrary: "here one can fight each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Reborn is consciously moved into the Rigaer Straße - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that local residents got back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the dewareness of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of reinhabitants like Neugebauer, the road continues to leave them: by gesless new built in former buildings that displace ancient inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately furnished apartments which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not as well cared for," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not guist violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone else is listening to?</seg>
<seg id="36">Sitting on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has spared little understanding for Zuzogengene, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the pines.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever draws, should be aware of his - just like someone who moves into a kneipp district to complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time being very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">Management is de facto the management of any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it has not been working on private apartments, so deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore common apartments have to be considered as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers will soon be placed in the basin road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are regine customer and annika deuschle included.</seg>
<seg id="30">Besides a solid lead, practicing places, training places, school-places, one-euro jobs and foreign activities for migrants and migrants, must be undundated or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do not profit work - and that's motivation and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But he does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a feeling of jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with native people, and mainly language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus, managing and honor of honor jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was central that the refugees obtain the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to explain the refugees that it just takes and allows them to bridge the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever wants to develop the feeling he could not be unable to work in Urbach, he might not work and be unprofitable which will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no problem cases, but customer is honest, "people who are doing nothing at all." the work of Deuschle and customer may always motivate others to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">This is all a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach, too?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the helpers are already suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would be afraid that the attacks bring them complete into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want us to show that they have nothing to do with them," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So we must look for basic and honor on the site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new store on refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the politics are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go there," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also appreciates that the Urbacher had already been utilized so that earlier people are rational to rational.</seg>
<seg id="63">They are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in distress, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
