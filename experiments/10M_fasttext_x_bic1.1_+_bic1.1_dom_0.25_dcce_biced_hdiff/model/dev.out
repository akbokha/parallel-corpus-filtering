Obama received a Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very easy .
they wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Teh@@ eran &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but in the encounter there should also be a conflict with the Palest@@ in@@ ians and the discussed two @-@ States solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is looking forward for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of commitment to the peace process .
through the deal raised by Obama to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu was invited to invitation a controversial speech before the US Congress which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
Obama was not talking to Obama , a meeting had rejected this meeting with regard to the upcoming election in Israel .
in a call to have a professor to have shot his girlfriend
in a emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told with a bit of wit@@ ching voice of the police , that he had shot his girlfriend and would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile .
inside the house , officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that I had raised to a white block . &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved Amy and she is the only woman ever loved . &quot; this stood by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb appearing in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled to 300 miles to the school complex , where he was shot to a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot at the door to his office .
Delta State University of Police @-@ chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the general staff has heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the dre@@ ary emergency .
by the end of the day , there was another death : he accepted life when police en@@ cir@@ cled it .
a day after shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of them which Lamb motivated .
details published by the medi@@ ators on both ends of the state , as did the students who knew him , helped him to draw an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background .
Schmidt was mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both built in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose fac@@ ulty members 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , who knew Lamb , seemed to be a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; like something wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously requested the Delta State University to provide a ur@@ king for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in employment policy of the university found that the Lamb had worked hard for the Lamb so hard for him , to accept it for an automatic way as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Mind . &quot;
these are questions , which Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after escape from the Campus police found the police later Lam@@ bs gauge , when he entered Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ark@@ ansas .
before he was arrested , Lamb slain himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that they knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , with 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education .
he received his doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
one of the long@@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla L@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar .
he was the women &apos;s black back then .
all the girls mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I had killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that bor@@ dering a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , said they were left 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who had been 19 years old now .
&quot; it was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en &quot; said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met Lamb , but he heard about his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ un@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago , both in a summer year@@ ling .
later they played along the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , His daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ un@@ iss was a nurse , which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes Entertainment Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar close to G@@ auti@@ er , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ bite Night in the night of 5th September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ies before a sp@@ aw@@ ful audience .
there was no indication for anything , that something did not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the up@@ sc@@ oop and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first @-@ term seminar program and speci@@ alizes in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , where he became president of his Brotherhood and students .
on Tuesday evening , approximately 900 people attended the Delta State campus in C@@ lev@@ eland , including lecturer , staff , students and members of the community at a candle @-@ light commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vig@@ il , while &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace . &quot;
the class will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is one day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from C@@ lev@@ eland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press authors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected so that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency . after he had shot the emergency , and that lamb in his emergency call cho@@ oses his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married .

Michael J. Fox publishes over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it is becoming clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in my mind that I &apos;m a sim@@ ulated gate and a mes@@ hing length of it , with the princess of Wales to be with a date .

UN Secretary says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon says , his reply to Russia is reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of permanent conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN chief ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the Council meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the divisions of the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
B@@ an ordered the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity upon addressing the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in compliance with Iran .
8 Re@@ fra@@ gment values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
however , no matter how some Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top margin in surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national pol@@ ls carried out Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to look seriously about what it means for the odds of the nom@@ ination of the real estate market .
of course it is too early in the election season .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that at that time Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was released at the Asc@@ ent Herman Cain , one of whom won &apos;t only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but outer groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ es Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now detect tr@@ umps disper@@ sed and begin to flow out their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some of the current surveys that suggest that the Real Estate in Mog@@ ul is not merely a temporary phase :
Tr@@ ump Popular levels have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump comm@@ ended his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate in Mog@@ ul .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in the early States .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ tuning in I@@ owa discovered last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ v@@ oters were happy with ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the rep@@ ubli@@ can , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; content , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son produces about the same passion as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent ) , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent ( saying the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 % of the rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters tell that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed them if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite part of the establishment .
a majority of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tr@@ ump temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is critic@@ ized for his bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ulting statements , 52 percent of the Irish v@@ oters think that the Real Estate in Mog@@ ul I have the right temper@@ ament for president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first vote state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can think he has the personality to a commander @-@ in , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to perform effectively his office and to say almost six out of 10 inno@@ c@@ ence that his tem@@ per does not pas@@ se into the White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters get used to the idea .
when they put up their schol@@ ar , rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters think for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , the GO@@ P nom@@ ination will say , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
it is a change since the moment when four of ten released their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclos@@ ure : GO@@ P @-@ v@@ oters were not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination at just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ v@@ oters tr@@ umps campaign can be viewed as plau@@ sible .
even when the re@@ public@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump eating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the spl@@ inter@@ rupt field probably st@@ umps to tr@@ umps , while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen of other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ tains overall support .
he points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a cr@@ un@@ ty majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their mind .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T will show that only slightly more than half of the v@@ oters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have firmly given their voices .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 per cent said they let the door open , to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the most powerful compet@@ itor in the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but v@@ oters who have formed their mind are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in the issue of immig@@ ration .
since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign of Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump @-@ Americans will be remote by the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orient@@ ing efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immig@@ ration .
as long as the immig@@ ration is left in the spotlight , it will apparently also do Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration about the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters are lost , mainly through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey by ABC / Post , they prefer to use a political field as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa shows two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans would be fru@@ str@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ h@@ oods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ less complex is the most expensive residential complex - with view over the North Sea watt .
in the street , one square meter of a hom@@ eless house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt is the range of objects is limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows how special layers are the square meter most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top dwellings , one of the price does not come as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the estate service provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square prices in sh@@ read@@ iness prices .
there are several ten thousand euros of nothing - per square meter , thou@@ ght@@ ful .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
dual p@@ ush@@ ups in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a prosper@@ ous showing of Thomas Müller &apos;s way to the FC Bayern 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran it .
a so@@ vereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions @-@ League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have taken a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the witch &apos;s cottage .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off game in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to garbage dump double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th stage in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th , he received the Champions League to Bavaria @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper , who would pass one as a flan@@ k with World Champion in the Champions League .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; had promised Ms. Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot fans - and the Munich kept word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his most recent six home games in the pupp@@ y , among them against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
however , Bavaria , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , would not have to be the next victim .
they proce@@ eded brave , but with their obvious efforts , but often to be an einf@@ all@@ ess work .
the attacks were led too often by playing on the left Douglas Costa , who was rarely found against the previous Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck left than his flan@@ k in the left corner of the upper right of To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best occasions in half one .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown Brown &apos;s head ball struck the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeper were Roberto with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bavaria cle@@ ars their acc@@ laimed game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to put Piraeus .
but the keeper of Tor@@ ke@@ en Manuel Neuer was .
thus , as he directed a shot of Ide@@ a over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
new Gu@@ ardi@@ ola introduced a square with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the pool , sat at first outside .
the World Cup hero was given the green light after finishing the closing of the green light , &quot; he said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky , &quot; : &quot; those who want to do something else is v@@ icious . &quot;
in the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the hand@@ eliminated Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e was too late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and he made a distance of 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still another one .
before the game it was hit in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ all .
after a smaller group of mal@@ to@@ dated Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience block revealed the followers of hosts &apos; Piraeus with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and entered dir@@ ges against the Munich pendant .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
if you smoke , it &apos;s not only the lungs , but also the teeth - a Potsdam long term study .
the good news : for deci@@ ding the risk is rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a clearly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerges from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their teeth mat@@ urely to loose the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,6 @-@ F@@ ou@@ ache .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ izes DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth will therefore go back on frequent gum inflammation in smo@@ kers .
if smoking has not been clari@@ fied , smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped up smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , writing the researchers at the Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing returned to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained the first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich von der English University of Birmingham .
one must convince people of this , non @-@ smoking , explained study leader H@@ einer Boeing by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking is shortened to life . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to good denti@@ ality as well as to the high age .
over 20 percent of the population in Germany have affected more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have pointed out that smoking increased the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
archae@@ ologists to@@ ast the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the late antique country
for the repeated time on the right bank of Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne , archaeological finds have been made .

EU Commission proposes elections on TTIP a new court
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system into the TTIP free trade agreements TTIP to the TTIP free trade agreements TTIP .
the controversial private shower facilities for disputes between companies and corpor@@ ations should therefore be replaced by a transparent system which is significantly more traditional food in its way .
&quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; explained the responsible EU @-@ In@@ spec@@ tor Cecilia Malm@@ ström .
the Swe@@ de has to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
the biggest free trade zone in the world is set to emerge for 800 million people .
plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stip@@ ulated that the EU states and the US should select independent judges for a new investment fund .
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is fore@@ seen .
it would allow it to lev@@ y against jud@@ gements .
so far , the procedures involved are organised among the arbit@@ rators , a possibility to claim against their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

pasta al of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
in addition to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the gru@@ elling real folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt @-@ pin .

the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a pending series : each of the 50 US states should be discussed .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s President of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister &apos;s President of the Prime Minister .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s victory and made David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will lev@@ y , in order to ask the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is probably d@@ ited by the media , and the Labour M@@ EPs in the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could jump up some meetings to help colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , for it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow of shadow and after his speech at Tu@@ c meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime the Labour leader &apos;s decision to provo@@ ke the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the National An@@ them in silence in silence , criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS , and will be on the center of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attention to itself
a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; he had stood in respec@@ tful st@@ illness . &quot; and he didn &apos;t recognise the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ u@@ ine , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news@@ night programme , he advised the National An@@ them to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top team , and they appe@@ aled to dis@@ agreements during the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ ch says that political differences could also follow within the Labour &quot; foot@@ ing and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns to the position of the European Union and the limitation of win@@ nings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference , that Labour amendments have to be removed to remove all the idea of a del@@ im@@ itation .
hours later , Mr Smith , the Shadow labour and R@@ ents Ministers , said that the party is &quot; very clear , &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron &apos;s leader , since he has been a T@@ ory boss , in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another approach , says he &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 feedback .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is on a confron@@ t@@ onal and that it is carried out on both &quot; po@@ ck@@ ety &quot; and the streaming with resist@@ or and is purpos@@ ed to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers , will represent him when he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is on the road .
he also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the Word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he said goodbye to the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he said that he was failed .
since she was sent to TV in 1990 , the question@@ er was regarded as the most important barometer of the decision of a leader and his leadership in the sub @-@ house and his position among his par@@ liament@@ arians , though critics have argu@@ ed , had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pound increases by accelerated increase in the UK
the Po@@ unds went le@@ ap@@ tly after data showing an increase in the growth rate of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was set by the SA@@ BM@@ iller target .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period last year .
this percentage was the fastest and appreciated ass@@ ess@@ ments over the time of interest in the period 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar from $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump after the takeover of the R@@ ival AB In@@ Be@@ v had been received .

shares of G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E rose by 5 % after the re@@ build predic@@ ts that he took $ 2.5 billion as part of a stock exchange as part of his strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a decline by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell &quot; .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after having reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of Y@@ D Sports says that more wages are end@@ owed to expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more buying power in the pockets of the potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchase force will balance the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , added , and this might mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

P@@ EG@@ IDA poster prints Leban@@ ese in the potato @-@ woofer

inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the p@@ eg@@ ida @-@ movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato has placed potato and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea introduced him a poster with a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen randomly on television .
since then it turns into a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has meanwhile admitted to Lebanon by the Patent Office .
according to the agency , it has been protected as a utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ h@@ ay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .
only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he thinks .
even with its clients , the culinary journalist can also come well .
Met@@ cash starts floor re@@ pression campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A branches before an Al@@ di @-@ invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a floor space campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengthen met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through ma@@ inst@@ ream marketing and marketing via the Social Media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eis@@ manufacturer Simm@@ ons from Dun@@ s@@ borough , who distributed in IG@@ A @-@ stores samples and sell shop owners who sell association tickets to the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ si will publish more details of his defence strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ aler performs his annual investors strategy day out .
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia can make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ ia IG@@ A cargo business and generate higher profit margin as a Met@@ cas@@ hou@@ IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally Provincial and IG@@ A retailers have much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stanley , at the opening of his first markets , anal@@ ysts believe that Al@@ di will be taking off about five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all of the existing acc@@ ents , but mainly from independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stanley suggested that IG@@ A @-@ retailers can lose 360 $ million per year and met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food store and at the amounts on met@@ a @-@ high fixation base could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ pre @-@ earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market share in eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan came out that IG@@ A @-@ One are the faithful ones .
Morgan Stanley is expecting revenues in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was told by a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
in public , Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has been in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from metals in food and food trade , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , refle@@ cting the operating debt reduction in simultaneous print on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ aler rever@@ ts and invests more than $ 150 million in order to enhance sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week , to improve our shops with faster growing fresh food and provide a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ a &apos;s leading CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop management programs will get to Elan , and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ aler will return to profit in four years for the first time in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is always deser@@ ved praise for his behaviour .
Than@@ zi co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ating damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and ear@@ ns for the view of the President of Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always again known as &quot; Special KS &quot; , came through the not@@ ori@@ ous conflict of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters into the spotlight .
soon co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated from the refer@@ ee in a fiery qualification game where Harrison cried out : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have had to strike it , and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how to defeat a tennis bat , after a cr@@ amp reached a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von Heal@@ y def@@ ends .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single @-@ behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing I would deliver myself , is the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
he has broken up a bat as he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ er in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat of fru@@ stration with herself , and I know Than@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he has kept extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around itself , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old boy , he works very hard , and he adap@@ ts to the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players he is well trained , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ved to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision to take on the important decision on Friday that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long lasting element to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all of the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick made very fast the way of what he feels like Feder@@ er and Murray . he goes to the attention of his actions , but we try to think him that the consequences of his actions , I think , I think it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , close to the border , escap@@ es refugees
Hungary explains the emergency and ri@@ pped the border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept everyone who tried to stop illegal in the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos was followed at the border as hundreds of migrants grab@@ bed in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials .
the people who fled from violence , set tents for an unknown time on the street between the two control points of the country and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations climbed up .
when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried against the Hungarian polic@@ eman .
some people return on protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants were sent back from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision damage .
during the coming days , meetings with Brussels and other countries will be held , &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic to be in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended one day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who took refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would end up another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged the European Union to discuss the immig@@ ration crisis of the continent .
in Hungary , however , he did not claim his hopes to return to Brussels or from his neigh@@ bors .
the emergency number in two southern regions passed the authorities to cope with the crisis , so they could lock roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that his country also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even though in race , C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that the cross @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban however , however , passed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border , or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high @-@ storm , who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , for a crime . these laws apply to the traff@@ ic@@ kers for traff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; due to the situation that is created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree with the use of the military service , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters by Associated Press have already seen serious armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on day .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , the country &apos;s security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said to cross 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were deeply rooted in the country .
they come down by dam@@ aging the fence , but are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences .
authorities help repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials included two of the seven border cros@@ sings on Tuesday after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos announced the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of humans and sque@@ e@@ zed a crowd of people around there .
some 20 managed to occur , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the major motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would be food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton remained a two @-@ digit margin in the democratic race to nom@@ inate the nom@@ ination at national level but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins the floor .
Clinton now has the support of 47 % of the democratic v@@ oters in the previous elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is in second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den who hasn &apos;t spoken yet , will support 15 percent of the vote for the presidential elections .
more than five months before the pre @-@ election , most democratic v@@ oters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates would support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more continuous in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ Survey Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders had scored some gains .
Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and gem@@ s , but this jum@@ pr@@ un@@ ches have decreased .
their support with the men is significantly dimin@@ ished , and S@@ anders is just back with 5 d@@ ots .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s benefit with democratic citizens under the age of 50 have been at@@ tr@@ at@@ ised , and they are now at the same altitude .
but Clinton is still a big lead in the older v@@ oters .
last month , Clinton had a two @-@ digit lead to the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the v@@ oters in the country elections say that they would support with enthusiasm belonging to Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some pre@@ judi@@ ce and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candi@@ dat@@ in .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons is up @-@ to @-@ date supporters in particular by her .
the views are stronger bl@@ ended with those who currently does not support Clinton - just about one quarter would it enthusi@@ ast@@ ically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic v@@ oters want to say that Clinton talked about enthusiasm , little rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters do this about their top @-@ class data of Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Clin@@ tons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the Clinton &apos;s supporters , Bill Clinton is also mentioned in their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to deal with the problems and v@@ oters are also cited .
as the Vice President raises the potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic v@@ oters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic v@@ oters are asked of the elections , those who would have their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top .
from Hirslanden &apos;s followers more than half that Bi@@ den would have been the second election far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides to can@@ ni@@ ze for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ c@@ rats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead increases its lead , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race on 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic v@@ oters see Clinton as a candidate in the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has declined by 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den has by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
yet , with the question of what is more important in a Candi@@ date , Democratic v@@ oters have questions about the v@@ oters .
similarly as in the last month none of the only demo@@ c@@ rat@@ ch candidate or potential candidate for these v@@ oters are un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates take good results in some important traits for v@@ oters of their party elections .
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider ourselves honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead on the top of hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic v@@ oters do not believe that Clinton becomes honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic v@@ oters of the demonstration in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as having regard to Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s personal e @-@ mail address and a server in office as a foreign minister , most of the Democratic v@@ oters are pleased with their declar@@ ations of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions in total .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of Americans now is un@@ satisfied with their statement , while only a third is content .
public opinion this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans say that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated even worse .
there are mainly Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 , which say that their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the v@@ oters of its party , this is a problem for them under registered v@@ oters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less than in May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the elec@@ torate &apos;s elec@@ toral affairs should also be considered tru@@ thful and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump make good notes on leadership .
among the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush &apos;s best cut in hon@@ esty .
a majority looks quite differently than hon@@ estly , but as at Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic v@@ oters in the previous election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near the country alongside Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the support of v@@ oters rejected in the new pol@@ l , and others lose on hold .
rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey which was conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month in order to be 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son affects well over demo@@ graphic groups and exceeds rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ ich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who fell at the deepest and is now 2 % in the last month .
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e , and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the error rate in the sample sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can v@@ oters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % , and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in the pol@@ ls - with 19 % assistance in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump to Car@@ son .
having a look at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side panels for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ ump in question .

pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if maximum values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some is no longer going to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the north and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares .
bathing temperatures continue to the Mediterranean : in the east , it even occurs up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea , it is 25 degrees in France , and 23 degrees in France .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ring bur@@ dened
almost two years after a student at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an accused of violations of five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ gery interven@@ ed in September 2013 and delayed their transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police shared .
officials said that he had been loaded with band@@ aged eyes with a 30 pounds backpack of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while trying to go over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally accused head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned , and allegedly an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
they had the time to visit D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to give advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood started to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle over the creation of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning on his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repeatedly came with st@@ ammer on the head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in a declaration .
bro@@ ther@@ h@@ oods and their members need to be ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .

this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
an interest row comes , and the house shall be moved , ra@@ kes for bor@@ rowing , and the economy will gli@@ de in a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long will this take and how long it will be stopped .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only small instructions for the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ sion of the Federal Reserve at the start of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor as the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives from the U.S. Bank have so fier@@ c@@ ely stressed that investors not focus on it when it begins to increase interest rates but rather on the period , which is needed for norm@@ alization .
several variables play a role in fact .
however , in the end , market participants could determine that all the excitement was ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated due to an interest rate .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted in@@ inev@@ it@@ ably by some than a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to se@@ duce a lot to fear , to lead .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the removal of interest @-@ caves may make things for a while vol@@ at@@ ile .
as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to be cancelled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent survey to what is happening according to the inser@@ ts of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually in the last 35 years - mostly in the upward trend , quite flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal current after 500 days , with an average yield in the previous six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to an average analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , boss plant Commander at Nu@@ ron &apos;s , published .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tend to appear in the enh@@ ancements cycle later and the return on equity begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest @-@ caves often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ts with some terms that it did not exist before and could accelerate the recession .
the Gross Dom@@ estic Product is remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , among the 118 rate inser@@ ts since 1950 , nominal GDP had only been below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3,6 % , only a few expect this to continue and expect the third quarter to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
inser@@ ts in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and disc@@ lose the question , &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
the market participants have taken the whole year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many Strat@@ os and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures Trading remains only a 25 percent probability of interest .
&quot; in our study , all raising cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP and on rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ism very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadow , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is clearly a slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been serv@@ iced since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months now .
fixed income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , since the market gains a reasonable increase , and the pattern is rather similar in the capital market .
the main difference is that the effects of bonds faster than shares , if they are changing their strategic course .
in bonds , the edges appear to switch the direction soon as soon as the first increase in the cycle is done .
at the end of the increases cycle , the bond issues would fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the Strat@@ os of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in a closer and shorter bonds to result in the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although we are still auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting , Jones thinks that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
temporary interest rates have risen , the Er@@ trag@@ sk@@ er@@ ve has increased , bor@@ rowing costs have increased , and the Vol@@ at@@ ility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed deep@@ ens its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that have the greater part of their business activity in the US will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; equity tend to respond positively , three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts said in a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have surpassed the company with weak balance after each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ratios as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility with their shares also exceeded 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) respectively .
debts are a big problem .
company with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar outside the pure shar@@ ks .
savers could see gains due to higher yields , even if experts of varying opinion , how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM broadcast , says spokesperson Andrew B@@ ingham
con@@ servatives members of Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ c@@ aster because of his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to be distinguished by commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also targeted at the BBC Music Awards and said they would only im@@ itate The Br@@ its
parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Collins , the sending The Voice of the Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; into Classic FM &quot; is holding a leading parliamentary committee and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something that does not do something .
&quot; con@@ servatives , Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the non @-@ legal radio station &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ates &quot; and is increasingly impossible to distinguish from its commercial opponents .
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t just use the word &quot; suspic@@ ious &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM . &quot; he said .
it also aims at the BBC Music Awards , starting last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples of which you actually need to im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director denied the accus@@ ations that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial opponents when it comes to public music and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance .
what I am about to learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ surpassed .
&quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller hosted Alan Dav@@ ey that tough@@ er will work to engage in the past as it did so in the past because the Br@@ its are informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport came under fire to perform the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory dep@@ u@@ ties Dam@@ ien Collins , The Voice Department - the musical talent show of the BBC that was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall estimated that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Jud@@ ge - was produced &quot; on a special BBC manner . &quot;
he added , he wanted to find the company &quot; hit a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; when it was the next time a fun series .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of additional rows of The Voice in the future or to give money from the service pay@@ ers for different entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday may be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased 3 years ago through the use of mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November the spending has slow@@ ed
for over a decade the virtual shopping bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
yet , experts say that there are signs that the online sales have stag@@ n@@ ated after new numbers presented only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase in comparison to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales have stag@@ n@@ ated after new numbers reported only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and come back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG brochure , the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales started out three years ago , when buyers started working with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
but now this is true , and we may experience that growth will be dimin@@ ished .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a basis for subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers , to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites r@@ ushed down .
experts believe that Black Friday in which the buyer avo@@ red because of bar@@ gain , buyers can hold them shopping .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium revealed that £ 5 spending a little more than 1 £ online .
some products such as television and washing machines are now carried out more than one @-@ third of purchases now via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of men buying clo@@ ths and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident involving fat@@ alities - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 victims were caused by Muslims in the first bur@@ gl@@ ories in Mec@@ ca , through the streets
Saudi Arabia partially sets the collapse in part of the huge Saudi @-@ Bin Laden group .
the Ministry of Health said that altogether 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves to bury themselves when 29 of the victims were killed in the streets to bury the slain , when a crane crossed the cliff of Mec@@ ca .

the mour@@ ning ession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before was a building crane by the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed collap@@ sed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for bur@@ ial , when the Saudi King over the construction company Bin Laden , because of the catastrophe , who left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction suspended .
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed as a crane crossed by the Great Central Po@@ is@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram of Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who went on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was at the Great Mos@@ que in front of his parents &apos; yearly beginning .
Saudi &apos;s officials have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch is to Mec@@ ca with thousands , which will continue to go on to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group would not have missed the arm of the crane , as he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
in English , the news agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is not allowed to travel .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the crash of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ oh@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the H@@ add@@ sch who will take place later this month .
the Bin Laden group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the Crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also collected the group because of its current security measures and because they are not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .

the crash of the crane fell in a strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions of pilgrimage to the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims required .

thus , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , who are at art@@ isans and close 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment , men exceed the men .
she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households having more renovation than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this towards a balance .
generally , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 , has also converted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has filled exactly 50 percent of the team including women , including the management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - this is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher announces a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group announced the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches .
function of A@@ I / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity on trial
at the Provincial Court in Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian &apos;s volleyball court A@@ ich / D@@ ob must be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and supervision .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with counter@@ parts .
from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally uph@@ eld in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the previous examination , the def@@ endants appeared in 2006 to 2011 Gel@@ der of United States , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is equivalent to about 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial charges .
this fact was retired by the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Jud@@ ge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity the defense was not a part of any property that would not occur at the time .
the sports officials have only been reck@@ oned for allowance and the sports club , for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va was altogether around 600@@ .000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ ,000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : &apos; we carry the club on or lock ourselves ? , &quot; one of the accused , in the bread &apos;s famous audit@@ or of the financial centre .
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shed money to put our lives as security at the Bank , &quot; he said during the arrest .
unless agreed with the association , you can manage the money free , no debts may be made .
in case of such financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance exp@@ ires by 1991 was approved by 1991 .
therefore one part of the allowance was only years later , namely the year 2003 when a Plus was paid to the account that paid out .
therefore the l@@ ump sum - and not detailed fin@@ s seemed to be explained when the ex Ob@@ mann explained .
the accounts and spar@@ kl@@ books managed the two def@@ endants , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association was not explicitly imag@@ ined , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , as a result of official investigation for officials , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
the def@@ endants were , explained the accused .
this stock account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the testimony of the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge .
Wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on the in@@ quired did not know the answer .
then he supposed that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , no one could have known anything of that money , the pro@@ secutor set in the room .
the fellow said was confi@@ d@@ ently , re@@ lied the function@@ ary .
this transfer was &quot; formulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why harm ? , we wanted to know a judge and public pro@@ secutor .
the first accused declared that he had not agreed with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all from the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
in addition , the function@@ ary , he never employed a cent content , he merely charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets , he charged 1,000 euros per month to the club , but the actual effort was however much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the def@@ endants .
these were after a working trial , where everything has been judged correctly , they have not been kept , explained .
the second def@@ endant had also referred to mil@@ eage .
all the surveys are made in cash , along with it he had to lead from his residence in the bank of the Bank to Blei@@ burg , in his statement .
the trial will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard setup another 30.000 jobs
in addition to three years of continuous labor mining , the computer company will build further jobs during the development of the company .
the job vac@@ ations of the Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) are not able to find .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to grow from 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers .
in doing so , costs to be saved in amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) divided the company on Tuesday .
the step will result in a special burden of about $ 2.7 billion which will be dropped from the fourth quarter .
the exploitation of 55@@ ,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed .
HP employed approximately 30@@ 2,000 people at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year .
recently , the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share agreed 2.3 percent .
the computer and print shop boast a large @-@ scale group from California Palo Alto , to date : the computer and print shop is now to be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the future areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both commercial parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a later dis@@ appo@@ inting PC paragraph and a weaker demand of corporate customers after its services delivered the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers to Lenovo S@@ USS .
in the third quarter to the end of July , the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just about 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this returns the revenues to 15 of 16 quarters .
HP is respon@@ ding with a sec@@ ession and a massive job setting on changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the management of Me@@ g Whit@@ man only re@@ acts very late to customers to buy smart phones and tablets instead of conventional computers and always get more shops immediately .
in total , Whit@@ mans restructuring plans will face a total of 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training emission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers on fighting troops in Iraq would figure out the majority of their re@@ jection : 54 per cent , in contrast , expressed themselves , 35 percent showed themselves .
the other states should have air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive .
however , 24 percent are in the conflict to interven@@ e in the conflict .
in cooperation with Syrian power Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those survey@@ ed would be 20 percent .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence against Serbian Hungarian border
the Hungarian police put on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ n@@ as and the head@@ lights against several hundred displac@@ ed refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ware &apos;s correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the point of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees erup@@ ted the border .
behind the police , a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen was ready for a water @-@ designer .
40 to 50 refugees started to cast stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials subsequently put down the pepper spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much lac@@ ri@@ age was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
thus the Group was dissolved .
the refugees are now re@@ waiting for a while .
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had met with Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried .
other refugees were remaining in themselves and suffered under respir@@ atory .
the cri@@ b of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world is observed if the US staff has come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were question@@ ed by Reuters , was found that the F@@ ed should do this , and now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and will keep interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event since it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest in NULL beha@@ ved to NULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero domain and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , chief employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed can not ignore the less ro@@ unding view of global conditions .
it war@@ ns the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death thro@@ gh@@ ers at the Delta State University left exc@@ use ap@@ ologies
after the kill and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on the day and killing Sh@@ annon stret@@ ch@@ ingly killing him , &quot; he could do it to happen , &quot; gave it to the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and said , He was shot on someone , and someone killed .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency central that police officers were sending polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in@@ quired the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb of 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police killed him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Mind . &quot;
despite reports on Monday the Lamb believed that Pr@@ un@@ iss could also have a relationship with Schmidt on Tuesday , there won &apos;t be any information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss was replaced by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , who said that they were married about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ un@@ iss would have one daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ iss were their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss served online from home , according to the statement of Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss had had a dog named Light@@ ning who met her for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Ko@@ w@@ les
the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday in order to tell them , &quot; he didn &apos;t go into prison . &quot;
when police approached him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , he drove his car to the side , fled on foot , running into the forest and killing himself with a shot .
Lamb obtained a doctorate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University and obtained his CV based on the university &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm

in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ term partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .

all of this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a big group of group sales .
in the year , Lufthansa will only want to save half a billion euros in a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1000 exec@@ u@@ tives will cost the workplace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new negotiations with the pilot project .
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the restructuring is an investment contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and earnings sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline distributed on Wednesday .
among other things , by Lufthansa , there is no more gover@@ ning board for passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings line airline should be designed as an independent as possible .
in the Executive Board , CEO Carsten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings for Euro@@ wings in the future .
with the new publication , Spo@@ hr emphas@@ izes the significance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group will continue to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
under the passage of the Passage Air@@ line Group , the airline operates three @-@ quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resumed after the closed strike on this Thursday .
that shared the union .
the theme of the talks is meant to be a pilot control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and Air@@ line led to various strikes in the past few months .
in addition to the trans@@ itional supply of the pilots the Spar@@ concept &quot; Wings &quot; is in the background .
it appears that Lufthansa will be re@@ located in the fight against competitors for the group at Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
the Champions League Sha@@ w was played at the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven a double fra@@ cture of his right one .
while this brings the left foreign def@@ enders to tears , and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal does not give hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the violation was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w crashed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said , &quot; He has a double B@@ one structure and lies in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow it will be moved to a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s awesome - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United who plays very hard and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen massage .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double question@@ naire , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of a wre@@ ath .
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish Mexico .
van G@@ aal susp@@ ects that the Italian refer@@ ee had ent@@ an@@ gled .
you can judge for yourself , if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et presented to Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I will come back again . &quot;
referring to : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at the PS@@ V
the UK defender with the European Championship in France has an added incen@@ tive to relax until the coming June .
Phillip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury to the place , all are very sad about that .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a cur@@ ry , when Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ as , the Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; it is very difficult because it &apos;s not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard I can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron kept The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron , you might be David Cameron .
when he was asked of a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book decided to call herself the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environment conceived by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it &apos;s always a picture or a message that we missed so far . &quot;
all well and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron stated the action of the book , returns a syn@@ op@@ sis of the movie version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to extend the rather short text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to see his wish to see a true tree , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss host@@ el was ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this wasn &apos;t quite enough : the text of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the web site of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the web site of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is committed to the action of the book as little as the local environment , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing lau@@ rel , falling , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; which is devast@@ ated by the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text may probably come from Cameron &apos;s speech office .
super@@ camps affir@@ med that the text was delivered by Cameron Emplo@@ ye@@ es , but there were no more immediate comment@@ aries .
Adam Ly@@ th was visi@@ bly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult still
to cra@@ ck Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res , the England for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward stage .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks Site is possibly less experienced than the three years ago but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing @-@ list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not wear a fool &apos;s of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even when he represents an unknown size on the test plane , an option for the attack .
this related message : Adam Ly@@ th retired from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
for me , the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is natural for me as his head coach in Yorkshire , difficult to analyze .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and simple but hard reality is that crime players are oriented to results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this to that - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago , you would have extended the run of Ly@@ ons , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully hits further runs for Yorkshire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure as well , even if he did not give up such good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is especially a team man .
the question how much time a test man gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down .
the only repro@@ ach to be up@@ lifted out that England was first mentioned in Jonathan in the Caribbean - but as Ly@@ ons was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a striking man I guess .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yorkshire early in this season when he achieved 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
it must be at least the same chances as those received before him , but of course it depends on the World Team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , wanted to bring an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four j@@ icks off , and I found nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket Players .
Mo@@ een might not be doing his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no major difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as a open@@ er in 2001 .
he instantly got three hundred p@@ uns , and looked not back .
in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is very impressed and impressed me as a young man .
people possibly see his statistics - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup spi@@ ders that lift their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few clever supplements on the train@@ ers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
it is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ch of the game that will bring an abundance of experience , since he has played under all circumstances and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are consistent with that previously .
col@@ lagen team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ maker does not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players hin@@ ge their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ xit Camp ( Bre@@ xit = exit of Britain from the EU ) might gain a load when the economy ends up until 2017 in a F@@ lau@@ te
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ elabor@@ ate re@@ development strategy to hold the UK in the EU , even without the election of the in@@ gen@@ ious Jerem@@ y . &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or Tu@@ c , severely de@@ faced in Europe because of Europe .
foreigners also have their cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ es , saying that some member states , so deeply sho@@ cked in several crises , such as the EU is now , and not always from their own debt , Britain itself has split conc@@ essions and irrit@@ ating changes that they are not willing to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ ghton , Tu@@ c decided on its annual meeting that it may not like it if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local dimensions , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who looks outside the Great Britain within the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; says it not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can look through more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials in some main towns till the point , in which it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she wants to leave the office for 10 years before it looks bad for her , as it looks badly with the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated long endurance race such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande is looking at his re@@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also an abandoned power .
Poland would soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will be able to pull a leg to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies have .
therefore some such ministers may not deliber@@ ately plan helpful comments , all in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; the new trial was a ple@@ dge &quot; and &quot; United Kingdom has won &apos;t won any value from the new trial . &quot;
the Europeans know how to be r@@ ying the Fle@@ et Street on their costs and which EU scep@@ tic is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as it was not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired by Tony Ben@@ n with a ratio of 2 : 1 in 1973 .
you can get weak to Boris Johnson , the ore Euro Opp@@ ortun@@ ists , who has made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ry ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .

actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but noted that when one sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , it is better distributed to di@@ stract him instead of becoming a lunch and dinner .
in fact , mil@@ iti@@ ans was opposed to Bl@@ air as Bl@@ air himself , as he opposed the speech against the referendum , which was rejected by French and Dutch v@@ oters in 2005 , which was then opened by French and Dutch v@@ oters in 2005 .

it re@@ minded me of the 70 &apos;s years when his old father himself became engaged in tel@@ ev@@ ised to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going to go far and lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was still more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell told , still what J@@ C told his com@@ rades and dep@@ u@@ ties with all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the feel of the bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n , you will remember that he even has touched me - news discipline will remain important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ end@@ campaign for a self @-@ intel@@ li@@ iti@@ vity , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns is fundamental to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite siege industry , its anti @-@ capitalist history - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left dis@@ si@@ dents that is a central principle of dog@@ matic protection .
as with its majority of members in Nato , Tom Watson is convinced that J@@ C will not start any campaign for ex@@ iting - are foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find , in all a sense to find their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn away political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious v@@ oters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the United States are already pretty disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction by the T@@ ory government which was re@@ minded on Monday of something that was called by British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
statement on a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes have been less harmful as smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts that write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) signed Lanc@@ et by critic@@ izing the evidence of e @-@ cigarettes used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Financial Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have asked the power rating of the data and refer to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the exhibition magazine Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily tiny basis , &quot; on which P@@ he founded his main conclusion .
two more researchers write to BM@@ J and asked whether the claim will build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based upon proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes should be about 95 % less harmful than smoking in a detailed review of reference and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ critical evaluation analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to implement their opinions about the damages of different nic@@ otine addic@@ tive products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting , a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , was to have been managing director of British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also submitted the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainable Development Report .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive means of an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing which he should have received after reported by the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added to them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide industrial financing in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
the research work of the group &apos; conf@@ essed &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most of the products , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well@@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has been re@@ acted to the claims .
he said : &quot; e cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes have been low compared to it , but that we still have to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to view the public about what is proof , and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to the tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die each year on a disease with smoking , smoking and smoking costs € 2 billion a year .
by clear forward of current evidence that e cigarettes is not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ l@@ ders , former chief of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should send the programs such as East@@ l@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arms &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK @-@ broadcast@@ ers .
it critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from transmit@@ ters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations said Johnson that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on behalf , or send it clearly from un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of BBC .
if you do not want to keep the broadcast fees , what I think in medium or long term is not supposed to do his production , at least on programs that do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve a wide broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ culous , of course , non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ l@@ der is another one , ad@@ mit@@ tedly both own productions .
hon@@ estly other channels would give their right arm for this .
I am trying to see how it should be public @-@ public TV .
I do not believe this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence on the hunt is &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of the people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give back what the former Director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC will sell such as East@@ l@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where they can &apos;t see quite the general public , but they can argue that they are created on their seem@@ ingly holy missions , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
on the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value .
of course , think all of you think that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is £ 150 for a lot of money , ask me whether this is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ der , who also test@@ ified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check out their char@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio . and they should take an example on public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot; inform , clari@@ fy and maintain . &quot;
on the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of TV shows us to make use of commercial verb@@ al alli@@ ances to make everything online available .
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which it radi@@ ates with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified thr@@ illers , which can be controlled by bre@@ ads of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they have sound impul@@ ses which have too high frequencies for the human ear to become heard .
the impul@@ ses work by switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to bear the membrane can@@ als that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics which can be used for ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells out of the body .
Srebrenica &apos;s Srebrenica , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , CA , said the Guardian that the trial of one day could replace the down@@ stream @-@ brain stimulation method , an inv@@ it@@ est method , which det@@ ects electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ worth@@ ily are not acting on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani placed it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 on@@ c@@ ite channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves generate the opening of these I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ channels and activate the cells that they are assigned , thus a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ ions TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry .
when he turns on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ ions .
the method has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows researchers to switch and switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the required spot in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves may occur un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent so into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight Golden Rules for Life in Stud@@ ents
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the an@@ gled sm@@ iles who I have upset - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the residence in student homes ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking up to an absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to z@@ apping : people tell where you &apos;ve got where you come to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you don &apos;t love to hate them , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract , ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , with whom you would not talk , even if your eyelashes do not respond to fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers could be .
allow people to be saved .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages @-@ form@@ ulations , film night venues and municipal matches , but they are also the places where people attract and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to : remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to li@@ fel@@ ong friendship .
it can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continued , but you must go away that I have consumed the energy that I have consumed with you for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a coma is exhausted from speed - and send it a SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
ap@@ rop@@ os Ank@@ lo@@ ci@@ der : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with baking .
as you start the Uni at the back of Back Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the back of the back @-@ mania is to present itself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I gave you a little upset . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mate feel obliged to enter@@ tain himself and will be associated with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat do some people to sleep in when you need purchase .
ste@@ aling is a natural crime in students residence .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the mil@@ kbar .
the chances are good that they say to use yourself , even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to cope with it as my room@@ mate , who added an ins@@ ul@@ ant to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they shouldn &apos;t make any noise , the people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about to be a decent man , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the saying among men who sit in the greenhouse .
a girl on my corridor asked their neigh@@ bors if it seemed to give them something qui@@ eter , drum &amp; bass got something qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a trial on the morning .
they acted with even more lau@@ er music .
when she finally ceased at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours again for two hours before she pulled her own music , shut up her door and went to her dre@@ aded test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic , if your future wife would stay into the same student residence ?
it would be the opposite way , if you keep a resident for your future partner , to separate themselves and take it again every day and might be able to see how they all collabor@@ ated with friends ?
of course , the heart goes on his own path - but when a hot co @-@ resident is definitely not your future partner partnership , try to talk at least to talk a little bit of reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has its key in its un@@ locked room is the border between an Ul@@ k and mob@@ bing f@@ einer as it seems .
a good route is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
soli@@ di@@ fy yourself by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but you never ship any room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and shampoo .
seal their door , and put their keys in a glass of water , which you will then put in the freezer , but drives their poss@@ essions on the ceiling more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , single @-@ time extrac@@ tors ,
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the middle @-@ Frank@@ ish ver@@ ter@@ raced houses for people who did not have much money .
thus , for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential home , but also the mothers and the Ger@@ ing@@ exp@@ orter . &quot;
&quot; I can view how you can build and well @-@ build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old at an interview
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly cheaper housing can be created : he builds in a project ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain in a great part here .
due to the refugee flow we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a quite ordinary , three @-@ storey building is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a ter@@ raced house needs the least space .
it makes the integration easier .
that is different , if one puts people into bar@@ bells .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees arrive , there is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
seal : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is equivalent to 184 000 Euro , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is adequate .
do the construction regulations have complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have correctly set up my project correctly .
always complicated , it always makes the threat@@ ening Dam@@ oc@@ tr@@ ash Exten@@ sions Special and the Ac@@ com@@ plac@@ ental Order .
cre@@ ep@@ y ig .
it is still under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities l@@ acks the place .
and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents respond to your ter@@ haus project ?
g@@ ild@@ ing : there were those who have thrown me to create luxury houses for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not right .
but do not shar@@ pen@@ ed your competitors for affordable housing ?
g@@ ild@@ ing : true though , in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but we were built of luxury apartments which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , including normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mothers @-@ extrac@@ tive mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ exp@@ orter .
I will show how one can still build and well @-@ build today .
this is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by selecting the app , to &quot; General &quot; type , and then choose &quot; software update . &quot;
if there is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it .
some are encounter@@ ed after installation on problems , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
in order to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to have either to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ etion of apps to create space , but Apple has made it easier to do so . just as it is easier to do this , if you use a special tool , install apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete .
it pays to ensure your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charging unit , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple cannot be said that the update will continue , as the phone may switch on half way and may lead to a termination of the updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes practice Fel@@ den@@ ausen and invested 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen .
furthermore , Bernd Bor@@ mann , mayor of U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also delighted .
in many places on the country , doctors - As@@ endorf are lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ den@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen goes to retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich passes his successor in the coming months still with half a position on the side .
following a conversion phase , Müller opens practice on October 12 again until then he invests 3@@ 10000 euros in rooms at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at the first glance if Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently taking their salary in a dener hospital , and she plans to go into practice as well .
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was so far , I was just calling it . &quot;
the couple of Müller pleased the idea to operate its own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patient are very attractive for us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also see his own boss .
and so one was embar@@ rass@@ ed , the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
they will continue to stay in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .

from 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
throughout the surgeon , Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ den@@ ausen has been working as a family physician , his wife speci@@ alizes in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the land@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a house .
&quot; the final os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examination as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ GS and need a room room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a total amount of 500@@ 00 Euro will receive the garbage cans in the framework of a German county programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and from the municipality of Zambia ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice continues , &quot; emphas@@ izes Sam@@ pler &apos;s Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann .
in approximately 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l each quarter comes into practice Fel@@ den@@ ausen in the North German aver@@ n@@ xis it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another home practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor has found , it would have gone too .
he who has visited Müll@@ ner &apos;s office , will continue to look at their faces : the seven medical experts appointed and the cleaning forces of rock formations .
with their departure end in As@@ endorf it ends an era , after all , medical doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we only had two rooms , &quot; refers to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ gh@@ ausen .
a bit of per@@ tin@@ ent have already scattered them after the long time .
&quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly see a lot more often , &quot; says Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in .
your husband will be supple@@ mented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter space . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pushed me before gar@@ dening , so now that could be different . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are done at our border south@@ ward , &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
checks on the Hungarian border are kept parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and security of the people is in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear , however , &quot; that there are obvious signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people must know that bound@@ less migration flows do not accept , nor about the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel towards Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances , Cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees build .
the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ y Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see it .
&quot; the idea of Kor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the supervision of the border - mainly to Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already very controlled as an outside limit for Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians will not expand its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; each EU member must complete its commit@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government divided the first refugees to Tuesday would have tried to soak in the c@@ roati@@ a c@@ roati@@ a border crossing at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in east , in order to soak for the registration .
the Croatian police found it in the near cor@@ p@@ ments .
according to local media , police vehicles always meet new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is known primarily by Syrian and Afgh@@ an , including numerous women and children .
life services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with approximately 4000 refugees , said Minister for Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would have brought to the Hungarian border from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Hungarian border , which had previously managed to Croatia in Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Serbian government , however , denied that it is to interven@@ e certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor would we do it , &quot; was it .
according to media reports , certainly in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the municipality of S@@ id , during the day more co@@ aches would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers have been travelling all the night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border from Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia and Austria .
this means that in fact , in fact about ob@@ servers already predicted a shift in the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatian Minister of Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ized that his country for the case of a strong au@@ stro@@ us have been preparing special plans for possible shooting situations .
but he did not see details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen board provides comprehensive possibilities to border control . &quot;
they lead rig@@ orous controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of the EU since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently witnessed a good report concerning the standards of border controls .
on this side there are still some 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic still tried to calm Wednesday at a local control certificate : he is now holding the debates of the Alternative refugees , after the Hungarian border is closed .
currently it would not deal with very high refugee numbers .
you can &apos;t tell if she would continue her journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers for migrants to - dangerous @-@ Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute land maps on which alternative routes are recorded by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police declared that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence , this public acting action is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
however , everyone shall say to it publicly , however it is under@@ stand@@ able , ultimately it is a very personal matter .
the topic of death and death is to be used as before with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although straight the Hosp@@ itals in recent years have contributed much to the people open .
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ends is shared .
the death and tragedy is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
by being confronted with the theme , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in die efforts .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ itals was visited by appeal , she reported immediately and had been involved with the foundation in the year 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ame belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the interested and depend@@ ents in private homes , nur@@ sing homes , nur@@ sing homes and in hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent .
they all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ends can do well with their purpose and experience gained experience and experience .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ te , consider it for precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says .
the offer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ itals is free of charge and dep@@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sun@@ sets .
financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and clubs enables the training as well as trainings and super@@ structures of the die and tragedy .
all two years are offered training for new employees .
the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited at the House of the Evangelical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes can also be listed there .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant received his winning view of a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to adjust 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening ceremony on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told you to earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cent less than the previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower level of view comes in spite of the price increases , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite a higher supplements for body transport of heavy and large packages that will be collected starting from November .
the company said , however , that the result was increasing due to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves solid yields , considering the expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade .
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the R@@ ival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million sold $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research cons@@ ulted anal@@ ysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of the c@@ acks were expecting anal@@ ysts expected to $ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority order , which made sales in its unit Express shipping .
the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales of sales volumes fell by 29 percent , but the operative result was basically flat because of higher costs for bigger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stock shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
they closed Tuesday with 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table seated to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade the leader .
there is a wall picture of the United States threat@@ ening on them at an end of the dec@@ lining , two @-@ storey residence .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the US occupation and pricing here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that it is an un@@ written third Mand@@ ate : financial stability .
and this third Mand@@ ate could be the x factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . it is announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to we@@ aned by the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented incen@@ tive by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that they grow solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets are imp@@ lic@@ able to strengthen these vol@@ at@@ ility by the lifting of the Zin@@ c for federal government , and be it only by one @-@ quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and the inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief Econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed will do what is un@@ sure of itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently been inter@@ viewed by Bloom@@ berg have predicted this week .
financial markets are expecting , however , wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , it is because the Commander releases the s@@ lap , because they promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones achieves an average value of 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; she needs to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argue that a rate of interest would calm the financial markets because it would act the in@@ security when the F@@ ed would act .
even before a month the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first little step in a slow deteri@@ oration of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer , that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be needed to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , improvement on the labour market was solid in this year .
the unemployment rate sank to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest since more than seven years , and near the levels that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although the inflation was steadily under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Shepher@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ il@@ ah .
but the financial markets around the world looked together at the end of last month after China had dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell in May by more than 16 % below the highest level as investors saved , that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ les global growth .
the market saw something in this month , the Dow Jones is now almost 10 % below the May high season .
for the F@@ ed representatives the market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation when interest is to increase interest .
&quot; if the events would not have occurred on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , Mr. Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low , on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff .
now he says that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what impacts on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the global economy is not one of the main effects of the F@@ ed , hence they should be technically not included in decision @-@ making .
but in the final aspect the F@@ ed currency authority of the world became the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the former Director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could close their monetary expansion &quot; by himself , dis@@ b@@ anded confusion around the globe .
in a world in which markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly connected by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments at other locations , but also serve with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey lacqu@@ ers , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction to financial market movements that is apparently not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its conduc@@ tor@@ ship by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a notable impact on growth in the US &quot; said lack@@ er .
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
in 2008 , the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place as a serious crisis in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the committee for the interest income of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come near this plain , he said .
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of an interest rate because the markets came out , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think that it should be odd .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany for these days .
to prepare a warm welcome , not without commitment to countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a number of people who support in@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .

Brazil pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy styles
the SP@@ RS is trying to en@@ ligh@@ ten women on this way , how important good diet is during the breast@@ feeding time . it works with the presentation of images of babies that are painted on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnancy and young mothers get to increase their daily calories to increase daily calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change to make mothers .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects it from tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted turn@@ out building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds move step by step forward : the elabor@@ ate construction application has been unanim@@ ously approved without large discussions .
earlier , the Panel at the subject had still decided on an application for a road@@ map &quot; respectively &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; from a valid earthquake plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; went to make permission for a special form for the roof structure .
therefore , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ joining first and roof gar@@ ages &quot; should be erected .
background of planning is the intended use of the umbrella for solar plants : &quot; this means that we got a wonderfully large sou@@ d@@ ach together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the &quot; liberation &quot; there was again in turn around the attic , which should be made from energetic reasons - unlike the earthquake plan - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is clearly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan stip@@ ulated in the roof is no &quot; exceptions &quot; which means that the Bern@@ rie@@ ds Municipal Council usually falls apart with the liberation orders .
at gy@@ ms , there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a prec@@ ed@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gy@@ back building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the expense .
subsi@@ dies are expected from school and lat@@ itude .
in the next proce@@ eding , the construction contract for the 18 x 36 meter will now be submitted to the governor , to the governor .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed as planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Land@@ kreis before , which confirmed Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
however , a decision on the board is the Supervisory Board and the christ@@ ening on Wednesday , September 23 .
should the plans be implemented , all the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital .
the overwhelming majority are sol@@ der with f@@ ishers and the further existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the people who can not be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in We@@ il@@ heim , then Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der who has been the sole operator of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , now changes to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
at the question who will take up the succession , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ white , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play in order to take over the line and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of October 1 , 2014 .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; recovery &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; as Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology services .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board is to ad@@ mit to both houses , until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which still has 35 beds , has finally shut down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the county road was planned to date for 2018 , when the current ongoing renovation was completed at the We@@ il@@ heim hospital .
governor of Jo@@ chner @-@ white , which is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors , entered into the house that the house , which is owned by the Federal President , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , I could not tell Jo@@ chner @-@ white , there &apos;s plenty of refle@@ ctions .
there is currently a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a conference psychology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened all over the past decades , and departments became closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ of the Rhein @-@ Neckar Lion are now called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .

Jag@@ ni@@ kes with two hits in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tra@@ ders were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the cor@@ n@@ ition on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police officers .
after a donation a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injury and were brought to hospitals .
just as it could happen to the accident , first of all was un@@ clear .
the det@@ ective police was determined .

a crime @-@ susp@@ ect led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se who merged 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the absence of the 20 year old , the 20 year old was killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses were thrown into a channel in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pfalz has been a victim of violent crimes .
the cor@@ p@@ se of young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police arrested on Wednesday .
also , on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old campa@@ ig@@ ger , who actually conf@@ essed his statement and introduced the investig@@ ator to the discovery of the body .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing
the location of the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun .
with upcoming refugees and unemployed workers from the EU , more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with income citizens over the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built until 2020 .
the result is a study on behalf of the &quot; Social housing building . &quot;
for comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
to the present 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay , to live asylum seek@@ ers in a first recording accommodation .
many then come to the apartment market and cat@@ ches up into the long queu@@ es in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Statist@@ ical Office the last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were occupied .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only in the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant contracts in the housing policy of the past few years .
Germany ti@@ ghten a residential deficit that is bigger from year to year .
currently , about 77@@ 0.000 inhabitants currently missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , the author of the study .
because of working people , many professionals lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed no longer on the apartment market for no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the cities , the number of square metres per capita has declined in the past years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new incen@@ tives are to stim@@ ulate the social housing structure .
thus the government tax could be cancel@@ ed and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments could be exposed .
in addition , according to the Alliance attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options are necessary .
the support program for Refu@@ ge@@ es at the State Bank Kf@@ W is already doing well in cities and communities .
a good week after the start on Monday evening at 184 million euros , more than half of them have been logged by some 300 million euros .
now the project might be enlarged .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia corridor a corridor
Hungary is practically no longer a penet@@ rating , as more refugees select the way over Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to the north without a hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia beyond the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian @-@ Minister and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already a member of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the arrival of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television broadcast@@ ers RTL .
Hungary had broken his border for refugees on day before .
new laws , which occurred on the same day , make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic said : &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border with Serbia in the morning .
according to media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan consist .
they came with the bus as well as tax@@ en in the Serbian border city of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia .
although the Croatian @-@ Serbian border failed to cross the refugees .
for this the border stri@@ pe of other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border barely any more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday , the police stopped working for 366 days .
shortly before go@@ z@@ ure on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws pro@@ vision@@ ing the over@@ coming and damage of the border with us as an off@@ ence .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted prisoners of arrest issued up to five years and dep@@ ortation from the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Authority on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum claims were carried out on Tuesday , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , some 40 refugees were stopped .
practically , no one has got any more view to gain asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers should be put down there .
only a few hundred refugees were gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started to clean up .
they collected the tr@@ ash , ten thousands of people left the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
the shut@@ ters were dismant@@ led and one of the capture camp in the boundary was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the purpose of this conversion .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive .
moreover , the country has increased its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country .
about 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the further driving to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing two groups of refugees met regularly for smaller groups .
Mayor drove &quot; St@@ ary &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go with the train to Passau .
because Germany was surprisingly , because of the refugee flow from Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and got along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the near of Passau .
before we were once again spoiled for guests , with cause and drink .
we said the same , we drive them by car to Passau .
&quot; it was obvious for us , &quot; as Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that surprised us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the conf@@ essions were moved on Sunday evening in Wels from a regional train station in a regional train direction Passau , that the train traffic was set to Germany after the short notice , but still to try on the border .
but the regional train was shut off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high on course .
the bridge association celebrated with the Bavarian neigh@@ bors on Sunday , the day before a two @-@ ro@@ omed cross - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
for Viktor Or@@ b@@ án send another Z@@ ig@@ ma to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately with the erection of structures , our Federal Chancellor has officially ruled the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Soci@@ alism .
bodies of such policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the boundary areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
the poultry will also have to find that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land , &quot; which she invited and welcome , is nothing but a refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge , in view of the continued refugees and the coming winter , to provide decent com@@ ings for protective seek@@ ers .
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria maintain .
Konrad at the Search for 35@@ ,000 win@@ em@@ akers
Konrad has all hands to do with refugees .
Christian Konrad has lived there that his word has weight .
the government used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to impos@@ e lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos within the first takeover of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received a grip on .
&quot; we have no more hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry was speaking of a &quot; dirty situation . &quot;
together , Konrad has a total of 85@@ ,000 st@@ aff@@ s in the he@@ ur@@ ous year .
to meet the number , more 35@@ ,000 accommodations are to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 shall prepare the countries , 15,000 of the wa@@ ist@@ band .
should we become more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; said Konrad .
he has had talks with the country leader .
they would have assured him to provide even for the coming refugees escape .
&quot; he is doing well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Man@@ atar is supported by Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations of the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also put into the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ping as &quot; we . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , it is hop@@ ed for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that Lo@@ dg@@ os@@ ors have to hold a certain amount of towel holder or size of cav@@ ities .
&quot; emergency standards would have to apply to a temporary time .
by contrast to the Interior Ministry , the accomodation is successful , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who is not talking without any other face in the face .
belief force is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er will not cause the republic to accept as they themselves explained .
their number of employees will increase to three to four .
the own community for lod@@ gings still hasn &apos;t been successful yet .
Conrad wanted to place a container at step@@ han@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with approval .
Linz calls for a better division
only the opening of the municipal sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary , since people are able to carry out these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of emergency , however , further sites are to be checked upon their capability .
criticism of the Municip@@ ality is taking part in the division of refugees within the Bundes@@ land .
other districts too have to pay their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not bri@@ ghtened ! &quot;
in a longer telephone conference with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) adopted a further preliminary request on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the deliveries of refugees in the Federal Republic shall continue to be possible .
however , it will give the necessary limit controls .
there will be no more special benefits with refugees to Germany .
however , the seek@@ ers would have moved with regular trains to Germany .
by the other EU Member States , P@@ ü@@ ehr@@ inger once asked more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial bar is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) , is supposed to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the Technology business .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T he chief Hannes Low .
he can imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard , and later also to be acquired .
from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with new neighbours - from which low @-@ house amount promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
from S &amp; T , 1.7 million euros have been invested in the plant , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which will be one third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been used for 60 years from Linz AG to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
around 30 per cent of the 2700 square metre living area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it requests .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are located in the centre .
actually Jutta &apos;s wanted to put a dog .
this project had to de@@ pri@@ ve the 49 year old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ro market arcade : finally , it has now gained momentum in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything is about to have ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , Wall@@ ets starting from 75 Euro .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among others that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of its own site , to which only their hand@@ bags were sold , attached .
&quot; we are the only ones in the greater area of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots .
your fashion interest has given wide from her mother to cra@@ dle .
most import@@ antly , if something is developing and I can show new trends at reasonable prices .
why so some woman while looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in ec@@ stasy , the woman cannot be answered with the last safety .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag is val@@ or@@ ized every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a village whose inhabitants are inv@@ ading .
this property also links to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for you .
whether he expresses foreign host@@ ile , journalists touching or having to be manif@@ ested in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ y the election campaign vig@@ or@@ ously .
and cuts well over .
this will also be registered in the cru@@ el@@ ic town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents date back to the property .
the New Yorker at the F@@ öh@@ n@@ f@@ ris@@ ur is a concept of many in the wine region at the wine road .
man@@ holes in the 1200 inhabitants site is related to over -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del shot a film about Tr@@ ump .
what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , to become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow finds it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by their own type , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary on the place and his famous spro@@ uts , among which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement he certainly would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend the mind that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
acci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in a circum@@ ference , said &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - the An@@ gi@@ ver , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather was immig@@ rated and opened in the USA a local man for gold dig@@ gers .
corner@@ stone of the property company was first property purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : her wish , to return to home to home , failed by the Bavarian state to which the Pfalz belonged to at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once was without hom@@ ologation , had the Director of the Institute of Sp@@ äl@@ z@@ ic History and Folk Dan@@ ces , Roland Paul , for film start .
&quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the among the distinctive statements of the after@@ market .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and required the construction of a wall wall to put off illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a far relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the vin@@ t@@ ner in retirement sees the Americans more dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; he is always so young . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension econom@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as some like K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family moved to a visit to the church organ , which came in general .
&quot; it can &apos;t be imag@@ ined by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they find it better when he does not make the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
if those who had the days of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics like him , &quot; said Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as a president ?
&apos;@@ my president is not &quot; it , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els movie , who was inter@@ viewed for the tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 cinema receivers , even in the US guards the interest .
the Upper Bavaria Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
from the president of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of the national park in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden was awarded the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain cli@@ mates . &quot;
in neighbouring country , the Alpine Association is responsible for the award of the award .
a mountain hiking village &quot; is allowed to have a maximum of 2500 people .
at least one @-@ fifth of its area must be designated as a protective area .
Seven &apos;s sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , sei@@ ze the loss of leadership in Today &apos;s show
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson &apos;s rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report to the loss of leadership in the liber@@ als , but there has been no big shifts in the reviews for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ around hit the crash of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the R@@ ival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side to Australian TV spectators seemed to play a role for Australian TV spectators when sunrise showed an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main towns , compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today we closed the gap to sunrise in the last few months .
in August the average was 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
up to date , sunrise will have an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .
the winds of change include more than the Parliament in the morning !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for review !

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might have un@@ certain apparently who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s , was finally gra@@ ve@@ iled in the biggest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be left if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we came with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on day , before three two are checked , you might have acci@@ dentally given a hint to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have left their ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; could be their answers to the play destro@@ ys who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki they both called fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and realised ( Sar@@ ahs ) and SA@@ MS energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was quite compatible with the whole course , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth at both feet and it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are suitable as a pair .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the domestic visit made her clear that Wood &quot; could be the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this obviously is not only a game - I am now un@@ restra@@ ined on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who wants to be Wood , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally . it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten , Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .

Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the river F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t have any worse starting in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing , which now happens , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .

4 People killed , after police officers were shooting in Nepal on demon@@ strat@@ ors in Nepal
four people , including a 4 year old boy , killed in southern Nepal , after the police , in order to kill the proposed new constitution , a public officer told on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , senior executive officer , said that more than 1,000 protest@@ ers were gathered outside a police station , some of them cast stones and fire@@ bom@@ bed .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police found Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot up in the air before they move on rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the Gum@@ mig@@ uer@@ ote used , of which it is known that they can be killed , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced as high fat@@ ality rate produced .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ ese levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces will be formed under the proposed new constitution , which would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that wants to make a separate state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were employed in violent disputes since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in provinces - an important step toward a new constitution , but a controversial topic in Nepal has been centrally ruled by centuries .
since 2008 , the work on a new constitution has been on the way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the trial after the devast@@ ating earthquake that thousands of people had killed in April .
the legisl@@ ature has voted for this week in the constitutional design in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

they are waiting for related services , called it from the city .
which investor is in@@ quire , isn &apos;t yet clear .

project H@@ ie@@ ve : details are on the table
the planning to holiday houses at the Little Sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor was introduced for the first time public plans for the project .
several anim@@ ators are more troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge
for months , over the closed doors , gre@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday in the little sea are near Em@@ den at the table .
the Inter@@ est@@ ent , the Central European Em@@ press , &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday night of the Em@@ press Council for the first time .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , Ralf Behr@@ inger went out of the system building management in the offensive , &quot; we did not have any answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Members of the council and more than 50 visitors .
yet it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project has been imp@@ aired by ten to twelve million Euro in the debate since months .
major responses under Meer@@ bus@@ hes , which had come to the meeting , called up the images and new details of the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , the owner and board member of the executive board of An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z , over@@ looks the other building . &quot;
in addition , he fears how many other project leaders fears that traffic would increase strongly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; as whole Bus@@ lad@@ der@@ ies are coming , so that it says , &quot; says Schulz
what happens to the well @-@ known area of the old inn , though , is still open .
nor is there any operator .
&quot; first we need to have a conclu@@ sive idea , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ inger .

Google starts dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( Goo@@ fy . O ) announced a double donation from a campaign that will aid 11 million $ for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have rolled out the European nations from war torn and poor countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
rather than a manager wanted to make the announcement , Rita mas@@ oud wrote a Google @-@ employee who had fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old , about her personal experience .
&quot; in our journey many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants are growing in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations raised up to a value of 5,5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com , called to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has exp@@ elled more than 4 million people this year .

for easily overweight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of loss loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new trial .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after the loss of loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; die mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss of loss or obes@@ ity , use several methods to shr@@ ink the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years O@@ bes@@ ity has proved over the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies were conducted among people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers from Tai@@ v@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and stomach cancer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI , under which this operation under@@ went , decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI remained in those who did not receive surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ undergo surgery surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , however , diabetes in comparison with diabetes was dissolved just in one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
moreover , the results were carried out in the control of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; in general in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also super@@ vised the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held at 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level , did not decrease the mortality in five years , as the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also conf@@ uses average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , major reg@@ ression increased in the BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier men in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , a group of obes@@ ity was subjected to a group of obes@@ ity about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that was conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for people with a BMI less than 35 that are interested in the process .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because they say that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors begin to take weight serious , once the patient is with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we have too long to wait until we bring people serious , &quot; she said .
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , that have firmly connected her body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ s@@ rück
it is a theme that is currently focused in fiction and este@@ em for years : a young woman , at school times incur@@ ably and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets after years the flock of her youth again , and this fell in love with them .
so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
in addition , the novel is unlikely to be interesting for Hun@@ s@@ amm@@ ers reader , because he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding villages .
the German author grew up in Lang@@ we@@ iler and is pleased that she could set a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everybody to come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader also urged to stop violence in the refugees of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he called that in the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the Western European countries ad@@ mired still to the refugee crisis , but the situation may not be adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama declared Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in its countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also comment@@ ated George Bus@@ es action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and issued that the violent response to the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four times increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
Georgia Po@@ ison Centre will report a nearly 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , the highly alcoholic bare disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the le@@ thal control centers report , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more frequent in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in record , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children are disinf@@ ect@@ ant inten@@ tionally drunk while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or for a mut@@ ation among the social media .
videos on YouTube show how you@@ ths of disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of a cheap thr@@ ill .
you@@ ths have a disinf@@ ect@@ ant mixed with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be s@@ worn by attractive flavors of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the cat@@ chy ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
there is disinf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berry , wine grapes and orange du@@ ft , which are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant included somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with infants can already perform a few sy@@ ring@@ es to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; reported Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gif@@ t@@ not@@ ing Centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 University in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky spread around but people leave these hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come on it then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es by stra@@ w@@ berry du@@ f@@ ist disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was taken into a emergency room for treatment .
their blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is deemed to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ chie , who treated her at the G@@ tiny Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laughed through her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors en@@ o@@ vers@@ ed them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital to signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl fell by the alcohol and had pulled down her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Or@@ ly Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use soft @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant to be used outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of wall disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities suspected that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three pupils from the fourth class in the State of New York , their &quot; common &quot; teacher was pois@@ oning &quot; by having anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; he reports to be a police report .
the teacher is highly allergy to disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police regarded the sealed plan as &quot; S@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and had inter@@ disciplinary action to the school authority .

de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights from the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things , v@@ ow de@@ cks .
Ron@@ ny De@@ ila accepted that Celtic people must fight , but the Norwegian boss ceas@@ es to deal with things .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ iting from the Champions League , the defeat of 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , which now stands with five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
De@@ ila said : &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now , we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly like this - but we must continue .
we really need the support of Celtic , because the players do better .
to come together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton c@@ auti@@ ously with January @-@ Transfers
in spite of his comments just a few weeks ago , Rang@@ ers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is c@@ auti@@ ous with the signing of new arrivals and persist@@ ed that he wants to inter@@ fere with unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ ence .
the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer @-@ window . &quot;
players who come in the summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate into what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes , more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the add what you really need .

the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn , Edinburgh , in the area of Edinburgh Der@@ by in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , &quot; said : &quot; it is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;

Mc@@ In@@ nes glad to win against Hamilton &quot; un@@ beautiful . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ In@@ nes dre@@ amt that his crew in Aber@@ de@@ en had to fight for a seventh consecutive league victory that had an advantage of five points in front of Celtic on the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July in 16@@ 4.000 , while the number of people work without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the 5.5 % , as the figures for the National Statistics Act ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 per cent , a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish Labour market with an increase in employment and a decline of unemployment .
frau@@ dul@@ ent dis@@ rup@@ tive the exp@@ iry of the process
as security personnel did not satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .

why I will be a witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not occur , I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first found in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day moved closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications than places available , finding a mak@@ eover lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is selected will observe it to be emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit back next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship in the course of months with phone and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the Pr@@ ison agencies say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a notebook and a pin in order to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of a prisoner , as he will , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she pointed out , &quot; she could have something better , &quot; but she always thinks that it is false , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I write to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter is present to write there .
when he dies , it thinks that the public relations work of the Movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ mann , a re@@ trial of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is seated beside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Podcasts that I did .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassin@@ ation of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to act .
but I believe that a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence to just@@ ify a death row .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die .
I can not claim really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters who you can apply for it .
what you get from me is what it is said to see a man without death .
man for wet police pursu@@ ing hunt , come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he was over@@ riding the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Perth , by hanging the police , was un@@ successful when he was in the sil@@ ky and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters from a police officers who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a fri@@ day incident in Bec@@ ken@@ ham on Tuesday .
when she discovered the susp@@ ects he tried to escape to the C@@ anning River in the direction of C@@ anning river .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he got in the water and said &apos; I do not come out , come and get me , &quot; he said , Senior Citi@@ ant , S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make its uniform , so he turned into a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good co@@ p is negoti@@ ated . &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy rep@@ uted that ste@@ wards tried to pause him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from racing Victoria tries to install a spy in his st@@ ables and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he focused on ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they led a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went about the positive cob@@ alt t@@ up@@ fer@@ ment at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of sp@@ ying on the esp@@ ion@@ age , and did not want it to &quot; see how much hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know they wi@@ ped .
sometimes they re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home today and well .
I &apos;d like to walk around the head , and I would like my owners to think my best for them .
when they start to think I do not , then I should not be a trainer .
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had shot the bomb during an interview with rac@@ ing.com , so that the Integration Division had been trying to run his barn .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - which I will name - and offered a job in my st@@ ables , to give information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if this is the case , they should surely deal with their n@@ oses , because they are trying to deal with me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the Route L , David Moo@@ dy , CEO of RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I bring this to the view that it is personal personally ?
the Route L has a scar@@ ce behaviour and perhaps people are responsible for what is going on outside of train@@ ers in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think it &apos;s out there , that I am .
maybe you have to take my license and rep@@ ul@@ ze me , and I have no doubt that what I say they think about it now .
but I arrived now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and press them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the Train@@ ers have built up with the long lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching carried out that he could disc@@ ard his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation by the un@@ eliminated Mei@@ t Black C@@ avi@@ ar , gave the racing treatment rule &quot; ri@@ di@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay has been applied to the horse .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to take over responsibility for this , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff has lost s@@ mu@@ gs on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been all day yesterday , which was also that way .
but it had so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules will know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all want to see that we need rules , but here it is too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
man arrested for drivers ...

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy beat down anti @-@ ri@@ vals for tor@@ ches to ring battle
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy draws criticism of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites to the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told you that the Ar@@ bit@@ ters have allowed the Storm &quot; Ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett has a hard covered note about the Storm team , after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample sequence &quot; of the Rug@@ by League , saying that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ends the T@@ ack@@ li@@ oz of his crew and said that she only focuses on her &quot; contact &quot; at T@@ ack@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team felt confident that they were worried about to be beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; it dives all over again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ combat as she spoke to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed the whole year nothing at our def@@ ensive system or the techniques . however , in the last six weeks we made our contact at T@@ ack@@ les a real focus , and that has provided for us the trend sol@@ st@@ ice .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not getting used to lose so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny as this always emerges again at this time of season .
Bell@@ aria has attacked her idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds us of his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ettes St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; te@@ di@@ ous &quot; football .
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that is the ball@@ play that you would like to play when you have this kind of gam@@ ers .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so that they can play as these .
I build greater confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it went around the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the CM Storm against RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS achieved a higher result than the br@@ once game against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and don &apos;t have any points ?
it &apos;s the schem@@ atics for me .
if they mention us , it means that we will still be able to meet them in one phase .
the Storm team is free on this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin next morning service tomorrow .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guaranteed for drug ad@@ age
a man who might have been sentenced to life imprisonment for a life of 40 kil@@ os co@@ ca@@ ine because of his experimental trial , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , has been set free against a damages deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially li@@ vable punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial volume co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer by Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that it was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that could have been in the café out of a harmless reason .
the Jud@@ ge at the High Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the Prosecutor , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as security together to get his release .
&quot; after reading the full explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan .
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him from being released , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was set free against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , a day at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure p@@ id@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
a ped@@ agog@@ ue used the phone of a 11 year old girl to ask images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g accepted the telephone of the girl when she fell asleep in an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a number of incomplete pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl awak@@ ened later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she looked through , found the conf@@ using reports and immediately im@@ pover@@ ished her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five pictures , analyzed then computers , which were found under the address and found &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which searches for searches for backward images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he would do it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the internet . &quot; and then he gave him a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
the At@@ tor@@ ney E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sher@@ iff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction to fri@@ ghten people .
he gave evidence that the searches were done on the computer from him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten a polic@@ eman .
he was asked about his discussions with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and he said , will see pictures of ra@@ pe and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Play@@ station were used to talk with girls who were much younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded not guilty to the charges of Indi@@ c@@ tment charging the incomplete pictures of children on 14 June this year and not to be trial before the Court of trial on 24 March this year .
defence Law@@ yer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g is not in the Register of sexual off@@ ences , as you can argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; is to be found in his exp@@ ulsion .
Sher@@ iff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael , whether the verdict is filed until October to obtain background reports of social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was kept in temporary detention for hear@@ ings in other cases due to hear@@ ings .
he was still taken before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual off@@ enses .

Stuttgart : the for@@ erunner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
Meteor@@ ologists are warning of stor@@ ks in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a low @-@ pressure area on Western Europe we present warm sea air in Stuttgart , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) divided into Stuttgart .
the strong cruci@@ ble is the f@@ ooth@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; that was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the past few days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , from Thursday it is still in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with ar@@ ches of 60 to 90 hour kilometers .

the mass shows &apos; s : every two years the car at the IAA show its novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , the compact vehicles is to be seen particularly well with the compact cars .
at present , cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked : about 28,@@ 1 percent of new regist@@ rations were eliminated in August alone at this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence , 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models are presented in this year between all of the futur@@ istic design cars and luxury cars .
one of the greatest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , who will stand in the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
with this the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel is launching a entry below the biggest competition VW Golf in a view that starts at € 17 650 .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human .
the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ment of the Te@@ gel pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was housed for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of its human dignity , prisoners have basically claim to pay financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this decision adopted by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision adopted on Wednesday .
according to the persons , they can even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the con@@ fin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful in Karlsruhe with its Constitutional Court : he was accommodated in a single cell consisting of around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who is meanwhile on loose feet after his lawyer has been re@@ located to a larger cell .
his liability for liability due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
however , the const@@ itu@@ tions took up the ruling of the chamber of chamber Berlin and presented the case to renewed audit@@ ing .
they see human dignity hurt .
chamber Chamber now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for jur@@ idi@@ cal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation are decisive , be an ob@@ jection , name was it .
otherwise , &quot; an understanding of the legal protection of the personality would be fear . &quot;
the chamber court must now clari@@ fy the amount of compensation .
the const@@ itu@@ tion@@ ists have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they did not agree with damages in April because he was imprisoned in a cell in the nude .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 according to the majority of a cell without separate toilet .
moreover , in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed a decent accommodation in a parallel event in November 2009 , also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court .
in the case of three months , the then K@@ lä@@ ger was re@@ located every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also made head@@ lines in the head@@ lines over the past few weeks .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ sion will rise , even to fight but it should have already been killed because of the attached position .
according to the judi@@ cial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 should go away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the Immig@@ ration of Refu@@ ge@@ es is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to Germany &apos;s federal budget , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take a million refugees .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do it , and we can do it . &quot;
as it comes to Germany , the following overview gives an overview .
according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) are held annually , the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all paid for rent prices : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social co@@ ats out of the rental are out and in order to apply these particularly favorable flats as well .
Minister of Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social deliveries a year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.4 billion per year .
the scientists and the federal administration are involved , that there must also be more tax rul@@ ings for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 percent of the contrac@@ tors can be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany did not ask for their qualification to help them with their entry , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , however , is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the este@@ em of the record company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ illers .
according to the De@@ er@@ hardt in Germany , a political turn@@ around has given us a political turn : from work ban on refugees to recognition of work .
while a work ban on asylum seek@@ ers was reduced from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence of asylum seek@@ ers to asylum seek@@ ers .
in society , too - because of its solid tem@@ p - mostly the view@@ point is made that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster .
the big barrier for access to the labor market is lack of German .
up to date there is still no adequate offer on general and con@@ vocation language courses .
research shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore to be fully integrated in the view of th@@ ron@@ es of the Royal Route .
the Berlin school management has found that only few spotted parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent , &quot; it is only important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ chem@@ y , spokes@@ man for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate department .
nevertheless , to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management page distri@@ butes hand@@ cards in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increases strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity by expl@@ aining more specialized schools .
in the countries , students without German knowledge will be prepared for classes in welcome .
but they are not always taught by hand@@ crafted teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also from teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ on@@ otes from Berlin school administration .
the German student body estimates that around 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
generally no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or imp@@ ati@@ ent study - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its position .
number of Studi@@ ed refugees could be facilit@@ ated to the university .
for refugees with a resident illness or Dul@@ ce won &apos;t receive any services after the asylum seek@@ er , if they start studying .
the latter generally won &apos;t be BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , as it does not fall under the number of passengers .
Ged@@ ul@@ led refugees had to have lived four years in Germany to be eligible to be eligible for BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but these funds must be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and German Student Affairs .
the students should get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will in future play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should be gradually ob@@ s@@ essive to the same rights as they have the churches , and continued to develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religion .
it would also be important to establish a Islamic @-@ welfare association who professionally takes care of new arrivals .
the rights include duties as well .
thus , the representative of Islam must clear and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and give him some control options .
this also includes the read@@ iness to go with religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Muslim Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , ad@@ ored the concern of religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany would have immediately left their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be much more than today a subject of society .
thereby the majority society has to change , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is pushed .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - have been a anti @-@ discrimination plant and a general equality law .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed how to ignore the rac@@ ist motif in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants and st@@ ak@@ eholders are demanding for a long time in the next few years , if the country shall remain peaceful in the next few years , if the country shall remain peaceful and its new citizens shall be able to use their opportunities - for the welfare of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care for so far expected refugees , &quot; says Medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money flows into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to pick up all the d@@ ain@@ ees with the registration health card .
services could later be cancelled later by federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited performance catalogue illustr@@ ate the asylum seek@@ er Act .
otherwise , doctors make the language barriers especially to the doctors .
as far as previously , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are overwhel@@ med over their diseases as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices have to be taken over for interpre@@ ting costs .
but many refugees were also helped with more general public stops in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee children , there is much more un@@ treated disability , and with the young people , it is about HIV @-@ recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance .
with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors explo@@ it their training , but writes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite diar@@ rho@@ ea or tuber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize . &quot; and what makes the cause of trouble as a result of the refugees even a relief in sight .
the Syrians would have developed a highly developed educational system , several refugees were even doctors .
however , if practic@@ ing practice , however , they would have to disc@@ lose their qualification and perhaps disc@@ lose tests .
at least half of the refugees in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the bund@@ ling therapeutic standard ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most suffer from a trau@@ matic stress of stress or depression .
most vulner@@ able are refugee children , declar@@ es Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich proved that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever is ill at a trau@@ matic stress of stress , suff@@ ers from the so called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ovascular and death .
further symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , strong sc@@ ary and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , however , the process usually lasts several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental ill@@ nesses , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ evaluations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege charges for dre@@ aming
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst go back to the traditions of Circus art .
the goal is to educ@@ ate every age group in the spell of intri@@ gu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sers and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in Man@@ ege invites you to dream for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my Circus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior staff .
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto of the current man@@ e@@ gen@@ ial production .
for more than 33 years , the Circus in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
so the gift will delight in the blood .
&quot; we are important to take away the people from their everyday right and bring them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ izes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ per .
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world @-@ city fl@@ air , &quot; explains Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km @-@ long tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the Circus &apos;s programme convinces by talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar@@ ov c@@ lown Family moves the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent film , the Cuban duo wants to easily capture the Cuban .
light@@ ness and mot@@ ility - they identify themselves with these words .
her hum@@ orous art in the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in storm .
apart from through numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with the finger feeling and artic@@ iness .
balance the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ ug@@ ger@@ men fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes Stephan@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
in the attitude of zir@@ cons are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst takes a position as well : &quot; it is not good for our animals , nor does it take us well . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a strike unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes are called lov@@ ingly , will be read by the eyes on the occasion of every desire .
we want to work together with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to get into the recei@@ pts .
so the upper@@ most command is : good for animals .
specially for your Zeb@@ ras Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ h and a Zeb@@ rast@@ inate , the family Pro@@ bst are proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in a he@@ el and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was here , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst told him .
the Zeb@@ ra isn &apos;t ready for the recei@@ pts , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is safe , &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst will show around 17 and 20 o &apos;clock every day from 17 to 20 September .
the programme begins on Sunday at 11 am and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday night day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the pet show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in the parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , African &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread quickly through social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also urged by statements of opposition members that they had been anonymous and warned against Mr Mu@@ gabe for Mr Mu@@ gabe .
in the past month , they had seized him and interrupted him during his speech in the state of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions and politicians have received SMS messages to their cell phones they were afraid to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ ytes &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told repor@@ ters according to Mu@@ gab@@ yte .
it war@@ ns the members of Parliament that the imm@@ unity ends in Parliament and as soon as they leave parliament , parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
chief speaker said that by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP is split up into two listed companies and separate computer and printer @-@ operations from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected high point reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars in the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman , and Chief Executive that shall lead the unity after separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is focused on smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops , who support companies moving to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and will be focused on providing un@@ finished , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; as a company &apos;s declaration .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , to produce electro @-@ equipment and their Palo Alto garage one also called &quot; the native of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring process to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the belief that narrow focused companies perform better performance .
FC ar@@ sen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mate in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb will have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed over Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was in September and if his rehabilitation is progres@@ sing according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario reveals that wild will certainly won at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace of this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere stopped the last season after a separate &apos; an@@ kl@@ es &apos; hurt , and then back to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury has not threatened the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had previously .
this may be true from purely medical terms , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the corresponding risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he played in only 65 of Arsen@@ as 157 b@@ als in the last five playing times .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs have been regist@@ rated most of the situation of injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability of injuries is continued during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a for@@ gery period of time , in which you must strengthen your body and win fight power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening at Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and at Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey were not traveled to Croatia , that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta must start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to give a little sni@@ ff break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although ar@@ sen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing fields with the biggest en@@ rol@@ ment in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 players , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , whereby the stadium was measured in the scale of 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains with his management to lead the club to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked out before ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other side I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship feast : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons with men &apos;s friends
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open , now more des@@ perate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more common in men than women .
in effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ set ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ me@@ ager life ) announced as the year of man to ask the culture to ask the culture to seek aid if they need them .
friendship is the heart of heart in battle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms felt that when the suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; had , his chances on recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends represent the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to make a friendship .
in the age of social media communication , focusing on style on substance , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , li@@ vel@@ ous and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call exact values , money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focusing on the head was placed .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , that sh@@ one by the interaction as friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football , in cozy arm@@ chairs and longing for Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to any case , even if they are often restra@@ ined , to completely explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
the old word , &quot; I &apos;ll get along with it &quot; has tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when you talk about problems . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that come to me in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term sustainability mechanisms .
this presents clearly the little moments of co@@ ats of men .
so much my objective out@@ sider status via the telephone can also help man in moments of desp@@ air , long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you &apos;re looking at this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ arranged back@@ drop , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Mary hits to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Mary celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani to his place against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani , considered Paris Saint @-@ Germain &apos;s Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria found less than four minutes after the start of the Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , which brought the French master onto the way , but afterwards they passed away a number of occasions before they finally raise their lead when Cav@@ ani recorded a head@@ room at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ ei@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris is also needed a strong start against the Swedish master , since they are not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the four @-@ tone campaigns in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics passed chances before the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his own career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to bring our opponents &apos; problems and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , even though I regret , that we don &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
Mom@@ him@@ ovic returned to Paris in one of three changes in the Paris @-@ Team , which was held on the weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was kicked out in the fourth minute by Di Mary .
the Argentin@@ ian wing @-@ stor@@ mer was named as the man who was sur@@ rendered to the next level in Europe when he reached the last month of Manchester United in the last month of Manchester , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ defence , where he graduated from Johan Wil@@ and in a long corner of the network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would win a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in an Play @-@ off left to reach this level , stood at An@@ p@@ iff with nine national players on the field and stayed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle section called a heavy opponent .
but beyond a shot of Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who settled in Kevin Tra@@ cing P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they are little in the attack .
in contrast , PS@@ G himself gave himself sometimes , with some patches and bad sides , not least of Qu@@ him@@ ovic , who was pat@@ ched by no less than five experiments in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani after re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill , when he gave his players into play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , which was turned into a shooting down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the Pill@@ ar ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . at Uruguay , Uruguay has made its six@@ ty seasonal gate , after sp@@ ans had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts in finding that Malm@@ ö got back into play and only a great impression of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the end result before substitute E@@ ze@@ qu@@ ame Lav@@ e@@ zzi achieved a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we played only in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification games do not work out . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the movie
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion about the diversity and said she doesn &apos;t need behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actors Brown , who emphas@@ ised the necessity of alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ised in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the selected re@@ script of the project .
&quot; if we are talking about diversity , then do it with the instr@@ umentation of the film and not in the instr@@ umentation of the show , assured Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , un@@ loaded un@@ belief , and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor fixed by The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production facility Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as she will handle the character of Harmony , &quot; Brown said .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , which is beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on proves that their direction &quot; at the end could be something we could not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the Social Media explo@@ ded on dis@@ approval of Dam@@ ons .
Twitter users , Mr. Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip , so he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - this is SO LI@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 resolutions since his publication .
Dam@@ on comments will come at a time when ra@@ cial representation in the media at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white c@@ ops in 2014 , the Movement of Black lives lost leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and authorities , disc@@ rimin@@ atory practices against colour@@ ing and disc@@ rimin@@ atory practices .
in February the singer Prince did a recording of mot@@ oring during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Al@@ bums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black lives , albums are still on their significance .
more recently , the leaders of the Movement of Black lives have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a H@@ ass group .
&quot; the network Black lives a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently announced that Dam@@ on was found on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he has accepted the invitation or has already hit the Pope , is un@@ clear .

the last task was climbing the climbing rope at a 75 foot cli@@ m@@ bers in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time that he finished the first Ath@@ let , who finished the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock over the profit of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or have had life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money .
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed set himself with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all , didn &apos;t get any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it is the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changes , it will get the excellent count@@ ability .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s doing anything about it .
he is just so happy to have what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad there Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt so felt when they have changed the roles .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ppers from Minnes@@ ota Twin@@ s
November MIN@@ N@@ EA@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tiger .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger stands in the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday against Minnes@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
Twin@@ s spar@@ ed a chance for Ascension within a half @-@ half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F word which was so difficult to gras@@ p over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Po@@ em@@ ing .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner door@@ step and made three sides .
it was only his third successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; Simon said .
it is hard to t@@ oss in bull@@ do@@ zers each game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger by the German Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z when he had four hits on July 6th , when he had four hits .
&quot; he has done the wood well , &quot; said Aus@@ he@@ el .
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better at the bull@@ do@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the deck .
with three ranks in the hin@@ ge at the end of the seventh day , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into play .
centre F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double in the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks att@@ ained a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bass writer Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Link@@ h@@ anders Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy covered a wall , the only man who was confronted with whom he was faced , in front of the designated Roo@@ kie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , the two @-@ run the the right @-@ handed spin on the right .
with a pair of runners and the conclusion @-@ run during the second she dis@@ comfort the third Bas@@ le Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the major league leading for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was a double Play .
after Detroit finished a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth time@@ ings , Wall abol@@ ished a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however the right @-@ handed b@@ ach out S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth tap .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three ranks in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been kn@@ itted before the game from the injury list , after having been more than one month due to a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt glad when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ falls in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ ein handed over a single second to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abol@@ ished his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third az@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , abol@@ ished a further run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to come to the third , which ended the threat .
the tiger &apos;s in the second , a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ ler .
he did not sit well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points on the third inning before he was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
with Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three ranks among six hits and a walk with four stripes outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal San@@ chez was retired due to a breach of the litter school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the po@@ aching list because of a shoulder @-@ torn , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris will be kn@@ itted by the vulner@@ ing@@ list to start the Twin@@ s .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger , since then he was acquired during exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has since the 20th of August because of a gr@@ it in the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and Twin@@ s will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria introduced an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; I believe that there should not be any question about military service options without Germany , &quot; he said .
he designed the European states &quot; collective bar@@ tions . &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany happened .
&quot; now the conflict continues from front of our door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk .
former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international assistance to refugees .
Austria controls in southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced inspec@@ tions to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening on the Austrian TV station ORF , and now no one is returned to Hungary .
also in Germany , no refugees have sent back to Austria .
&quot; no , this has been agreed , &quot; declared it .
according to an agreement , according to which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already given testim@@ oni@@ als between the General Director of Public Safety and Members of Germany .
concrete figures were not called them and reported on talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria in the past few days .
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders and heads a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not so far to agree on a joint approach in the crisis .
the EU interior ministers wants to take a new start to the binding distribution of other 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to stronger the countries during the initial release and distribution of humans .
the Federal Con@@ federation will conduct this together with the Länder , announced at the end of Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with prime minister in the Chancell@@ ery office in Berlin .
hur@@ ting Merkel , the people who ro@@ ar , would like to protect them .
but who doesn &apos;t have a residence perspective , can &apos;t stay in Germany too .
in the turn , this conception was clearly divided into the round .
the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must cope with a &quot; huge force of force . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees have meanwhile been stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 km long border to Serbia at night .
a few hours ahead , the government announced in Budapest , even the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country so@@ unded different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ g to depart from Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new Grenz@@ en@@ aun .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people that had cut the fence .
in Turkey , thousands of migrants participated in the way to the Greek border .

under the ice age of the Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean is mu@@ ster@@ ed .
these include researchers from observ@@ ations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cas@@ sini . &quot;
this is why the moon moves lightly on its rail by the ring pl@@ ets .
this is only small , but too large for a penet@@ rating of the cel@@ est@@ ial body , in a communication of the Corn@@ ell @-@ University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers define their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; technical sheet .
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
thus , &quot; Cas@@ sini &quot; already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es in 2006 on the south pole of Saturn , the water vap@@ or and ice @-@ particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the South pole there was an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers joined at that time .
but the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

according to Munich , the diagnosis is expected to be four weeks forced . &quot;
&quot; this is heavy for us , Rama is a loss of loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about , &quot; says sports director Nec@@ ate Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; picture &quot; newspaper with a view on the possible commitment of a unified professional . &quot;
as a training guest , the Six@@ ties presented a def@@ ensive model first .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already on contract with V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg .

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy sweet@@ ly sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - mainly Sac@@ char@@ ose .
the exotic fruits are healthy anyway : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. mainly contain man@@ gos but plenty of vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat fruit thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
in purchase man@@ gos should not be too soft or to be firm and comfortable .
the shift color alone does not say anything about how ripe fruit is - so you can taste green man@@ goes very tasty .
you should store at room temperature and will be consumed within a few days .
then they are of course delicious or in sweet foods .
there is also a man@@ go , but also sav@@ ory dishes a special touch .
it mel@@ ts the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads , like Ch@@ ico@@ ree and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney adjust@@ s well to fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

on Wednesday and night , the F@@ öh@@ n partly clou@@ ghs with storm strength by the pe@@ an@@ ion valleys .
after F@@ öh@@ ning on Thursday morning we crossed a striking cold front , the strong rain falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of a comprehensive draft area across the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ west exposure .
in the night@@ mare side , the night is breaking through the valleys at night .
in the episode of the F@@ öh@@ n to Thursday morning , the F@@ öh@@ n runs into the small rivers with ar@@ ches from 60 to 100 km / h , and especially in the Ur@@ ern@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can penet@@ rate up to the adjacent middle of the centre , and even organs of up to over 120 km / h can be found in the mountains .

Rome is now a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Place in Rome .
in the presence of Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a well @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill has been bapt@@ ised on the name of the German Reform@@ ers on Wednesday .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the name had been submitted to the community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , was remember@@ ing that the Protest@@ ants live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as minority often only in secret their faith .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) gave himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions should strongly encouraged him to see histor@@ ians in his later fight against Rome .

hammer artist spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus , with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) crown of thorns , is one of the main plants that painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated the Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with magnificent images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has made his own personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of Bi@@ blical stories on paper and screen in 150 mot@@ if@@ s .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and fan@@ ciful forms has given the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what &apos;s not syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : according to the particular topics , this can work quite sin@@ ister .
for three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a sub@@ jec@@ tively artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; Book of all books . &quot;
created are cycles , which dev@@ otes itself to themes such as cross , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ather@@ hood .
he was thus fascinated by several partners : this also applies to the Luther publisher , with its the@@ ological alignment , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and above all , the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , based on painting with the Bible Study , has been dealt with .
he interpre@@ ts the Bible texts from Ot@@ mar Start@@ ed Bible and thus transl@@ ates into current correlation . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded between the original Bible pattern of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who puts his very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul and emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately born in the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; when the education already happened with the cane , Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members .
&quot; I tried to rev@@ ise this , or perhaps to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
his second concern is to help art the art in a fast time again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is marked today from advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always something mystery and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wishes that the viewer can leave in the pictures &quot; ob@@ scene , discover and feel that power they have : &quot; the image is seeking his presence . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post conf@@ and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art . &quot; I like how he can understand life with his paintings . &quot;
old I have not counted to capture the Bible completely , but that is important for him , also myst@@ ical issues .
&quot; this was no close co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here is the images , the text explains only . &quot; create a screen@@ shots of the Bible .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this is an invitation to deep@@ en &quot; his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for mo@@ ans both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility as well .
a part of the original - and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition presented on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have been doing it for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ union . &quot;
&quot; no one can say no one thing , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; it must be interested in every individual interest to get this subject in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B Chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to investig@@ ate the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet there the State Minister for Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; surely the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the soccer could help and wants to help .
but the decisive course must put the policy .
for this reason , the German Football League has wi@@ dened its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA Cup in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some German sur@@ ists support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ bs set a clear indication if they are on the left tri@@ cot of the otherwise usual sponsor logos ( Hermes ) . we will aid &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; we want to make it clear that all these are to help , wherever and as they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ head Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , no one may see it . &quot;
&quot; we can use football @-@ nation@@ ists , no , we must use our beam force , our influence and our possibilities for helping the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly poor , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbols of the League . &quot;
on Friday , the national team of women made 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale to take part in this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ see had started their own projects in their places , be great .
it is so magnificent , that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is live in football .
&quot; this is of great importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will join the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government at the disposal of 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already called up for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP @-@ CEO lose an eye in an eye
chief of staff of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has repor@@ tedly lost the left eye with several reports according to a fall in early July .
during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the US , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , then came up and tow@@ ed into the street - that told us so last week , &quot; cited the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can , however , could follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet in the Board of Directors in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Pl@@ att@@ ner said .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is working with the meeting and is fully operational . &quot;
in October , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to negoti@@ ate the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP since , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP @-@ headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to let him go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again when we are fallen . &quot;

at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback issued by Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group match won the Europa League final .
the national league will be ab@@ sent to the championship leader of the Bundesliga in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can unfortunately not use him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday .
if R@@ EU@@ s will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen the Bv@@ B @-@ Coach said : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel is not only changing its stem eleven in the R@@ EU@@ s position .
so he had a change at the door@@ ke@@ ying position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place from a b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; blessed the football teacher the world champion .
but if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ chel , however , left openly .
with high probability he is also competing in the second game .

Robotics Car : government wants to lead a role in Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany will be the pioneer of the cars of technological pione@@ ers .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which will discuss investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the Edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA in a &quot; new Mobility age . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less st@@ amping , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the topic also with his counter@@ part from the G7 states , who will also come together with representatives from the industry .
the strategy paper from the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ izes the importance of the mobile broad@@ band extension and an excellent rise on digital listening technology .
a test track is currently being created on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
so that the driver &quot; no additional traffic risks &quot; will be br@@ ushed , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions , &quot; and where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot;
thus , Germany is going to deplo@@ y about international reasons that the maximum speed of self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the Federal Government will also apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which now only sees the people as a driver .
in automated driving the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process the data in a matter of seconds .
following a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 .
however , driving vehicles on public roads are not expected to be expected far by 2020 . &quot;
the authors of the study assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to some 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws may lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic authority S@@ ören Bart@@ ol .
but the question of liability in accidents and security of personal data of the driver must be clearly defined .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute in the order of the test procedure DE@@ K@@ RA is believed to have that only eight percent of Germans are believed to prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent mean that in 20 years , 31 per cent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed until 2025 see autonomous cars in the US , with 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on an independent vehicle .
following a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree that control during the entire trip on all roads .
while driving on the motorway , the flowing traffic could imagine 15 percent , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
good everyone V@@ ared would leave the car to the car under no circumstances .

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a closer look
it is a mixture of very large show and a wax @-@ figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins that look human thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of fashion scene - and with that he put men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung &quot; it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his way towards a show of his person .
he had actually been on the other hand , for : &quot; for me , an exhibition was a bit after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station earlier .
&quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hard @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total work unit that was run for much effort to do the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist was committed .
14 tons of material have mer@@ ging the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest@@ iv@@ ity was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gaul@@ tier said .
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers &apos;s old Teddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender fashion design of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in football ) , he attracted to his te@@ ddy B@@ HS and dresses , &quot; Gaul@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
the kidn@@ apping of fashion he later taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked like the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
but I bought it later , of course .
for his first own fashion show , he did not pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to maintain the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ anned tip as fashion niche
in the past , we used to make long st@@ epp@@ ing machines in and around pl@@ ush to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes emerged in great amount for customers that they took on for example to ceilings and she@@ ers .
today , this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of e@@ quest@@ rian seats .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the early hours of Pl@@ at top fashion played a major role , then was pushed through the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects the previous sty@@ list@@ ic periods , an increasing opportunity of order .
whoever serves no niche in the textile branch in Germany is no longer available on the market .
with us they have already made half of all orders .
Mo@@ ck@@ esh Pl@@ auen is one of nine more companies engaged in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ gar &apos;s tip and st@@ icker .
only they may bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales were gone .
there is almost no more private trade , as well as wholesale , wholesale .
our products can hardly reach our customers on this path .
today , the mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost entirely on chains .
furthermore , export flow , current to Russia and the United States .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer authorized by nit@@ ro@@ us in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that we produce ecological and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the University of Hannover Medical School of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ dery and tips .
to oppos@@ e the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is an area between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that have to think especially economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , animated textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ lied the historic wire drawing tip .
the machine stays small cu@@ ffs at some places .
the con@@ gest@@ ion gold master@@ piece Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt were inspired : &quot; before I could not start with the traditional place of something . &quot;
now they use the sn@@ ail tip for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate process , they shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ral itz - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter says .
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers who have lived in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding of their ancestors who want to remember .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the pl@@ on tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; it &apos;s not going to be a re @-@ film , but a kind of continuation which takes 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl .
it &apos;s about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of world economic crisis in England .

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy wider to the world
the economy has to open oneself even wider , to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was on Tuesday of a group to carry out the reform of the reform .
&quot; China should attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business development , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command group for the deep@@ ening of an extensive reform .
to promote new establ@@ ishments and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and offer new place for economic growth , X@@ i said .
leadership Group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativ@@ ist to regul@@ ate the market access , Rel@@ ax@@ ation of the border controls policy , promoting the public enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the Res@@ et System .
after a statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies identified , which will not apply to investment in question .
system is gradually tested and tested by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance since it as@@ signs the market a greater role in allocation of resources , a legally national business environment , and open the market open , said the statement .
the government will also rela@@ unch the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business .
the statement also said that China is allowed to cross border areas , new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
as part of a offer , state @-@ controlled sectors open , other areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; the government will not change their policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitim@@ ate interests of foreign financial companies and bring better services to them , &quot; said the statement .
moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; to facilitate the requirements and the application process will be made easier .
the law of lawyers to ensure their activities , and to deplo@@ y professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed in a session .

EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limit in smoke fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large volumes and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is present on the EU &apos;s consumer paper , critic@@ ized the plans for industrial and health effects related to pregnant and inf@@ ant effects , with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt von F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have raised the limits of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are so strongly charged with mer@@ cury in fact that at the still applicable limit values , approximately 50 percent of the length may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
in return , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , EU hopes to amount to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ d@@ fish , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is one for the people highly po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal that extends over the food chain particularly in cat@@ fish .
therefore , the Federal Government declar@@ es that &quot; low quantities are particularly likely to cause harm to the nervous system .
the Federal Ministry of Environment is explained on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard &quot; of the general population is &quot; not expected .
Mercury is mainly found in coal combustion to the environment .
according to a written consent of the Federal Ministry of coal , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ k ordered more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nation@@ wide . &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had been cited in March from paper .
last year , war@@ nings about mer@@ cury in fish had already been awarded for the most common health risks in the EU warning system .
