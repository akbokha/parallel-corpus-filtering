8 conversion values , show that Donald Tr@@ ump seriously is seriously .
some have tried to be a flop as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ub@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper R@@ s to go down , it has not been working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the two @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask seriously , what it means for the chances of the nom@@ ination of property Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
none claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts , that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was submitted to the rising Herman Cain , of which nobody won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but external lateral groups like Je@@ b Bus Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps , and begin to make their dollar flow to overthrow him .
here are some current conversion values that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps are rot@@ ated by 180 degrees around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump gave his candidate in mid @-@ June , showed a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University , that only two of ten Republi@@ kan@@ ers were positive .
until mid @-@ July there were 40 percent .
in early August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ kan@@ ers have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten they say that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers hold in early countries .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 per cent of Rep@@ ub@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P v@@ oters GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ub@@ ans , they would be either &quot; impressed &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , which would be the same above tr@@ ump ) .
next to enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters that they would be un@@ happy , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ub@@ ans looks not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump was critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ ular and bel@@ di@@ ous statements , we believe 52 percent of the Republi@@ kan@@ ers , the real temperature for a President , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first advance state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of Rep@@ ub@@ ans think that he has the personality for a upper part , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , we think 44 percent that he does not have the personality to perform effectively , and almost six of 10 ounces , that his temper@@ ament does not appear in the White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters get used to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ ars , rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ ump v@@ ump for real .
if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the last week four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four from ten end of July their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclos@@ ure : GO@@ P v@@ oters had not the most clear cryst@@ all@@ ets in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten Republi@@ kan@@ ers that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , that a multitude of GO@@ P v@@ oters tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ub@@ ans gathered to another candidates , Tr@@ ump proposes almost every day .
some experts indicate that the frag@@ ile field probably are likely to be distributed during the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidates diff@@ us .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ thetic head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump the multilingual support .
in front of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points lead to Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ i and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eurs with 19 points in a hypo@@ thetic head @-@ head race .
a bit majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the v@@ oters , the tr@@ ump will say that they have forgiven their voices .
of course , it can happen much to change the change , and no one can really say , never the opinion .
46 percent said that they are open to change the door to change other candidates .
however , Tr@@ umps strongest competition in the moment of the other external side , the Neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ urg Ben Car@@ son , but v@@ oters that they have formed their opinion , are twice as frequently for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ can say that they agree with tr@@ ump at the theme of Immig@@ ration .
since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was called for two months of immigrants from Mexico , &quot; the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ point in public discrimination in 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ ance of Tr@@ ump @-@ American H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans keep damaged by the Republi@@ can Party and will be damaged .
but after the new ABC / mail survey from Monday to say six of 10 Republi@@ kan@@ ers that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of the Immig@@ ration .
so long as the immig@@ ration remains in the ramp , it will also be Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration about the government climb to new high@@ ways .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters , especially through their external side status .
six of 10 Republi@@ can say in the new Mont@@ es@@ cent survey of ABC / Post , they want to prefer a political external side than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa before two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Republi@@ can occur in the Congress of fru@@ str@@ ates , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;

the twel@@ f@@ law@@ less in series will be the first step towards final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ Tor@@ were Roberto , who had to pass a flange shot of the World Champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; had Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot blossom fans - and the Munich was thought .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without to shine .
Piraeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal class , among them against nam@@ ing clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ Du@@ els with Greek teams didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they went brave , with their obvious efforts often too works .
the attacks were often led by playing on Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , who came against the previous win Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more happiness , when his flange came out from the right half field in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , as the Olympics @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown the head ball of the Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct , the Tor@@ were Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 3@@ 5th ) .

but on Tor@@ hil@@ ter Manuel New was Ver@@ sions .
as he had a shot of ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New left Gu@@ ardi@@ ola with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat outside .
the WM @-@ hero was given only after the final training green light , Sports Board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it that is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the an@@ gled Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meters , Müller still sat down .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ all .

who rough , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who is smo@@ ked , so that not only the lungs , but also the teeth of a Potsdam &apos;s long term study .
the good news : the risk is quickly rapidly .
smo@@ kers have significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this goes out of the long term study of an international research teams , among them several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking causes the risk of risk to lose their teeth , around 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ F@@ ache higher .

main causes for denti@@ als be c@@ aries and inflammation of the tooth , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk of risk for this par@@ o@@ don@@ tit@@ is .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss will therefore go back to the common dental loss of smo@@ kers .
don &apos;t be clari@@ fied , because smoking increases the risk for K@@ aries .
people who heard with smoking , but could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the companions will be back on the level of non @-@ smoking , first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
you are able to convince people to become non @-@ smoking , study leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the life time . &quot;
not too smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge of dental health up to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population are affected at the age of 65 to 74 years of denti@@ sts , divided the DI@@ f@@ E .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the question@@ ing of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the question@@ ed of the Prime Minister with voltage .
the new Labour president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the question@@ ed of the Prime Minister and put himself for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after lunch , with its power from the media probably and the Labour member of the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because it comes after his appointment to the member of the shadow of inet@@ ts and after his speech at Tu@@ c @-@ Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the Sin@@ gens of the National hym@@ n at a commem@@ oration of the National Academy in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS , and stands in the center of several title pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not the National hym@@ n to sing , has attention to himself
a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he would have suffered &quot; in respec@@ tful silence , &quot; and he did the &quot; hero@@ ic around the Royal Air Force in the air . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , O@@ wen Smith , told at the BBC Two News@@ night program , he told the Labour chairman , &quot; regardless of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadows ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top team , and they called upon differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a se@@ ven@@ el of the Parliamentary Party was originally supported as a leader .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences is also involved within the Labour &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s position to the European Union and the limit .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the Tu@@ c Conference said that Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow work and R@@ ent Minister said that the party was very clear , &quot; that it is very clear to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour president , David Cameron , since then he has been in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament .
the Labour president who has promised another politicians , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions concerning Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister to con@@ front is , and that he will be able to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , which is represented at the shadow of taver@@ n , if he is not part - for example when Mr. Cameron is on the road .
he also brought the idea to talk to the word that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he said John Ber@@ ch who talked about the problem of the sub@@ house .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is involved in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theat@@ res , which is often associated with the question@@ ed of the Prime Minister . but some years later he had a man that he was in it .
since it was sent first in 1990 , the question@@ er was sent by the prime minister of a leader and his leadership in the sub@@ house and his position under his parliamentary elections , although critics have become a car@@ ic@@ uous reforms .

Met@@ cash starts ground floor campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - Immig@@ ration
Met@@ ric tries to protect IG@@ A stores in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ grandfather Met@@ cash has started to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and Western Australia will be prepared in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of the next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A through Main@@ stream marketing and marketing via the Social Media , as well as events as Adelaide show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer Simm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ borough , which sell used in IG@@ A @-@ shops samples and charging owners , which sell used tickets for the South Australian football liga to faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will be published for further details of his defense strategy on September 29 , when the major tra@@ ders of food , alcohol and devices will pass through its annual investors strategy .
it stands much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs IG@@ A @-@ Lad@@ en@@ ings and higher winning mar@@ gins as Met@@ cas@@ hs IG@@ A network in the east states .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ian province and IG@@ A single market have a lot more stronger market than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the east states .
however , anal@@ ysts such as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and all existing acc@@ ents , but mainly self @-@ standing retailers sales .
a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley , that IG@@ A @-@ retailers per year and Met@@ cash 250 million will lose up to the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the acceptance that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will achieve a turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery store in the amounts of Met@@ cas@@ hs high fixation price could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ di and Col@@ es , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently performed survey of Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A @-@ purchases are the faithful .
Morgan Stanley takes over to reduce the Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 will reduce the market share of 14 percent to 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of Met@@ cash was added to contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market has been dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs and food trading , which is about 43 percent , which is reflected in the operating school for simultaneous pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , however , more than 150 million $ , in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths with hundreds of products every week and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at the improvement of their shops through fast growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ hs main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the pricing and charging programs will return to Elan for the first time in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis court Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves rather praise as criticism for its behavior .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ision damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special KS , which is always called &quot; Special KS &quot; with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
in a fiery qualifying game in Cincinn@@ ati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the arbit@@ rator , whereby Harrison is called Cy@@ gios twice , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last , as he had seen a tennis bat , after a cr@@ ush a pot@@ ent US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth , at the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in Davis @-@ Cup half @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; a thing about which I was quite looking forward , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was a little in the battle , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
he lost a bat when he lost a bat in the US Open in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has led a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has extremely well behavior in the US Open in the US Open circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think that he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around itself , he has a great family around around , and I believe that he was a little too strictly treated .
he is a very rei@@ fer 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits a problem with the other players , it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves it to be judged after his own service .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision , Cy@@ gios on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all , but he will return to the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term component of the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team focuses on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ aries around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick was done very quickly the Ascension , and deserves all the criticism of the public , and he could try to support him out of the end of the public , but we try to think him the consequences of its trading . and it is best for adequate , and it is best for the team , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee camp : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and ri@@ pped the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all firm who tried to stop illegal in the country . all with the aim to stop the stream of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials .
people who were fled from violence , for a unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and settled tents and left there .
but Fru@@ it rose up .
when a police driver about them , the migrants &quot; Public &quot; is the border ! &quot; and sh@@ rie@@ ve Bel@@ ei@@ vers against the Hungarian army .
some resulting from protest food and water back .
Ser@@ bi@@ ens Minister said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision damage .
there must be held in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague .
the Tur@@ bul@@ ences at the Hungarian Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a strict meeting in Brussels .
the Minister agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who finally sought to share in Italy and Greece . they received their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would have further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria will be scheduled to discuss a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immig@@ ration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , however , his hopes are not on a bal@@ med action of Brussels or from his neigh@@ bors .
on Tuesday , the not@@ ch not@@ ices in two southern regions gave more Be@@ fu@@ g@@ ations to the crisis , so they could accelerate roads and asylum procedure .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also began to stop the construction of a sp@@ inning wire to stop the stream of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even to create the b@@ ular wire fence between Hungary and Serbia , were used .
in the last months of Hungary , Hungary is for many prisoners of war from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant Eng@@ pass and to the entrance point in the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , however , that most of the coming economic attacks are , which are looking for protection after a better life - a view , which is strong in the contra@@ diction to other EU states , among them Germany .
the new laws that came around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the corrupt of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us to build the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also lay higher liability for the human rights .
&quot; due to the situation , the Hungarian government was created by the mass government , the government of the emergency state &quot; said government of Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ations in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very much : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , but repor@@ tedly have been expected for the next week , but repor@@ tedly have been seen at the border difficult armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have 45 people at the attempt to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come over by using the fence , they are in police , and shall be accused of off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
in the morning , Hungarian officials made two of the seven border with Serbia , after a train car with Stach@@ el@@ wire to close the borders .
chaos gave the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and a human quantity to get there .
about 20 people come to come , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants received the most important motorway connection of Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would have to travel food and water , until they are travelling to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former U.S. Foreign Minister Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to continue a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race to national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins its opposite floor .
Clinton has now support the support of 47 percent of the democratic v@@ oters in the suburbs ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ different on the second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not been announced , whether he receives the presidential election , the support of 15 percent of the democratic v@@ oters .
more than five months before the pre @-@ elections , the most democratic v@@ oters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is festive , what candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ics Supp@@ orters are in their choice than the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey has lost Clinton at a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ different profits achieved .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and mixtures , but these pre@@ judi@@ ces have reduced .
their support with men is significantly lower , and S@@ different is just 5 points here .
Clin@@ ics benefit from democratic v@@ oters under 50 years of age , and they are now on the same height .
Clinton has a great lead to the older v@@ oters .
in the past month , Clinton was launched with two @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ al , but S@@ different has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic v@@ oters of the suburbs , they would support with enthusiasm Clinton when they would nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some pre@@ serving and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the Candi@@ date .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ics are current support mainly from her .
the views are stronger with those who currently not support Clinton - only one quarter would support them .
during 48 percent of the democratic elections of democratic elections , they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters to Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
if Clin@@ ics Supp@@ orted in an open question , why it is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) that it is time that it is time ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
their connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned in conjunction with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and v@@ eins are also cited .
since the vice @-@ president has been a potential for the presidential office in the orph@@ ans , would like 57 percent of the democratic elections to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic v@@ oters are asked , who would be asked for the party their second choice , is Bi@@ den at the top .
of Clin@@ ics trailer say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far far from S@@ different .
however , Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics increases before S@@ different , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic v@@ oters see Clinton as candidate in with the best chances to win the choice ; however , this number of 78 per cent has fallen in the last month .
Bi@@ den is with a distance of this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; selectable &quot; . &quot;
nevertheless , when the question is more important , the Democratic v@@ oters call questions about the v@@ ability .
similar to the last month , there is no only negative candidate or potential candidate for these v@@ oters as in@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates make good results with some important features of v@@ oters in the suburbs of their party .
consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as an honest and trusted and familiar with strong guide .
Bi@@ den cuts in the three candidates at hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ ics strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic v@@ oters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that over S@@ different ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic v@@ oters in general elections in general also Clinton , S@@ different and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic v@@ oters have no opinion of S@@ different .
as questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics using a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an outside of the term , most Democratic v@@ oters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in total .
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are un@@ happy with its explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans told that the e @-@ mail control has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly Rep@@ ub@@ ans , more than six of 10 that are saying that their views of Clinton has become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered v@@ oters : only 32 per cent they see as honest and trusted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less than in May .
62 per cent of the election do not hold it for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elec@@ toral organisation also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trusted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump however , however , good notes of guidance .
from the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush &apos;s best at hon@@ esty .
a majority looks rather than hon@@ estly , but as at Car@@ son have many no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic v@@ oters in the front elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is a further survey near Donald Tr@@ ump behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the two candidates , half of the support of the v@@ oters in the new survey , and other lose dramatically .
rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters continue to support tr@@ ump in large number . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted by Fox News debate in recent month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sch@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey resulted in demo@@ graphic groups of demo@@ graphic groups well and tr@@ ump under rep@@ ubli@@ can v@@ oters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Kas@@ ich , has fallen by Wis@@ con@@ scienti@@ ous Governor Scott Walker , which is the deepest last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former Governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % on the third place .

the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , the last week was published , shows that Car@@ son is in the surveys - he lan@@ ted at 19 % support with the Republi@@ can , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a look at one of the last week , Tr@@ ump found Tr@@ ump some side of the former Neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen , even after Car@@ son himself ap@@ ologi@@ ze , tr@@ umps faith in question .

&quot; at this point , the members began to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood in the Brotherhood of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police Wagner Wagner .

this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
a tick is coming , and the house will rise to Wan@@ ken , R@@ end@@ ites will rise for bonds , and the economy will lead into a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long does it take and how long will keep it .
in particular , the history of the economy offers a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ sion of the Federal Reserve is often often , if not always , a factor as the economy and financial plants react .
therefore , representative of the US Central Bank thus emphas@@ izes that investors should not focus on , when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end of the market , market share could determine that the whole excitement may be over@@ lap .
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Head of Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal heights , but still on low level to fear to se@@ is@@ mic shock who seem to fear many .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a historical trends based on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market in the last month , the pre@@ ference can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l .
once the increase meets , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that is reflected in the monetary policy of 12 to 24 months after the first increase in monetary policy , the German @-@ Bank anal@@ ysts are reflected in a newer study , which happens after tick @-@ caves of the F@@ ed .
in the past 35 years , the market is mostly in the past 35 years later , with an average end of the past six years later ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to the normal state after 500 days , with an average end of the past six days after a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , boss @-@ Strat@@ ege at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares will occur later in the Incre@@ ase cycle and the end of the return starts to decrease .
recipes are a fact of economic life , but tick @-@ caves often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions who did not have to accelerate it before .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point at a brick point of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank since 1950 , the nominal GDP since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few that this will take place and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter of the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
if it could be ris@@ ky in such a frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop , &quot; if it is different , &quot; if it is different , &quot; the German Bank said .
market shares have made the whole year on a tick of the F@@ ed , and all the eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many Strat@@ ers and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC is an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trade show only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all the Incre@@ ases cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing the GDP in GDP and Pre @-@ recipes very quickly after the beginning of the recovery in the shadow , &quot; the report .
in contrast , this is an clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession was in the follow phase .
the current cycle is far from the longest , which has been waiting for the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market is a constant increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds faster than in shares if the strategic course change .
in bonds the edges seem to change the direction , as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle .
at the end of the Incre@@ ase cycle , the attacks fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the Strat@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to the interest rate between longer and shorter bonds closer to the curve .
highly competitive bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful , higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come anal@@ yst@@ in at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting , Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; next to the strength of the dollars and the decline of inflation , there are some signs that the market has been adapted to the view of the more powerful monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , credit card has increased , credit and the Vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all features of the market , if the F@@ ed is w@@ asted their strategy .
in the big and all companies , the larger part of their business activity in the USA will benefit from it if interest rates and local products are attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will become worse , since an increasing dollars on the global market is more expensive and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares are very positive to react three months after an initial interest , &quot; he said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ anal@@ ysts in a report for customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded companies in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at the average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital R@@ end@@ ites as well as low Vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also met their pen@@ ing with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most of them , he said Gold@@ man .
consumers outside of pure stock games will also benefit from the increasing dollar .
austerity could see profits by higher income , even if experts are different , how fast it will take place .

he said , &quot; I said my wife yesterday evening , &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house is , but &quot; no one will become excited . &quot;
the police asked the attacks after his name , but he gave him not .
he had no explanation for his sciss@@ ors .
when police took the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written not@@ iz from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am so sorry , I could do it .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can do not play for double question@@ naire because of double cargo
Luke Sha@@ w was at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven , a double fra@@ cture of his right hand .
while this , Louis van G@@ hall brought him up for at least six months from playing games , Louis van G@@ hall will not play the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the violation was caused by a backwards attack by H@@ é@@ tat Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and required oxygen before he was brought into hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double bass and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United is very difficult , and then it is fantastic , and then happens .
he had a oxygen mas@@ ke in the conversion .
he wept .
I am no doctor but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red map and the delay of a ellip@@ se .
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ ration , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van G@@ aal is convinced that the Italian arbit@@ ration was wrong .
you can judge himself if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe you , as broken I am , my way , I will come back again . &quot;
this is based on : Manchester United States suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat of PS@@ V
the England defender with the European Championship in France has an additional incen@@ tive to recover until the coming June .
Phillip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said , &quot; It is a very bad violation . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players , a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg from Mexico to Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad violation , it is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing that I could see was the ball that was in another direction , when he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like it feels like hard .
I feel very bad . I feel so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ play of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron is better ?
it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
it is because you are David Cameron .
when he was asked from a provider of child care systems , his favorite child book decided to call the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ ien@@ ene Environmental Protection of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writing Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and drives : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I &apos;d like to give my children , because it seems to be missed so far . &quot;
all nice and well , except the subsequent paragraph , in Cameron , the action of the book describes the action of the film version instead of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the quite short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the surrounding town of Th@@ ap@@ y , where all nature has gone to win a young man called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y was filled with her desire to see a real tree , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss host@@ el , and the 1991 died , but completely unknown .
as if that doesn &apos;t work enough , the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie which will be presented as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial and even the air is a product called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he says to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems to be familiar , like the local environment the action of the book is so little familiar with the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ les , &quot; that is in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was transferred to a hel@@ per , the Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times a child .
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ speaking in said that the text probably come from Camer@@ ons campaign .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text by Camer@@ ons employees was delivered , but no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England , but it &apos;s still difficult
to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one has chosen the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour has been selected , is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series not on my card .
I would not have a trigger victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks page is possibly less than the three years ago , but there is a good spin @-@ player in Batt@@ ing locations , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not bear a fool of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball developed Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
on the following message : Adam Ly@@ th has been replaced from the England @-@ Test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to analyze Adam Ly@@ th , of course , of course , is of course for me as his head trainer in Yorkshire , difficult to analyze .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ player are based on results .
there was no question@@ ing signs at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I have said this - players their own best extin@@ ction .
a long time ago you had extended the run of ly@@ th , but he had the control over his own fate .
if he suggests further information for Yorkshire , there is another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor of Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he was not so good services , and that surprised me , he is not a team man .
the question , how much time a test for@@ man receives to set his signs , is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play and play .
the only pre@@ ference that one can rise in the Caribbean - as a Ly@@ th in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a whi@@ pped , which I take up high .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw in Yorkshire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which was very met with us .
he must receive at least the same chances as before him , but this depends on course in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would bring a Extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four qu@@ icks , and I didn &apos;t have anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a man can &apos;t beat there , and this left has already been shown that he is an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no great difference .
my early 38 tests Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests during the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he has made three hundred R@@ us immediately and looked back .
Z@@ i@@ Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics at an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball and think it is a Pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers who decided their hands and the trainer have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few clever additions at the train@@ ers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master .
he is one of the most beautiful candle of the game that has an abundance of experiences , because he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , when players or coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has to benefit from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze , even if the messages are in harmony with the before .
col@@ ys team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ mates do not determine the schedule .
and you have to think that how to carry their jobs by the results .
such decisions are not made of slight heart .

Germany , the Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has left the ministry since 10 years before it is bad for it , as it is bad for it , as it is bad for it , as it has been done for it as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande looks at his re@@ election or its creation in 2017 .

it is hard to help themselves to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should not be used to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should not want to prevent it , because most similar separate ten@@ dencies have to be used .
therefore , some such ministers may not be confident , completely in the SN@@ P @-@ style , while the Great Britain process will accelerate the Bre@@ xit process to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process .
&quot; the re@@ vocation was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the re@@ trial . &quot;

you can remember Boris Johnson , the brass @-@ euro Opp@@ ortun@@ ists , who made a name as a &quot; EU Court ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 years .
he knew Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
this belonged to the Med@@ ley &apos;s Med@@ ley Sch@@ ur@@ ken , telephone h@@ ack@@ ers and the p@@ seudo non @-@ In@@ states that have most of our large newspapers .

it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and in television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s Ern@@ est John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea .
it ended me to the 70 @-@ year old when his old father was painted in television to be painted in television against his Labour cabinet , without going to go to and his cab@@ inet@@ ts@@ job job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was still attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances , &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not that Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C said to all reports on the Monday evening .
what always wants to think about Cor@@ by@@ n image from Cor@@ by@@ n - think about it - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ cture of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat .
it is correct , Cameron does not give a free ticket for Europe to keep him , Lab@@ ours support in the lecture campaign for a self @-@ understanding , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said .

but some researchers have set up the capacity of data in@@ quire and refer to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a Editorial in the medical trade magazine Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extremely tiny basis , &quot; based on the P@@ he his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical epidemic at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public is expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of post@@ ure and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people to develop a model for a multi @-@ critical criteria @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damages of different nic@@ otine inhal@@ er products ; the results of the meeting were combined in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director previously received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for a independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to the meeting , means of an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have been added to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ths are not delivered , but they belong to several known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify a industries financing in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco direction of P@@ he participated in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he that &quot; it has no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have no way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that on the claims of BM@@ J already re@@ acts before .
he said : &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers die in his Su@@ cht .
all evidence is close to study the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to this , but we continue to study the long term effects .
P@@ he has the unique duty to the information of the public on what is the proof and what does not mean , when it gives as much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually at a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs two billion £ per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes is not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of poll@@ ut@@ ens , which is caused by smoking by smoking , we meet our national vision .
BBC should give East@@ en@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said to send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give to their right arm , &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the circular fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transmitter .
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they are publicly seen publicly @-@ legal programs that will probably be seen from a smaller audience , in hard @-@ round time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General director , Tony Hall , said that he wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , said Johnson , that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are shown in order or sends it clearly of non subtle ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the circular charge , I should not hold its production at least for a good idea , one should not make its production at least on programs , which do not do or in order .
you send the Voice in a first class window because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ culous , it is natural sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a rainy tax programs are financed , which could be financed without sub@@ ventions .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ en@@ ders is another , assigned both own productions .
hon@@ estly , others would give other channels to their right arm .
I am looking forward to see how this is public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is working on the hunt for the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular Shows of the BBC give back to the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ en@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that they should not measure the public legal N@@ ic programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 , but they do not fulfill their tasks , and they can increase their tasks , &quot; now , of course , we have created all these ob@@ jection programs that nobody has seen all these programs . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody wanted to see them .
for the radio fee , Johnson said : &quot; I need to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of terms of conditions who can get the best value .
of course , remember all that you get a big value for 150 £ per year here , but for people who is right for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether it is right , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called the BBC their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to inform , and talk . &quot;
he said only little from the BBC production now - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio and Canada should be able to inform them in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only one hand@@ fully in TV are shown , and with the commercial sen@@ ders of alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ o will change the direction towards the moment , in which they are bent with sound .
scientists have bred dice with gen@@ tically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ o change the direction towards the moment , in which they have caused by sound , which have to be heard for the human hearing , to be heard .
the impul@@ ses work through the switch of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which can be changed to wear the cone channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers told the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics which can be used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
T@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day the depths of brain stimulation could replace the electric impul@@ ses to treatment of the symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ spicy react usually not to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani had set it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bladder , he found out the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves are called structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ channels are called and found in the membran@@ es of some of the saus@@ ages .
the sound waves are the opening of these I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ channels and activate the cells that they are assigned , such a report of Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound controlled Nem@@ at@@ ani , the wor@@ ms modified the wor@@ ms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ channels .
when he turns on the changed creatures , the sound waves will be increased and transferred into the wor@@ ms where they turn the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ graphy , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientist , neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , the Low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic fabric can happen and can be sent so into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gen@@ therapy and therapeutic virus it is possible to make human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ productive cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in students
before eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but now I remember the an@@ gled smile of those who I took me - and to the numerous , slow complaints about others .
most of what I learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entry in students is sufficient from slightly ner@@ ves up to absolutely dis@@ appo@@ inting .
it is sh@@ red@@ ded to sh@@ aking : people tell you , where you get in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you are hon@@ estly , because you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you are hon@@ estly , because in Ernst , guys , it is only a He@@ fe@@ eder ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
the conversation and helps you to find people that you may not speak in contrast , even if your eyelashes would not speak , even if your eyelashes would be found in fire .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people are often transform in drinks @-@ recipes , film @-@ night event and communist meeting , but they are also the places where people can wear and their under@@ wear .
this is based on : remember , do not think of the Uni with a relationship with a relationship .
intro@@ ver@@ ted a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a Refu@@ gi@@ um , but many student living room form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ bo@@ mel culture , the kind and soci@@ ally and social friendship can lead to life .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I will go back to our friendship , but you must go back to the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a Com@@ mil@@ it@@ one of Ges@@ el@@ ness is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
ap@@ rop@@ os purchase : do it .
a guy in my students had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship by baking .
since you start the Uni to the climax of the Back Man@@ ie , is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years . &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have somewhat baked . so , and now please smile when I have a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade athletes offer is a good way to close friends .
your room@@ mate feel committed to talk and will be associated with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad miss cl@@ ump@@ en from flour , sugar and fat lead that people are sleeping .
food to steal , is a real crime in students .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it a drop of a drop for your tea ?
check the milk with the dairy .
the chances are good that they say to operate himself , even if they cook in the in@@ sect .
if any one has put your stuff , and you have my sympathy - but try to be balanced as my fellow living , which added to their milk , to be punished by th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about to be a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ ts to the people who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my hall asked their neigh@@ bors , whether it makes them a little bit , drum &amp; bass something le@@ iser , because it had three clock in the morning , and she had a exam .
they re@@ acted with another music .
when she heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours even two hours before they left their own music pl@@ agu@@ ed her door , and went to their dre@@ aming examination .
would it not be romantic when your future sp@@ ouses would be randomly into the same student home ?
the vice versa would not be deep , if you have to make a room@@ mate for your future sp@@ ouse , they will be separate and may experience every day , as they may see all their common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a name is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , you will try to speak at least your under@@ wear .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice his key in his non @-@ closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mobile , it seems to be .
a good track is funny , but it takes only eye views until he will take part .
share a valuable and am@@ use@@ able lesson on safety - but do never forget someone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and shampoo .
close their door , and put their keys into a glass of water , which you are in the freezer - but there are no more owners at the ceiling no longer than twice .
friction houses for refugees , all@@ ots , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ er
the real estate site Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds a lot of money for people who did not have much money .
so for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the Mother &apos;s mother and Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and well @-@ build , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview
thousands of refugees are on the housing market .
entrepren@@ eurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how rapidly cheaper living room can be created : he builds in a project of friction houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are on the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the major accommodation in containers or gym has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
in view of the refugee camp , we also need enough living room for the next decades .
a quite ban@@ ales , dre@@ ig@@ ated house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a stone house needs to be a lot of place .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
that is different if one brings people in residential blocks .
each of the six houses which are built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say , there is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square metre space per house is located at 184 000 euros , without property .
this is crowded .
the building lasts six months .
that is adequate .
did the construction regulations have their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : building legally legally drawn my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated , it always makes the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ ist special construction and the positions .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still underground , who creates three apartments at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing for this place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their own house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there was what who have thrown me to create luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but do not drop the competitors to paid apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true , but we had built in the last five years , we were built in the last five years , but luxury apartments were hardly able to afford any more .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the Mother &apos;s mother or Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ er .
I show how to build even today and well build well .
therefore it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple update will be published
the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot;
when it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some are according to the installation , as they receive an error message that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to handle the problem , users are recommended , either to wait until the tower goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly be the del@@ etion of apps to create space - but Apple has become easier to delete this , if you need a special tool to delete apps , and then it will be new to install apps as soon as the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged or in the vicinity of a charging device , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple is not too low that the update will be continued , as the phone may lead to half way and may lead to a departure of updates .

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border are also based on our southern border , &quot; said the Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Colum@@ ner .
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
as before be clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum entry , this is also of course &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear , &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less mig@@ rant currents , also not about the Austrian Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia , &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously reported to continue Slovenia &apos;s upcoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under circumstances also cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
so this is the interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensive .
the border with Croatia be controlled as an external limit of the shaft , however , already controlled .
as the Minister was stressed , Slovenia wants to produce his borders for refugees but not a abri@@ a .
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system does not work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had tried to travel in the night hours on Tuesday , in Ost@@ k@@ roati@@ an at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , to travel to the registration .
Croatian Police was able to attack them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik meeting the police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly around Sy@@ rer and Afgh@@ an , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already used in use .
in the coming days there will be a country with around 4000 refugees , the Minister of Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ on@@ ian Serbian border , which previously led to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
however , the government in Belgrade , however , that it is to strike certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , &quot; called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , at least 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border of S@@ id , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
there were the whole night from around 500 kilometres away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has said that Hungary has told us that we are here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in fact , it could now have already been a significant shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Serbia to a bit further west distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities to limit control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ized that his country is prepared for the case of a strong conc@@ ei@@ ms of refugees .
details called he , but he did not know that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities to limit control . &quot;
they lead str@@ ingent controls through to qualify for membership in the shaft space .
Slovenia belongs to the country since 2007 , the EU partners represent a good testimony that affects the standard of the border .
on Serbian side , there are about 300 refugees in the Hungarian border .
according to siege of the media reports , they would have been at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian interior Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to be calm early in Hor@@ gos at a local court in Hor@@ gos , after the Hungarian border is closed , after the Hungarian border is closed .
it would not be at present at very high Refu@@ ge@@ aring .
you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country would continue .
hel@@ pers for migrants - dangerous - Alternative rou@@ gh@@ ted
however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already begun to distribute the refugees to the refugees , on which alternative routes are characterized by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ dangerous : in parts of the border area there is still 20 years after the end of Croatia .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian Police announced that a team of min@@ ef@@ ers was sent in the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , Finance outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer gigs on a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his body transfers .
the company said that it plans to be about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company 50.000 seasonal workers would like to set for the holiday time .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening ceremony on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said , a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends 20 cents less than in the previous forecast .
anal@@ ysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower views will be effective despite the price increases the average rating of 4.@@ 9 percent and on 4 January and despite higher list@@ ings of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said that it can still expect the result compared to the previous year due to cost savings , higher revenue and due to growth in online stock .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is solid result , if you are weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holidays employment were announced a day later than the Riv@@ al UPS , which plans , 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as in the last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked anal@@ ysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked anal@@ ysts expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has brought a decline in the last years a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipping .
but the boom in the online shopping has increased results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 percent , but the operative result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the Express unit reported higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result is due to higher working costs in the cargo business .
in Pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , san@@ ken the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0,15 $ .

the card is a memory of that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ els and their colleagues will set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two times of the Congress : Maxim@@ ation of the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the large recession the F@@ ed leaders have been recognized that there is an unlimited third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mand@@ ate could be announced that the X @-@ factor in a decision be announced that the US economy is ready to be done on Thursday if the US economy is ready to become a short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy show that it grows solid , the youngest Tur@@ bul@@ ences could have already increased by the global financial markets in the global financial markets , this Vol@@ at@@ ility could be increased by the attacks of the Zin@@ c for federal government - and be it just one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in first line will be the most important , what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief economic growth in the mac@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ cker Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when they were looking for a pre@@ wall , the interest rate is not to increase interest in the global market enough , continue to wait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed will do what is the financial market itself .
about half of the Ö@@ kon@@ y , which were recently written by Bloom@@ berg , have said this week .
however , the financial markets are expected to wait with a key indi@@ an , which shows just a 30 % chance to increase an increase .
this indicates a drop of the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , it is because the Strat@@ ist@@ ers refused the blow out by they promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , Dow Jones Industrial Average value at 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy was exciting in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief of Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the phr@@ ases to this point , &quot; he said .
if they do it , &quot; should they go very far in her statement to do the financial markets , so that they are not in panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that one of the financial markets would be the financial markets because they would act the un@@ certainty , when the F@@ ed would act .
even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0,@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow waste of mon@@ et@@ ting conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ els had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of Liber@@ al , that more economic progress would be required to expect an increase of Satan .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ down , the improvement was solid on the labour market in this year .
the unemployment rate decreased by 5.1 % in the last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels , which sees the F@@ ed as full @-@ time .
pay@@ ers have shown signs of a recovery .
and even though the inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative , that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can reduce higher interest rates and needs them because of the voltage on the labour market , &quot; he said Ian Mis@@ d@@ son , chief of panic at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets at the end of the last month , after China had taken its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % under its highest level , as investors were afraid that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would be the global growth of the Chinese economy .
the market has some 10 % in this month , the Dow now has almost 10 % under the h@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed representative influence the market turbul@@ ence the complex calculation when you increase interest .
&quot; if the events would not have occurred on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , she said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff .
now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impacts on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is one of the main focus on the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ decision .
but in the final effect , the F@@ ed monetary policy has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .
the blo@@ c note of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; can be removed from around the globe .
in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies , they are expected to monitor by the F@@ ed representative , but also with other central banks and experts advise to obtain a better understanding for the global economy .
its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary car@@ amel , Head of the global strategy of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey lacquered , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , this month that &quot; the F@@ ed is a story of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements , which are not associated with the economic Fund@@ ament@@ al@@ data . &quot;
painted , a complete member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de for a rule of the Federal Open Market Committee , the decisions made in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their conduc@@ ts in three sessions &quot; despite a limited effects on growth in the USA . &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these pumpkin seeds .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis such as Mark@@ tz@@ us@@ ry 2008 to the first place , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England .
the youngest Tur@@ bul@@ ences are not close to this plane , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double Mand@@ ate and not mentioned the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be the time .

in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started up the workers .
they gathered the garbage , the tenth of thousands of thousands in the past few weeks left the road .
plywood have been dismant@@ led and rebuilt in the border place in the border place .
for the aim of this Umb@@ ria , nobody wanted to express itself .
Austria reach the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country also has increased its border controls .
in order to cross the 20,000 migrants , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the further trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the German authorities in the morning .
in free@@ way , a small groups of refugees met a small groups of refugees .
mayor drove &quot; stud &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday , when suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the Zel@@ ts , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ one mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to meet with the train to Passau .
because Germany on Sunday , because of the refugee camp , the railway traffic with Austria was surprisingly , for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately put his help with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Na@@ he Passau .
previously , we had the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once again , with J@@ ause and beverages .
we have said the same , we bring them by car to Passau .
&quot; that was of course of course , &quot; so city in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man did not take it to pass a generous donation - 100 euros for fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that is very pleased to us , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in Wels from a ICE in Wels from a ICE in a regional train direction Passau , that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still over the border to try .
the regional suit was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein is the border crossing generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neigh@@ bors with the Bavarian neigh@@ bors on Sunday , day before a branch is organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further Z@@ ig@@ thousands of us , is a logical result of a apparent holy policy :
instead of the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the construction of structures , our Federal Chancellor , our Chancellor was officially officially and public the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ ist of the National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ verse of these policy are not only those Austrian , which are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions .
also the ge@@ aring will have to determine that the &quot; gel@@ ob@@ te Land , &quot; which she invited and welcome nothing than another refugee camp .
there will be a great challenge , in view of the refugee vessels and the winter of winter , with us human beings for protective search for protection .
and there will be a bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 in fixed Quar@@ tet
Konrad has full to do all hands with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is it that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first quarter of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received Konrad already in the handle .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
also the accommodation of 20.000 refugees who had come to Austria , be without a big host , said Konrad and lob@@ te the organiz@@ ational &quot; Master performance . &quot;
the interior of the Ministry spoke of a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad with a need of 85@@ ,000 Quar@@ tet in the Hebrew year .
to meet the number , in the next few weeks , 35@@ ,000 accommodations will be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 shall provide the countries to provide 15,000 of the covenant .
should it be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but there is no f@@ ass without soil , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already managed talks with the country .
these would be secured him to create him even for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it runs well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be glorified , as the church will help .
great expectations sets the asylum coordin@@ ator also in the ORF action &quot; helmets like we . &quot;
private individuals can offer private individuals .
in addition to hotels you can stand on hotels in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in emergency times it could not be to keep a certain height of the towel or size of the upper side .
for a short time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; apply .
in contrast to the interior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older Lord , which you do not say without further into the face .
beliefs is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er does not cause the republic , as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their employees on three to four .
the own partner was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to make a container at a office area as office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better result
only the opening of urban sport and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is currently not necessary , since you could have to be able without these measures , the Mayor of Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergency , other locations should be tested on their pi@@ ds .
criticism of the City of refugees in the federal state of refugees within the federal states .
other districts must also afford their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not rounded &quot;
in a longer phone calls with the Bavarian Minister of Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the state of Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the other pre@@ judi@@ ces in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has insured me that the German borders are not rounded .
the journey of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , it now give the corresponding border controls .
special feature with refugees to Germany will not be no more .
however , the protective search would be brought with regular trains to Germany .
from the other EU member states called P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once more reinforced solidarity in the refugee request .
in Austria , Austria will also lead to its borders for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , &quot; a logical consequence , &quot; from the fore@@ front of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the General of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the Group &apos;s production facility is made to the rest ( 2700 square meters ) , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented in young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT are the smart heads of our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ boss Hannes Nieder@@ house .
he could imagine to invest in the start @-@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and later .
at the beginning of the beginning , S &amp; T with the new neigh@@ bors will cooperate with the new neigh@@ bors . &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros by Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land Ober@@ österreich and the covenant ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is classified by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square metre area in the building are already rented for further 40 percent .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ it opened second shop in the Ark@@ ade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the centre .
actually Jutta wanted to get a dog .
this project had to break the 49 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ itation of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ ds @-@ Ark@@ ade . finally she got a further business in the form of another business .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop compared to the business , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , footwear and clothing of various manufacturers , is now all around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , cash tables are from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday , the new shop has been in operation .
several weeks ago has been rebuilt .
&quot; I have long over@@ lays , if I open a shop , &quot; says wide .
important for the decision was among others that the Fur@@ la producer who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location , which were sold to only their hand@@ bags .
&quot; we are the one in the large area of Linz , who sell these brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , even the Italian roots .
your fashion interest has got wide from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
me , most , if something is developed and I can show new trends at present prices .
why so some woman with the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , can also answer the professional woman with the last security .
maybe it is that a beautiful bag can be used every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants is called .
this property connects man@@ cher also with the milli@@ ard@@ ants , the US President will be .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he feels foreign , journalists , or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applicants for the US presidential Office .
and cuts well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate .
the New York City with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ ris@@ ur is many in the win@@ eg@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants place is beyond -@@ zig corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ urban Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ ine has turned a am@@ use@@ able documentary about the place and its famous jumps , to those besides Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for fittings , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) is also successful with the statement that he would certainly be successful when he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the heart , he did not take it there .
however , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random name of the top name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to high @-@ German : the An@@ ders , says it .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather was opened and opened in the USA a restaurant for gold st@@ ber .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate site were first basic sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of traction : their desire to return to home in the homeland of the Bavarian State , which belonged to the Palat@@ inate .
he didn &apos;t recorded Tr@@ ump because it was once without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic History and Volk@@ sk@@ ies , Roland Paul , to film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal extin@@ ction . &quot;
this stands in contrast to the marked statements of the afternoon .
it was repeated due to Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and the construction of a border wall , to move illegal immigrants .
&quot; such as the pol@@ ishing , it is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a little Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz . &quot; ) .
the win@@ zer in the retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ orted , &quot; he is always so dark thousand . &quot;
do he believes that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; that can &apos;t imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cares about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ alties in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter that a visit to the family Heinz at a visit to the church , which was generally good .
&quot; that can &apos;t imagine me from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they are better when he does not understand the choice , for &quot; who has such radical views , I don &apos;t know whether it is good . &quot;
if those who had had the time of his grandfather in the US , as he had never arrived , &quot; he would never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ast Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and when President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; says it .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for the tr@@ ump long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ ations , also in the USA .
the top Bavarian Community Ram@@ s@@ au at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ ades is the first &quot; Berg@@ amo village . &quot;
from the hand of the Vice President of the German alpine club , Ludwig Wu@@ er@@ en@@ nig , received the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ ades on Wednesday the award for gentle tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain sti@@ ff@@ les . &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may possibly be un@@ fortun@@ ate who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor of the Bachelor , was formed in the largest secret .
and no of the three left of the left girl will certainly not give if it is that the last rose has received .
but when we have been with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you may possibly have a note that who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips until the final on Thursday .
all three women have left in ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called its sense for hum@@ our , hon@@ ors , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner in his partner .
however , if the question is made , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; , could be their answers to play , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki @-@ called both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and SA@@ MS energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I have thought that it was quite compatible with the course of the show , and I said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the correct chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she would be well suited and Sam Wood as a pair .
from her sight , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week you made clear that Wood &quot; of the One could be . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , I was obvious that this obviously is not only a game - I am now subject to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , who will choose Wood , if not them , as she was s@@ wis@@ ely .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say , &quot; she said .
I love the left girl alike - it is a Un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is scheduled on Wednesday , 19 : 30 o &apos;clock .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA and there were many other teams that sent after his impressive open training day at the end of the last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some trainer could have been banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the Bank , as he lost a barley , as it did a man @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ league con@@ sign@@ it at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues his true face in the re@@ side cabin after the game .
instead of his Roo@@ kies to the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula is also publicly publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ er sport@@ scar Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne is also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ hey , who has forgotten him to forget his pat@@ rons , and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ist at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnes@@ ota .
it was certainly not the start to the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian Ge@@ ar for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the game field , and told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a start in his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was a thing that comes now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne has led the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

Ab@@ gel@@ eh@@ ouse asylum seek@@ ers want the Free v@@ oters as fast as possible .

the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ized that several federal states are not consistently consistently : &quot; we know nation@@ wide standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria doesn &apos;t come from , others not . &quot;

but the country &apos;s policy should not fall under the table .
a lon@@ gevity of long term remains on the agenda : the image policy .

for easy , important di@@ abe@@ tics can be helpful weight surgery .
the advantages of the weight loss surgery for lightweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ lap people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery that wrote a Editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A .
weight loss or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the magnets .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability , food .
over the years , obes@@ ity operations used for treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies were carried out with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fat .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study used the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that has been collected in a study and compare two types of obes@@ ity Surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ypass and gast@@ ric treatments - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes with people who were easy to be important .
the average BMI under which the operation fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who remained non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments , approximately equal to 29 .
among those who refused to undergo a surgical procedure , with 36 % diabetes disease completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , the diabetes complete only with a per cent and partially only about two percent .
in addition , the results were in the controls of the blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also present the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood values in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is held at the best under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but these better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you are reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced the ster@@ ility in five years , so the executive researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also have average results with two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , reached greater return to the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ lap of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
during the new study , there is no survival part of the surgery after five years , there is a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obes@@ ity of obes@@ ity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it is soothing for persons with a BMI under 35 that are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because they say that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait for long until we bring people to take this seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that soon as they have seen these genetic changes that have been linked to their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible to come to Europe , &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot take all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee camp in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama said to the beginning of his ten days visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he called that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity will be placed in the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries have ad@@ mired the refugee camp , but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama Germany and Austria efforts in the crisis of the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution .
&quot; around several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like a real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries can be created . &quot;
ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems . &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented on the terrorist attacks of September 11 and set out that the violent reaction of the US had a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September I expressed my side in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to the solution of this problem is in violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good but he sat in violence , and that has unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four times increase by slopes of slopes inf@@ ant by children in last 4 years
tox@@ ins centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which is strongly alcoholic drinks , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand @-@ inf@@ ant in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ins centres report , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are always more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink , while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or for a mut@@ sample for social media .
show videos on YouTube , like young disinf@@ ect@@ ant only drink because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have been mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be crushed by attractive nozzle of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ cels .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berry , wine trau@@ ma and orange du@@ ft , which are very promising for children .
slopes contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
especially with small children , a few sy@@ zer can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the tox@@ ins Center in the Hospital of Kansas , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not leave any gor@@ ck whis@@ ky in reach of children , and if children come from children , then it is a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year old girl , which was recently taken four sy@@ zer by stra@@ w@@ berry du@@ cks in the school , was taken into a notation for the treatment .
your blood alcoholic concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is drunk at an adult law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said , she said in G@@ tiny Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go , when she came to the emergency .
doctors taught them over night in a separate children &apos;s house on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol , he said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use alcoholic free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant products outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ant were connected to death .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the gor@@ ges of slopes inf@@ ant , which contain a toxic , not de@@ fied ingredient .
staff of health authorities , that the product meth@@ anol contained a fatal solution , instead of ethylene alcohol , which has been recorded as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in New York , their &quot; teacher too pois@@ oned by means of anti@@ bacterial products around the teaching area , &quot; so it is a police report .

why I will be witness of an executive board in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it will not be happening in an audience gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p will sit down by the tox@@ t@@ injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was first mentioned for the first time in January about his best friend , and even though I was sho@@ cked .
when the day is closer , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can be seen in the USA , and there are often more applications than places to decide who will choose who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media courts from 12 to five .
who is selected , who will observe it emotional .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a not@@ ebooks and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me to give me on Twitter , my ignor@@ ance .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoners , as he wants , and you will receive access .
I have taken me with her .
they thought that they could have better form@@ ulate , &quot; but they always think that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of things which I have said and written .
he does not say what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants to present an international repor@@ ter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a replica of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Podcasts , which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go to all details here .
I cannot say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassin@@ ation of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a sense of fact .
but I think that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the mor@@ ality .
I think it is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die him .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ter to contact you .
what you will get from me , what it means to see a man a unnecessary death .
man according to feu@@ dal police @-@ persec@@ ute hunt , from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt to hang a man of Perth , the police was un@@ fortun@@ ate , when he was in the sil@@ ky and sum@@ p@@ ages of water , just a few meters from a police officers , who tried to talk to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peace event in pel@@ ken@@ ham .
when she discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he was not too far too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I will not come out , Come and hol , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his Uni@@ form , therefore , he turned a reliable tac@@ tic tac@@ tics - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
master@@ ing football player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Cou@@ sins went his car in the Gr@@ aben to go to a alcohol control and tried to swim over the Swan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to stop him , and threat@@ ens him to finish the racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tries to install a sp@@ ion in his st@@ äl@@ len and threat@@ ening the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integration of Racing Victoria and said that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing sport and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ fer@@ sample in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had kept 18 months due to the Sp@@ ion@@ age suburbs , and did not want to see that it &quot; see how too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say nothing to say , and I have done long , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes once again , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that it is far .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I have said .
I will go home in the evening and sleep well .
I want to go to the head , and I would like to think my owners that I try to try my best for them .
if they start to think , I do not do that I should not be more trainer .
I have to be able to do what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integration department had tried to record his stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will be asked to deliver information about what I do in my st@@ ables , &quot; says Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they really believe that I am a bed .
if this is the case , they should surely be able to touch their nests , because they have to be able to set me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of time and are still aware of time .
should I bring me that it will personally be personally ?
if the RV@@ L has celebrated themselves and makes people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think that I am .
maybe they have to take me my license , and I have no doubt that what I say that I will tell you now .
but I now arrived at the point , which is no matter , and that makes me sad .
this makes me really sad .
I will practise the pressure on them and put them to meet a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ str@@ ations of the train@@ ers have been built with the long @-@ long cob@@ alt examination in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching led that he said &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ question@@ er Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the racing car treatment rule , &quot; after a pack mud or tone on the horse had been applied to the horse .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to take over the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff has turned off the leg on the leg .
it would have been so evening .
it would have yesterday the whole day so that was so that was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three im@@ on@@ ati@@ fication dis@@ qualified for treatment with the package on the race day . a study of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who represent these rules , do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ los proposes to fight against Riv@@ al because of claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ i wrote criticism at the T@@ ack@@ ling of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told that the arbit@@ ration of the Storm players &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly ver@@ ed note to the Storm team , after his team had achieved the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game of a &quot; Mu@@ ster@@ y &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land was not &quot; to be good &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ ek did the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team , and said that they only be concentrated at T@@ ack@@ ling only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ ka added that the criticism of two leading trainer in his team is confident that they did not worry about the Storm team .
&quot; I always heard it again - I did not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson about Ring@@ competitions spoke to us 24 : 2 , &quot; he said Bell@@ ore on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our defective system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les to a real focus , and that has been the trend for us .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he has obvious a great team for three years . he is probably not used to lose it so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is already strange , as this is always up to this season .
Bell@@ los has been attacked by the &quot; exciting football &quot; attacked and his ment@@ or , remember that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ va won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; more boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he was compared to Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ i .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball@@ game that you want to play when one has this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so that they can play .
I build confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about us to play against us .
six weeks ago , they don &apos;t have thought to us than it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ i did also go to the game Storm against RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS a higher result , as the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not viewed yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there was two other attempts in our game , but is that a exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not make any points ?
there are the game plans for me .
if they mention us , it means that we will still meet in a phase .
the Storm team has free on this weekend as they have won the right to receive the North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at A@@ AM@@ I Park . the ticket sales starts from next service tomorrow .

during the Trial , he got the police on his residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and boots had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as safety , to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial loading , &quot; said Richter flan@@ agan .
but that alone is not enough to keep it , do not appear to appear .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was set up against a deposit , among the conditions that he takes his Australian and his Serbian pass , at the police day and his son pass , at the police day at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has been given an Ex @-@ prisoners of the Just@@ iz@@ ers of Te@@ gel , which was placed in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners had to be eligible for financial compensation if they are in small cells .
this was decided to published the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday .
the circumstances can even hope the judges even though , if they were locked only a few days in a tight spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was a Ex @-@ prisoners with its Constitutional will be successful in Karlsruhe and November 2009 : he was placed in a single cell with around five square meters floor area ; the toilet was spatial not separate .
after that the man was in a larger cell , then the man was moved to a larger cell .
his ministers due to the un@@ worthy conditions against the land of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Court lifted up the verdict of the Chamber Court of Berlin , and presented the case for a renewed test .
they see the human dignity of man .
chamber Court decides on the amount of compensation
even though from legal reasons for the compensation period only a few days of arrest warrant for the compensation . be an out@@ set was given , was called it .
otherwise , &quot; one of the legal protection of the personality would be fear . &quot;
the chamber Court has to clari@@ fy the height of the schol@@ ars .
the constitutional leaders have been strengthened in the past , often strengthened the rights of criminal .
so they said only in April a prisoner , because he was naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the majority of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had an prisoners in a parallel fall in November 2009 .
the dam@@ sel K@@ lä@@ ger was over three months every day between 15 to 21 hours in a same cell , as in the same case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also in the latest weeks because of missing staff in the Headlines .
prisoners will therefore be included in 23 hours , the aggres@@ sion of aggres@@ sion should be come , even because of the necessary situation .
after the exp@@ ulsion of the Just@@ in place , 21 positions are not occupied in Te@@ gel because of young people , 19 will fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is decided to take it .
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Ministry in this year , according to the statement of Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge , &quot; I say again and again : we can create , and we can create this . &quot;
what comes to Germany , the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the pest@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years long .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living room but mainly with paid rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social services from the rental price , and to apply this particularly cheap apartments .
the Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the view of the pest@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 soci@@ ations would have to invest every year and to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
scientists are scientists and Federal Minister of Minister that it has to give more control parts for investments in the housing building .
according to estimates of the Institute for labour market and vocational research , it is 55 percent of ge@@ aring in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany did not ask system@@ atically after their qualification to help them , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project man@@ ag@@ itation for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , however , whether they find in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation of social contacts , but also for self @-@ worth@@ iness of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ation for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has given a political turn : from the work offered for refugees to recognition of work .
while it was previously reduced to asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ est light , the asylum seek@@ ers are limited to a residential location .
in the society - even because of the trade fair , the visibility can be found that refugees should be faster faster to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient offer to general and most common language courses .
investigations also show that jobs are most common through personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore designed by Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the royal path to work .
the Berlin school administration has been found that only a few days spent her children in the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family with the advantages of the K@@ ita , spread the administration in different languages .
if necessary , the need to increase in refugees by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - about by using more expert schools .
in the countries , students are prepared without German knowledge in welcome .
they are not always taught by full teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , even by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ate from the Berlin school .
the German student plant is estimated that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
however , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was in Berlin , inside , Frank handle ( CDU ) has now abandoned its attitude .
study of refugees could be facilit@@ ated to the university .
for refugees with a residence or Dul@@ ce does not receive services according to asylum seek@@ ers . more , if they start a study .
the latter is generally not BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , as they fall not under the circle of b@@ af@@ ers .
Ged@@ ul@@ led refugees had to be eligible for four years in Germany to be BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G @-@ entitled to be shortened to 15 months from January 1 , 2016 .
however , this financial statements must be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German students .
students should be able to get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will play a most important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many is the religion important part of their identity .
the state should have the same rights of the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
this is important , the establishment of a Islamic sense , which is professional around the curiosity .
the right hand also belong to the right hand .
so the representatives of Islam have to be clear to clear contact with the state in many areas and with him certain control options .
this also belongs to the read@@ iness to go against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , made on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered according to Germany .
those who wanted to have such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have you right to stay here in Germany , in Germany , he said in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he smote the Basic Law on arab@@ ic .
integration will be much more than today a topic of all society .
this will also change the majority society , the dis@@ ruption of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be charged .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - since a cr@@ less decade , an antibiot@@ ic law and a General of equality law .
yet it is very slow , such as the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed , in the police and authorities to ignore the rapid motif system@@ atically .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and the interests of groups such as the anti@@ ra@@ is@@ mus@@ cul@@ inity Germany have to remain in the next few years , if the country must remain peaceful and its new citizens , and their new citizens are going to use .
in general , Germany is able to provide the previously expected refugees to provide medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities affects , we create the &quot; , he said to the day .
however , there are additional money into the system .
to avoid Eng@@ p@@ asses , calls for Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all incen@@ tives at registration health species .
services could be charged later with the federal states .
and long @-@ long @-@ term , it is highly frag@@ mented , so many people with the limited performance catalogue will see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , doctors make the doctors to create the language .
already so far , the Berlin health scientific studies of The@@ a Bor@@ de has been detected , migrants are more worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in physician would have to be taken over , they calls them .
in addition , many refugees would have been involved with more common medical procedures in the emergency out@@ ward .
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee camps , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the young people go around HIV .
with the partly other path@@ ways German doctors from their training , but clear , the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite &quot; paras@@ ite or tuber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and what the anger concerns the refugees even in sight .
the Syrians would have a highly developed image system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to practice practice , however , they do not have their qualification and make sure your qualification again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany is psych@@ ically sick after the estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ ace ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ic sick : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress or under depression .
refugee camps , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of the TU Munich is that each fifth Syrian refugee camps is trau@@ matic in Germany .
those who is due to a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress , is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac and death .
other symptoms are sleeping - and concentration disorders , strong sciss@@ ors and emotional pi@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms of chronic , the symptoms would be necessary , be Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of mental sick refugees have been a Psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically sick asylum seek@@ ers can set a application for a Psycho@@ therapy , but the processing usually lasts several months .
in addition , they would not be trained in social workers or doctors that are not trained for mental diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this is often lead to failure , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa oldest leaders , fell down at the beginning of the year by a podium the stairs down .
he remained un@@ fortun@@ ate , but the video of the Falls is spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament has also been abol@@ ished by claims of the opposition , that they were anonymous death of death , and they were warned to accompany the address given by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month , they had broken him , and brought him during his speech to the situation of the nation in Parliament . this is the speech which he was repeated on Tuesday .
the speaker of the Movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ sal @-@ politicians SMS messages have received their mobile phones that they had to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es An@@ language .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she told the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es .
they war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the imm@@ unity ends in Parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
the chief son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25.000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of re@@ structured and savings efforts to the services of the company .
in this year , HP is divided into two listed companies and the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job loss leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP in a declaration .
&quot; this re@@ structured measures will enable a competitive cost , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which shall lead the unity after the separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a wide and profound portfolio of shops who support companies at the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ yearly sales and &quot; will be focused on providing an integrated technology solutions for companies to be concentrated as a declaration of the company .
it is a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard was founded in order to produce electric plants and their Palo Alto garage , &quot; called the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ structured structure to connect the crash of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the latest in this area which is based on the convic@@ tion that is closely focused on a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere certainly does not miss at least the next four games for England and its history is certainly un@@ certain in the next summer at the European Championship .
the great shame at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere has ended the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ ling viol@@ ated again and then back to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury not threatened the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , which is not well healed .
this is no greater matter .
this was just a accident .
it was not in conjunction with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from purely medical view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the corresponding risk of other injuries , always when a player tried to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd is listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 by Arsen@@ as 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ing in the last five games hours .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ating , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the risk rate during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come from a violation of injury , you have to strengthen a time period , you have to strengthen your body and combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zed , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will be a career of the way that he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur at the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ o@@ Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , what does Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta start to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ on Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and players who need to make a small delay break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal clear favor@@ ites are to come through group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the game with the largest market effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ beaten after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by a earthquake on Tuesday , whereby the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has moved from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains of the fer@@ ries hope to lead the association with his management to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked with Arsenal .
we stayed in 2006 very close to the other side , but on the other side I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not pregnant .
Friend@@ ly Fest : the Com@@ edy Show , which is serious lessons concerning men of men .
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in regard to the need for men , now , as the need for men to open , like self @-@ m@@ ord@@ rates under a 15 @-@ year @-@ h@@ och .
in 2013 , it was the most important death cause of men in the age of 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there remains three times more common in men than women .
in the effort to go to the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ isk ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a p@@ oo@@ rest life ) 2015 as the year of the man to ask the culture in question that men need to search for help if they need these need .
friendship is the heart of the fight to avoid this challenge .
a current study at more than 2,000 High @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms presented that if the body had a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; had to be able to double its chances .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , half a circle of spiritual friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to work with a friendship .
in the age of over social media , communication , with its focus on style , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , life and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is given by the domin@@ ating what psych@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values , money , social status , all on costs in@@ tr@@ ine values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that works on our spiritual health .
and like a video game inventor and milli@@ ard@@ ants recently declared , money can &apos;t buy luck .
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by its personality by the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football gu@@ cks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that men came on every case , even if they are often able to explore their feelings .
like a staff of telephone , it declared me : ... &quot; my vocation for people who are de@@ pressed and sel@@ m@@ ord@@ ed are really clearly shown , how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us , often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ long @-@ long @-@ term prevention .
it presents very clearly the small moments of men of men .
so very my objective status status via the phone in the eye of desp@@ air can also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit our weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed setting , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference could make your friendship .

di Mary meets PS@@ G to help PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Sh@@ son Cav@@ ani according to his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Mary meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Kam@@ son Cav@@ ani thought course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain has held its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö on Tuesday .
di Mary met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French master on the way , but after that they had increased its lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , in the group A requires a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they are not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement in the fourth three campaigns in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an ha@@ him@@ ov@@ ics , it was later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with whom he began his own career in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 if there are certain things that we have to cause certain things that we have to do in the course of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .

the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday , however , was perfect against Minnes@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the Twin@@ s have a chance to climb to Ascension within a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word that was so difficult to touch over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; says Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support , as Detroit three times in the first two routes , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) smote 6 times in the 1 / 3 routes and made three rats .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw in the Bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated in the game .
the designed tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rats , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since then he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6 July .
&quot; he made it well , &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good out of the ( impact training ) , clearly looked better from the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ us at the end of the seventh inside the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the In@@ ning with a double on the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Link@@ sh@@ ine Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .

after Detroit at the end of the ninth way , the wall added a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loose of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and generated the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , S@@ ano near three Pit@@ ches for its fifth release .
Detroit benefited from a still not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers received three R@@ us in the first two routes against the right hand @-@ veter@@ an , which was painted before the game of the risk list , after having had more than one month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning , I told me , &quot; I said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt myself and felt that I would make some quite good Pit@@ ches in third parties . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , H@@ ank gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the average &quot; at the first Run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z gave his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the lap in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single run on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third .
the Tig@@ ers laid one one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he is not very good , but he did not know the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was found in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , did not have points in the third In@@ ning before he was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver .

on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now called &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the name was carried out by the labour community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , parish of Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remember that the protest in the city of the Ponti@@ f@@ est over centuries often could live as a minority .
the place will be visible in symbolic way that their tradition is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a young August@@ ine for the year 15@@ 10 / 11 some months in Rome .
he received the city then as a commented sin .
his negative impressions will present him to view from history in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had moved with his Th@@ ese against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ del the split of the ab@@ yss Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main stations that painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and Bible lyrics .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has a very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and screen .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and matches forms the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is not equal to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective topics can be adjusted .
around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
there are cycles , the themes like crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ather@@ less .
in addition , he has fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is all the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , which has set up on the basis of painting with the respective Bible .
he was interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible and so in today , &quot; translated into current inter@@ iors . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded in the original Bible between Martin Luther and each set of the artist that formulated its very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry band has golden Let@@ ers .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately born at all the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order .
&quot; the education already happened with the pipe , &quot; reminds Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; I tried to work that you may also carry me again with the Lord . &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in a faster time again : &quot; the perception of educational is characterised by Advert@@ ise , and that is loud .
Sym@@ bo@@ lik is going out there .
artists have a different desire and w@@ onne to show things .
images always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to make the viewer into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post gest@@ ed on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; ever &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art had been to be : &quot; I like with his pictures . &quot;
old have not been able to capture the Bible complete , but also for him important , even mysterious topics .
&quot; that was no cooperation on eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it goes to the pictures , the text explained only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes are final on a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group game of Europe League .
the National player will also be missing in Du@@ ell with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 clock / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot go back on him , &quot; he said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday .
if R@@ EU@@ s will be open on Sunday at the Bundesliga Top@@ play against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ B Coach open : &quot; we expect to return to the workout on Friday . &quot;
with the high load of his pros , Tu@@ chel will not change its stem eleven on the R@@ EU@@ s position .
thus he announced a change on the cake position .
this is why the novel Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place in the square of the novel Roman brushes .
&quot; he trained on a absolute top level , &quot; lob@@ ster of the football teacher .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europe @-@ League games , but Tu@@ chel is open .
with high probability he will also be the second game .
the for@@ warding statement of Mit@@ player R@@ EU@@ s , that the Fin@@ als will be the goal for the Bv@@ B in Europe League the goal is to be fully wrong : &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins which look forward thanks to video projector .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French design , which was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits in the large star of the Mo@@ des@@ scene - and so that he had men in tubes .
&quot; I cannot say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier , it was very easy , now it &apos;s real , &quot; he said .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From Citi@@ zens ) , which is a happiness that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ ters is a happiness that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ ters has changed his first time over his person .
actually he had been in contrast , because : &quot; for me a bit after death , &quot; he said .
when one dies , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
go to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits will hardly give an insight into the man &apos;s work &apos;s work , the fashion history has written without ever a training .
chron@@ ologically is the show not built , but it is a superb chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall , for which much effort was operated for the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist was engaged .
14 tons of material used the M@@ acher according to the curator of Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October , there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather cover outfit with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sch@@ lau@@ er as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different .
An@@ ti@@ ers old te@@ ddy is also seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ul@@ ls of the design .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poor in the football ) he found his te@@ ddy B@@ HS and Dresses .
to play with a doll , his parents would not allowed him .
after that mode he had brought himself into himself .
he steel modems and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought the then of course .
for his first own fashion show , he cannot pay the models .
they were nothing but they were able to keep the cl@@ am@@ ots .
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ strian tip as fashion niche
earlier , it went to the long embroi@@ dered machines in and around Pl@@ auen , meters .
the best substances and tips formed in large amount for customers that they worked for example , ceilings and Gard@@ ines .
this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ vers Pl@@ auen .
instead , the fashion is important .
in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ strian tip , fashion played a larger role , then re@@ plen@@ ish through the home tex@@ tual industry . it is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional tra@@ ys .
at all bil@@ de the so @-@ called vintage mode , which re@@ jects an increasing effect , an increasing the contrac@@ tor .
those who are not operated in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available on the market .
with us they are already half of all orders .
Mo@@ sters Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ strian tip and Sti@@ cker .
only they may carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales are broken .
private trade and wholesale is almost no longer .
our products can hardly reach our customers on this way .
the mass ware will be produced in the Asian room much cheaper and almost exclusively on chains .
in addition , the export of export to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry is also tried by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from nitrogen per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we lead a quality sie@@ ve that we produce ecological and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supple@@ mented : &quot; this also refers to the used materials . &quot;
diplom@@ acy U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Snow College of the West Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts and is specialized on Sti@@ cker and tips .
in order to find the competition from the Asian room , one must find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
it is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the bed , which have to think especially economical , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design is often only slightly varies to keep a customer st@@ amm .
in front of some years of animated text Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic sn@@ eb@@ ox new .
st@@ ems the machine on some places small kitchen .
the Pl@@ au@@ dien@@ ces in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ds left herself : &quot; before I could not start with traditional pl@@ ums . &quot;
now she uses the sn@@ eb@@ all@@ tip for their jewelry .
in a small procedure they put the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ dien@@ ces - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies in the USA , according to Australia and Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings .
so I see my jewelry as modern ambassador of Pl@@ au@@ dien@@ ces .
