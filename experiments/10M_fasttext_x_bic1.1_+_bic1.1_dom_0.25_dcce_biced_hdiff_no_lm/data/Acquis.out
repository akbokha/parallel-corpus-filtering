a reag@@ ent for blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen , the anti@@ body or another on the label specified substance hom@@ ol@@ og .
a reag@@ ent in which is used by the manufacturer is used , thus the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) h@@ รคm@@ ol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the T@@ iter is measured through the increasingly being di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent reag@@ ents to the double in a suitable medium .
the T@@ iter is the value of the number of strongest power di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the dil@@ lution is calculated only by the volume of blood @-@ floo@@ ding in the overall volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ laws or other reag@@ ents that are supposed to be used on object carriers , the activity is required for a ag@@ glut@@ ination to an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established the International Standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ EU reag@@ ents for the blood @-@ group regulation of international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specif@@ icity , and for the time standards .
a international standard prepar@@ atory system contains a certain number of Internation@@ aler units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ ans who are observed in individual preparations ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for the blood @-@ group determination of most specif@@ icity is expressed as Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ st@@ iter , which is observed in a series of thin in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding .
the T@@ iter gives the dil@@ lution of the reag@@ ents in the last mix within a series , where a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effic@@ acy of reag@@ ents for blood group determination , available for the international standard prepar@@ atory system ( for the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the un@@ identified Re@@ agents in international units ( see Bulletin WHO 2002 , 10 , 937 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .
if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B ser@@ ene contain a definition of 256 international units per ml .
the preparation are available free of charge of the International Labor@@ atorium for biological standards of the World Health Organisation , Stat@@ ens Serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative tit@@ ration of the International standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an unknown &quot; anti @-@ A Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PIC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
a reag@@ ent among the manufacturers suggested by the manufacturer will remain stored , so its needed properties will remain long for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent form in c@@ essi@@ v@@ ely form according to label is at most one year after the last content of activity .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ reag@@ ents has been gover@@ ned by the re@@ sign@@ ation of the re@@ stra@@ int ; it is approved by the state level of regul@@ atory approvals .
dried reag@@ ents are kept in a atmosphere of in@@ iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum that they have been dried in the glass container where it is closed , that no humidity can penet@@ rate .
a dry re@@ productive may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is due to further drying of phosph@@ or@@ pen@@ to@@ xy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacter@@ ial growth , the competent state authority may be added that the reag@@ ent ( or the reag@@ ent methods supplied ) is an anti @-@ ep@@ tic and / or anti@@ bi@@ otic to determine the requirements for specif@@ icity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml c@@ ursed or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um .
the reag@@ ents , same as if in c@@ essi@@ v@@ ely form or after the re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may not contain Se@@ di@@ ments nor joints or visible particles .
for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for the exchange of blood @-@ determination , should not be coloured , at least as long as long as long as it has come over a uniform system .
reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination are in such way and divide in such quantities not only for performing tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity required in a container must be so big that the content may be used to carry out the effectiveness of the effic@@ acy test in this protocol .
the manufacturing labor@@ ator@@ io has all output stages and controls of reag@@ ents for blood type @-@ determination written written notes .
reasonable samples of all publ@@ ishers are to keep long from the laboratory in keeping with some lik@@ el@@ i@@ hood , that the batch can &apos;t be used anymore .
the reag@@ ents used to the blood type can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these are the necessary tools for rein@@ forcement and maint@@ aining the stability and maint@@ aining stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided according to the origin of their effective application in three groups .
this means that the reag@@ ents of human origin do not contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ acts are not included in any substances of human origin .
on each single container a black printed label is printed in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , with dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the required liquid needed ,
also , this label or the label on the cardboard box , in which the container contain instructions , or the containers added : 1 full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . quantity or , when dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the required liquid needed ,
each show is to contri@@ bute a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention in accordance with the Annex to this protocol .

some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on object carriers also are hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are weak@@ ened in their own ser@@ um or plasma .
the following requirements to determine the effic@@ acy of Ser@@ a for the determination of the R@@ h group may be am@@ es@@ e. i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) blood gru@@ ppen@@ ery ( human )
anti @-@ D Serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immune by the An@@ tigen D of the R@@ h System .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not containing human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a guide of at least 1 : 32 compared to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cooked sal@@ ine solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the un@@ solved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard pre@@ par@@ ate of in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or similar pattern of blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um is expected to include blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended to be used for the use of object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , after that they have mixed a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination with equal amount of 40 - to 50@@ percent , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C Serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people that are immune by the Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h System .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human blood cells that contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specify for the C an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells are weak@@ ened in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cooked sal@@ ine solution .
the T@@ iter of Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ cd@@ dee blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) have to be mixed with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent of slightly visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ e ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immune by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h System .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a guide of at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ cd@@ d@@ E@@ e blood cells .

when anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on an object holder with a same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent flo@@ ods , the Ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur at any flo@@ ods within the double @-@ sol@@ uble , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard pre@@ ference of anti @-@ A blood gru@@ ppen@@ ery or a standard con@@ current equal A@@ vi@@ d@@ ity is carried out .
anti @-@ B Serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immune by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
anti @-@ B ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the B @-@ an@@ tigen , that he@@ e@@ ats those of the blood cells B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated any human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , that e@@ ats those of blood cells 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is in parallel to the rec@@ ur@@ red , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard part of the anti @-@ B blood group or a compar@@ ative blood circulation , with a floo@@ ding of blood cells in group B .
if Anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object holder with a same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells , so the Ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within the well @-@ solved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard part of the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard pre@@ par@@ ate equal A@@ vi@@ d@@ ity .
