<seg id="1418">The Titer is measured through the increasingly being dilution of the reagent reagents to the double in a suitable medium.</seg>
<seg id="1419">The Titer is the value of the number of strongest power dilution in which a reaction occurs; the dillution is calculated only by the volume of blood-flooding in the overall volume.</seg>

<seg id="1422">A international standard preparatory system contains a certain number of Internationaler units per mg or ml, and this definition is independent of the Titans who are observed in individual preparations (1).</seg>
<seg id="1423">(1) The effectiveness of reagents for the blood-group determination of most specificity is expressed as Agglutinationstiter, which is observed in a series of thin in a erythrocyte flooding.</seg>
<seg id="1424">The Titer gives the dillution of the reagents in the last mix within a series, where a microscopic visible agglutination occurs.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The efficacy of reagents for blood group determination, available for the international standard preparatory system (for the time Anti-A and Anti-B as well as incomplete Anti-D), can be expressed on the basis of the unidentified Reagents in international units (see Bulletin WHO 2002, 10, 937, 941 - 1950, 3, 301).</seg>
