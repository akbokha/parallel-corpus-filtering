it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets which dis@@ solve in the mouth ) as a solution to incl@@ usion ( 1@@ mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Cre@@ ate thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things that are not available ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bipolar I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , a psych@@ ic dis@@ order in which patients def@@ ind@@ ed with periods of normal atmosphere .
Ab@@ il@@ ify is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and for prevention of Japanese ep@@ iso@@ des in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is applied to fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al dis@@ orders when the oral in@@ gest@@ ion is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to incl@@ usion or melting of patients , which make the sw@@ allowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are taking other medicines that same as Ab@@ il@@ ify should be extrac@@ ted , the dose of ab@@ il@@ ify should be adjusted .
this im@@ paired the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical agents that allow the communication of ner@@ ve cells each other .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol is believed primarily as &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine can play a role in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and b@@ ipolar distur@@ b@@ ance to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which means psychological or man@@ ic symptoms and prev@@ ented them .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ il@@ ify that prevent re@@ occurr@@ ence of symptoms was investig@@ ated in three studies of up to one year .
the effic@@ acy of injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases , which was compared to increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , Ab@@ il@@ ify was reported about twelve weeks in 347 patients with Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol , in another study the effic@@ acy of Ab@@ il@@ ify and plac@@ ebo , which were stabil@@ ised to 160 patients with whom the symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with Ab@@ il@@ ify .
the effic@@ acy of Ab@@ il@@ ify In@@ jection solution was found in a study of 301 patients with b@@ ipolar distur@@ b@@ ance that were increased to increased un@@ rest , with the Lor@@ a@@ zep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients achieved using a standard scale for b@@ ipolar dis@@ order or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also led studies to investig@@ ate how the body takes the melting , and absor@@ b the solution to absor@@ b absor@@ b .
in the two studies with the injection solution of patients , Ab@@ il@@ ify in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg got a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in use for the treatment of b@@ ipolar dis@@ order , Ab@@ il@@ ify was executed in four of five short term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more than plac@@ ebo .
Ab@@ il@@ ify pre@@ vent@@ or until 74 weeks was more effective than plac@@ ebo @-@ occurr@@ ing Japanese ep@@ iso@@ des before previously treated patients and if it was admin@@ istered to an existing treatment .
Ab@@ il@@ ify in@@ jec@@ tions in 10- or 15 @-@ mg doses had also reduced effective than plac@@ ebo and were similar effective as a plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Ab@@ il@@ ify for inser@@ tion ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal distur@@ b@@ ances ( inf@@ lic@@ ation ) , tre@@ mor and exhau@@ st@@ ion ( increased sal@@ ine production ) , blood pressure and exhau@@ st@@ ion , ru@@ th@@ iness ( sleep changes ) and anx@@ i@@ ety ( sleep changes ) and anx@@ i@@ ety .
the Committee on Human@@ medic@@ inal products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Ab@@ il@@ ify in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des in patients who had pre@@ domin@@ antly man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des on the treatment with A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ io , vers@@ us the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al dis@@ orders in patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with man@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with man@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , if an or@@ ale therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the European Commission of Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. to submit Ab@@ il@@ ify to the entire European Union .
ABI@@ LITY is indicated for the treatment of moderate ep@@ iso@@ des of the Bipolar @-@ I@@ - St@@ ations and for the prevention of a new ep@@ is@@ ode of patients who had pre@@ domin@@ antly man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des on the treatment with A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LITY is 10 or 15 mg / day for a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
increased effic@@ acy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proved , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LITY is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
ABI@@ LITY OF ABI@@ LITY in treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and Bipolar @-@ I@@ - Dis@@ order in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
consider@@ ation of the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initi@@ al@@ ion when clinical factors can just@@ ify this just@@ ification ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor consists of combination therapy , the A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective dis@@ orders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an anti@@ mental therapy , even in treatment with A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with b@@ ipolar distur@@ b@@ ance no increased su@@ ici@@ ality of risk is caused by means of anti @-@ anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics compared with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ov@@ ascular diseases , cardi@@ ov@@ ascular diseases , hyp@@ ovol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure medic@@ inal products ) or hyper@@ tension ( including packages and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that were a year or less digest@@ ed , there were occas@@ ional reports about the treatment with A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol induc@@ ed dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie .
if with ABI@@ LITY patients treated signs and symptoms of Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie should occur , the dose should reduce or interru@@ pt the treatment .
if a patient is developing and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns cle@@ ver , or un@@ clear high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical manif@@ estation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be removed including ABI@@ LITY .
therefore , in patients with anti @-@ fan@@ ati@@ zation , it should be used in the medical history or near the conditions that are used with caution .
56 - 99 years of patients with psych@@ osis associated with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients who were treated with the Alzheimer &apos;s disease , an increased risk is compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of those studies , a study of fixed doses , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted d@@ rov@@ ascular events observed with A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases , associated with k@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic treatments , including ABI@@ LITY .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic data related un@@ wanted events with ABI@@ LITY and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic treatments treated patients who allow direct de@@ pression .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ phen@@ y , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weak@@ ness ) are observed in patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be observed regularly in terms of deter@@ i@@ ety of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ ed patients and in patients with b@@ ip@@ olar@@ ity , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight gain is observed as a side effect , and could lead to serious complic@@ ations .
due to the primary effect of A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole on the central ner@@ vous system , caution is advis@@ able when A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines referred to as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D6 inhib@@ itor ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P2@@ D6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose can be performed .
when CY@@ P2@@ D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ ism can result in a high @-@ effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma cutting of A@@ ID D6 exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you take into consider@@ ation the common G@@ abe of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors , the potential benefits should exceed the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV protein @-@ inhib@@ itors , must have similar effects and therefore should be similar dos@@ ages .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors the dosage of ABI@@ LITY should be stim@@ ulated to the dose level before beginning of accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D6 together with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be admin@@ istered with a moderate increase in the C@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg are non @-@ significant effect on met@@ abol@@ ism of the subst@@ rates of CY@@ P2@@ D6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ am@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ mor@@ ph@@ in@@ an @-@ Ratio ) , 2C@@ 19 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ a ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ am@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patient should be smo@@ other to draw their doctor if she are pregnant or trying to plan a pregnancy during the treatment of A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole .
due to the in@@ sufficient data situation in the animal , this medicine may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless you can just@@ ify the potential risk for fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics the patients should be war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole has no negative influence .
the following side effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) :
the inc@@ idence of listed side effects are defined according to the following criteria : commonly ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occas@@ ionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled cross @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients with A@@ ID In@@ z@@ id@@ enz ( 25.@@ 8 % ) , including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie were treated , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol ( 5@@ 7,3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the inc@@ idence of EPS 19 % was under plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the inc@@ idence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients suffering from C@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
interim ep@@ iso@@ des of Bipolar I @-@ St@@ acy - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the inc@@ idence of EPS @-@ 23@@ ,5 % for patients under A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under sem@@ id@@ ol treatment .
in another study of more than 12 weeks , the inc@@ idence of EPS reached 26,@@ 6 % in patients under A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol @-@ treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inc@@ idence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potenti@@ ally significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were occurred , yiel@@ ded no significant differences .
increases the C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally well @-@ tempor@@ arily and asym@@ pt@@ omatic , were observed in 3,5 % of patients treated with ast@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol treated patients , compared to 2.0 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in connection with anti @-@ psychological therapy , mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , ins@@ om@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie and cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ acc@@ idents , invol@@ un@@ wanted d@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in el@@ derly people , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , acc@@ id@@ ental or deli@@ ber@@ ate over@@ dose with ag@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ io have been observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg , and without death sequence .
although no information about the effectiveness of a det@@ ec@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole ; it is un@@ likely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis occur in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , since A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole has a high plasma cutting .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ io in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and Bipolar @-@ I inter@@ ference above the combination of a partial ag@@ ist effect on Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ ist effect is medi@@ ated on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , the prec@@ ip@@ ot@@ om@@ in@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to d@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recept@@ or and the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ dering and for Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
in addition of A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks at healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ ed decrease in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recipe , at Nu@@ CL@@ EUS cau@@ dat@@ us and on the tur@@ no@@ ons .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled course studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in a positive or negative symptoms in comparison to plac@@ ebo showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of the mental symptoms .
in a sem@@ id@@ ol controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of Respon@@ sible patients received a response to the study medication that were similar in both groups ( C@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring range defined as secondary education programs , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - De@@ pression @-@ scale , showed an significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed an significantly higher reduction in return rate that was at 34 % in the A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol group and at 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational double @-@ blind study was included in line with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia in line with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evaluation level ) in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a man@@ ic or mixed ep@@ is@@ ode of the Bipolar @-@ I @-@ St@@ acy showed an anti@@ ebo @-@ superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed ep@@ is@@ ode of the Bipolar @-@ I inter@@ ference in case of plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed ep@@ is@@ ode of Bipolar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without mental characteristics , showed comparable effectiveness in week 3 and an accounting effect that was comparable to lithium or sem@@ id@@ ol in week 12 .
in addition , A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ol showed a compar@@ ative proportion of patients with sympt@@ omatic re@@ mission of the mania on such as lithium or sem@@ id@@ ol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks in patients with chronic or mixed ep@@ is@@ ep@@ is@@ ode , with or without psychological characteristics , which invol@@ ves more than 2 weeks not on lith@@ ic and val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy , which invol@@ ve partial effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .

in A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female subjects , also showed no sex@@ ually dependent effects in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination .
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no evidence on clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to eth@@ n@@ ical eth@@ ics or the influence of the smoking in the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kid@@ ney disease compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pug@@ li@@ ances class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the im@@ pair@@ ment of liver function on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ A@@ rip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw concl@@ usions on their met@@ abolic capacity .

the effic@@ acy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , in the 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were earlier a Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the drug pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other pharmac@@ euticals for reducing the side effects ) .
overall , 229 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it is considered only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metast@@ atic breast cancer , as far as to deter@@ i@@ ety of the disease and survival no difference between the drugs .
in contrast , in patients who had received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer , refer@@ ring to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also be applied in patients , bre@@ ast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low be@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ips in the blood .
the medicine committee for human medic@@ inal products ( CH@@ MP ) discovered that the first treatment was no more likely to be more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , in contrast to other medicines referred to as other drugs , to reduce ad@@ verse events .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Bios@@ c@@ ience Limited as a permit for the Transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer , in which the first line treatment of metast@@ atic disease is missing and is not indicated for a standard Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in @-@ contained therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pe@@ e ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ Philipp@@ ine count &lt; 0.50 by 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sen@@ sor@@ ial neuro@@ path@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in case of sens@@ ory Neuro@@ path@@ y degree 3 the treatment is interru@@ pted , until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and all subsequent cycles must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with mild to moderate im@@ pair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no trials involving patients with im@@ paired ren@@ al function and there are currently no sufficient data for recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with im@@ pair@@ ment of kid@@ ney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data to preserve and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ ate form@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and treated a distinc@@ tive treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients , there should be no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cy@@ c@@ lic , until the New Testament count increased again to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ elets are back to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with heavy liver dys@@ function ( bil@@ ir@@ u@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / ALT &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while am@@ big@@ uous ver@@ oto@@ x@@ icity in relation to the cardi@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , the inc@@ idence of cardi@@ ac patients aren &apos;t unusual , especially in patients with ear@@ ring Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in treatment or under@@ lying heart or lung disease .
in case of suffering from Abraham x@@ ane acts of n@@ au@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ e@@ tics and const@@ ip@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied for pregnant or in women , who do not pract@@ ising an effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in the aged period should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive metho@@ de .
Male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is stim@@ ulated , during and up to six months after the treatment is no child .
Male patients should be advised before treatment with a lock cl@@ oning , because through the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility is an ir@@ rever@@ sible infer@@ t@@ ility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machines .
below are the most common and most important inc@@ idents listed in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer that were treated in the piv@@ ot@@ al clinical Phase III study all three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most obvious important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was rapidly dependent ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients and was in three cases mostly ( h@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects are listed in connection with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy of any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occas@@ ionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occas@@ ionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased liqu@@ or hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced pot@@ assium in blood , reduced blood flow :

Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ idal effects 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity will be calculated based on a defin@@ ite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no effect with that events .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a An@@ tim@@ ic@@ rot@@ ub@@ bul@@ i @-@ active ingre@@ dient , which promotes assem@@ bling of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ bul@@ ence and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhib@@ ition of its polymer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to an inhib@@ ition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for vit@@ real inter@@ phase and unique cell@@ ular functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in was medi@@ ated by the tran@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components within the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in has been promoted by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial transport is transmitted by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zept@@ or and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in C@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ ind@@ ed indi@@ gen@@ ous studies and in 454 patients who were treated in a Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in an inf@@ usion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 used as an inf@@ usion of about 30 minutes in 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
this multi@@ core study was carried out in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medi@@ ation of a allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute Inf@@ usion without Pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
when the study included in the study 64 % of patients had a det@@ ective public state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ ers .
14 % of patients had previously still no chemotherapy , 27 % had only an ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for general response rates and time to progres@@ sion of disease and progres@@ sion @-@ free survival and survival for people who received &gt; First @-@ Line therapy , are described below .
ne@@ ur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity towards Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the enhancement to a degree of patients who were evaluated at a time during therapy a peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y degree 3 survived .
the natural history of peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y to sound on bas@@ eline based on bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 therapy courses were not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Total @-@ Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 @-@ 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the active ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early by 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 A intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of the Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 used the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration in multi@@ ph@@ as@@ ical manner .
the medium distribution volume came to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high volume of distribution points has a wide range of ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cul@@ atory distribution and / or turn@@ out connection of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with 20 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ uble pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the cle@@ ar@@ isation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher than the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ G@@ abe higher ( 43 % ) as after a sol@@ uble content of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ injection , and also the distribution volume was higher than Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver mic@@ ros@@ es and t@@ issues , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is reported primarily to met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary sur@@ geon was reduced by 4 % of the given total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
however , only few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in front of light light over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingre@@ dient ( also called &quot; Reference He@@ im@@ ant &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood levels that could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ f@@ usion complic@@ ations , in case prior to the procedure , a blood flow from 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected .
treatment with se@@ di@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor which has experience in tre@@ ating patients with ill@@ nesses , which is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kid@@ ney problems and in patients who wish to make a self @-@ ble@@ eding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ jected to a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be made by the patient or by the care person , if they have received proper instruction .
in patients with chronic kid@@ ney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per pallet with adults and between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be used prior to treatment to ensure that no iron defects should be given during the entire treatment .

Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to injection than injection in a v@@ ene in the framework of a major study of 479 patients who caused by kid@@ ney problems , compared to the im@@ pair@@ ment .
all patients participating in this study were in@@ jected at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , before they were either turned to se@@ amed or to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indi@@ gn@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also provided the results of a trial in which the effects of under the skin was produced under the skin , with that of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who were chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who were caused by kid@@ ney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es were obtained from patients who were forced to se@@ amed in the same degree as in those patients who continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison to the patients , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.@@ 06@@ 3 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase of blood pressure , occas@@ ionally to symptoms of en@@ ze@@ ph@@ al@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sud@@ den , qu@@ ay mig@@ rates and conf@@ identi@@ ality can result .
Ab@@ se@@ amed can not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epoxy in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as in@@ jec@@ tions under the skin is not recommended for treatment of kid@@ ney problems , as other studies are required to make sure that this by no allergic reactions are trig@@ gered .
the Committee on Human@@ medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union of proof , the medicine was a comparable quality , safety and effic@@ acy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

the second study included Two 127 men and women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , who had been a h@@ ips of frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures had been examined over a period of up to five years .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies of 357 patients and was compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
main indi@@ gn@@ ator for effic@@ acy was , if the sal@@ ary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( a enz@@ y@@ me is un@@ used ) in the blood again standardi@@ zed or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ te@@ br@@ frac@@ tures was reduced in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ans ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ e@@ mac@@ a ) with those under plac@@ ebo was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a freight t@@ inc@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components .

first and multiple 5 @-@ 15 minutes @-@ time inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ im@@ etic data which is proven to be dos@@ ed independently .
the plasma level quickly decreased from &lt; 10 % of the highest value to 4 h , and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the highest value .
R@@ asch@@ es bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ian dis@@ appearance of the large circulation of half @-@ life of ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ x 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ ale elim@@ ination period t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above 2 ½ -@@ values ) would probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion about kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the admin@@ istered dose can be found in ur@@ ine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded on bone tissue .
the total body clearance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decline of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration after 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma cent@@ ric against time ) .
a reduced Cle@@ arance by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ enz@@ y@@ me met@@ abolic substances is un@@ likely to met@@ abo@@ liz@@ ed because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is not met@@ abo@@ liz@@ ed because of a weak or even more direct and / or ir@@ rever@@ si@@ bler , met@@ abolic inhib@@ itor of P@@ 450@@ -
for special patient working groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Cle@@ arance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Cle@@ arance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine Cle@@ arance and was in the 64 investig@@ ated patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it emerg@@ es that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kid@@ ney function up to 35 ml / min are no dose custom@@ iz@@ able of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
as for severe kid@@ ney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Cle@@ arance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only con@@ stra@@ ined data are only possible for this population .
tox@@ icity is the highest non @-@ let@@ al intra@@ ven@@ ous dose was at mice 10 mg / kg body weight and 0,6 mg / kg body weight at rats .
in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the EY@@ C absor@@ bs the 6@@ fold of the recommended Human @-@ therap@@ eutic ex@@ position ) , admin@@ istered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application was admin@@ istered in 3 @-@ day inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the four@@ fold of the Human @-@ therap@@ eutic exposure , which corresponds to the four@@ fold of the Human @-@ therap@@ eutic execution , related to the AU@@ C , corresponding to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated ex@@ positions that the maximum of the intended human @-@ exposure limit , the maximum of the intended human @-@ exposure showed , the tox@@ ic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract and the liver , as well as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ jec@@ tions .
the most common report in studies with repeated application was a multip@@ lic@@ ted primary sp@@ ong@@ i@@ osa in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a report which reflec@@ ts the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of substance .
in rats there observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg than external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a sk@@ el@@ eton .

the following table ( table 1 ) shows the effects of un@@ wanted effects in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients who were treated to weight reduction and because of accompanying met@@ abolic diseases .
it was statist@@ ically significant higher than the in@@ spir@@ ing plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or when they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG in the evaluation of side effects , the following main options are covered :

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Legal Not@@ ification ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the studies will be ass@@ essed as the Committee on Human@@ medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos will be applied to treatment of type 2 diabetes ( non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent patients ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight @-@ dependent patients ) , where Met@@ form@@ in ( a Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ) can be applied , and it can be used together with another Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( dual therapy ) .
in addition , it can be applied to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) that cannot be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fa drugs or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fa drugs can be maintained , except for patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ fa drugs may be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be enhanced better and the blood sugar levels decre@@ ases , which means that type 2 diabetes is better .
for more than 1 400 patients the effic@@ acy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy has been studied ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa sl@@ ump , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo .
in studies , concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows you to reduce blood glucose levels when using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ ment study , the effect of the added treatment of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fa assets increased by 0,@@ 94 % , while the addition of plac@@ ebo was decre@@ asing by 0.35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin had been studied in 289 patients , proved to ins@@ ulin in@@ ulin , a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 12 % in the patients who were additionally plac@@ ebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ b@@ ances , inf@@ ections of the upper re@@ spir@@ atory tract , weight gain and hyp@@ o@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to mil@@ itia ) .
Ac@@ tos can be applied or used in patients , perhaps hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , in case of patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ osis ( high glucose levels - in blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( with all use ) is to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients with which Met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the approval of the European Commission , Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited covering approval of accounts in the EU &apos;s entire European Union .
the tablets are white to wh@@ it@@ ish , round , curved and carry on a page the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the label &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in which metals is in@@ adequate , as due to contrac@@ tion or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients that caused by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. at the ear@@ liest heart attack or sympt@@ omatic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin to increase the treatment with the lowest rate of available dose and increase the dose stages .
patients should be observed in symptoms and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or ey@@ ards , especially those with reduced bar@@ gain reserve .
the patients should be seen on signs and symptoms of in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and oils , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ ov@@ ascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing mac@@ ro@@ as@@ cul@@ ular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output levels ( ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used for Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
when the ALT @-@ ror has been increased to the 3 times of the upper limit of the norm , the liver enz@@ ym@@ es are as soon as possible .
if a patient has developed specifically to prove the dys@@ function , v@@ om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting , fatigue , app@@ et@@ ite , app@@ et@@ ite , and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ es .
the decision whether the treatment is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , should be led until the inten@@ tion of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ ed weight gain is detected , which can be stir@@ ring in some cases with liquid tention .
as a result of a her@@ o@@ dies , a minor reduction in central hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) is increased .
similar changes have been observed with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in the disease by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and for a minor dimension in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ els and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction in the hem@@ or@@ global@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitive therap@@ ies consists of patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral dual or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ sier hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
following the market launch , under the treatment of Th@@ i@@ az@@ ol@@ at@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , including a re@@ jection or deter@@ i@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms report with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear if there is a direct connection between the taking of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ gn@@ ity if patients should be informed of distur@@ b@@ ances of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ology should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages un@@ wanted events regarding bones from random@@ ised controlled trials , double @-@ blind clinical studies have been treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture inc@@ idence of 1.9 frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for 100 patients per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative media .
during the PRO@@ AC@@ TIVE study , a study of 3.5 years for study of cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events , rates are treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patient who were treated with a compar@@ ative media .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to be a pregnancy or this , the treatment is to be used ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for exam@@ ines the interaction effects have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or Pharmac@@ odynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines prescribed by these enz@@ ym@@ es , e.g. or@@ ale contra@@ ven@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and HM@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ tions are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fib@@ ro@@ z@@ il ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2C@@ 8- In@@ hib@@ itor ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 induc@@ tor ) resulting in a decrease of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ em@@ emia in the pregnancy , and increased ins@@ ulin @-@ resistance to the mater@@ nal subst@@ rates and reduces the availability of met@@ abolic rate .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; commonly used &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occas@@ ionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data in@@ valuable ) .
this lead to a temporary change in tur@@ mo@@ ors and fr@@ active index of the lens , as well as for other hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ ous substances .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , ALT @-@ An@@ ge came across the triple the upper limit of the norm , but less often than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in a Out@@ come study of patients with existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was about 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is res@@ p .
since market launch , sel@@ dom has been reported using cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , more common when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or people with heart failure at the history of history .
a summar@@ izing analysis of messages from random@@ ised clinical trials included in random@@ ised controlled trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative media treated groups .
during a period of 3.5 years , rates are based on 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared with 23 / 905 ( 2.5 % ) patients treated with a compar@@ ative media .
in taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day , over four days , then 180 mg / day have no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appears above a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator of Activ@@ ated Rece@@ pt@@ or @-@ γ ) , which leads in the animal model to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitive v@@ ility of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peri@@ pher@@ al glu@@ cos@@ it@@ ics in the case of ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on vers@@ us Gli@@ cl@@ az@@ ide as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investig@@ ate the time until the treatment of therap@@ eutic effects ( defined by H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % according to the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood sugar monitoring ( defined by H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was uph@@ eld by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the patients ( above 50 % of the patients under Gli@@ cl@@ az@@ ide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo analysis more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar have been random@@ ly in@@ sufficient for ins@@ ulin in@@ sufficient , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.45 % , compared with the patients who were still only ins@@ ulin , treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated group .
in clinical trials over a year showed a statist@@ ically significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ations in comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg ) was tested in a small , over 18 weeks for type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction in plasma @-@ tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as slightly marked , however , clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in comparison to Pla@@ ze@@ bo , Met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ az@@ ide reduces the total plas@@ mic gly@@ zer@@ os and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L chol@@ ester@@ ol .
compared to Pla@@ ze@@ bo , there was no statist@@ ically significant increase in L@@ DL chol@@ ester@@ ol levels , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ az@@ ide reduced values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the sh@@ y tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide , but also improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide level , this also improved on the tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide absorption and also on the he@@ pat@@ otic tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide syn@@ thesis .

in the study occurred after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ mirror , which indicates that the blood glucose levels were significantly decreased like with another Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be applied in patients that may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane might be adapted if it is admin@@ istered together with a number of other medicines referred to in the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be removed from packages ) .
the Committee on Human@@ medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane were out@@ we@@ igh in the treatment of diabetes , compared with the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted its approval by the European Union of Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for author@@ ization of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane throughout the European Union .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic will be applied in patients , including ar@@ thritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or g@@ hist@@ ories ( &quot; stones , i.e. greater amount of ur@@ ine deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is more than 6 mg per day , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months , fail@@ ures can still occur ; therefore , patients may be at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of g@@ hist@@ ology .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had tran@@ splant@@ ation , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study carried out at the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effic@@ acy of three of the Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to the plac@@ ebo ( head@@ line treatment ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic have been compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol at 7@@ 62 patients each year .
in both studies , al@@ im@@ pur@@ ine was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with ren@@ al problems were only 100 mg per day .
the main indi@@ gn@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary CO2 levels was in blood with the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients who gave the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily are 120 mg of income , with the last three measurements a ur@@ inary water level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in contrast , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients under al@@ im@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no one of the 134 patients suffer from plac@@ ebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , n@@ au@@ sea , n@@ au@@ sea and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history you may also affect an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective at the lower@@ ing of the ur@@ inary water level in the blood , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to ur@@ at@@ abl@@ es@@ ies ( including one from the medical history of the hist@@ ories and / or of the hist@@ ar@@ thritis ) .
if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ wer mirror after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , an dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg can be taken into account daily .

cardi@@ ov@@ ascular diseases For patients with isch@@ emia or heart failure , treatment is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other persist@@ ent pharmac@@ euticals , it can occur during treatment in an ac@@ ute attack , because of the lower@@ ing of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ wer &apos;s di@@ ure@@ water deposits can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .

it is thus recommended to perform a liver functional test before beginning of the f@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ treatment and in other course of clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophyl@@ line Z@@ acu@@ ity was carried out , but it is known that the XO re@@ spiration may result in an increase in the@@ ophyl@@ line ( a inhib@@ ition of met@@ abol@@ ism has also been reported for other XO @-@ shirts ) .

509 patients received al@@ im@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um circles &gt; 1,5 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 times daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al im@@ perfor@@ ations The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with ren@@ al restri@@ ction .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary objective result was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage of ser@@ ene har@@ ms of subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kid@@ ney function and 55 % in the group with severe kid@@ ney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ concentr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had agreed to study the servo concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected during two years of the open extension study in phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients in patients showed up to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , that less than 3 % of patients required against a shift in weight ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a shift range ) .
this was associated with a reduction of reduction of gases associated with 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the G@@ icht@@ k@@ luft Mountains up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,5 µ@@ Y / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extensions ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects increased plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under plasma cutting time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at upwards and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg of dos@@ ages .

the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take place until after the first food intake of the day , the ear@@ liest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in other medicines prescribed by earlier studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis , to increase the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in terms of increase in vitamin D refle@@ ctions .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE patients ( 11 % ) than those who exclusively contains Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at income ( 32 % ) .
the company also laid data before that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE dose is exactly the dose that is needed for prevention of bone loss .
the most common ad@@ verse events observed ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain , dy@@ ke ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( blood stress ) , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( blood stress ) , stick@@ y Ab@@ dom@@ en ( flo@@ cks ) , and sour cream .
in patients with any sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other parts may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
it must not be applied at diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hyp@@ ocal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients that cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only dil@@ uted with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or influence of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) for the day .
following crit@@ ics are to be form@@ ulated exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE shall be sw@@ allowed according to the day of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , because there is no risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take care of the first food intake of the day that should take place at the ear@@ liest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ oms have been reported in patients under the taking of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( they were mostly heavy and required a hosp@@ itation ) .
the doctor should therefore im@@ pose atten@@ tive to all signs and symptoms that determine on possible mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation like dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain when sw@@ allowing , or retro@@ star pain or new or become an@@ no@@ ying so@@ d@@ ding to remove the medicine and to allow medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe non@@ eth@@ ical side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take it correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that are taking on a mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all disp@@ ensing instructions are passed on to the patient and to be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large , clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at has no increased risk , were rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some severe and complic@@ ations , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available to give whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ry in patients who need a jaw surgical procedure , which reduces the risk of ost@@ e@@ ti@@ os of the pine .
clinical assessment by the treatment physician is significant for therap@@ ie@@ vement in every patient based on individual use risk assessment .
the patients should be instru@@ cted to take the tablet in the next morning by taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE dose after taking their supply .
you should not take two tablets at the same day but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week .
other diseases caused by the mineral abol@@ ism ( such as vitamin D def@@ iciency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ id@@ ism ) , should also be treated prior to the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and several oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking off at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see section 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical studies with a multitude of usually prescribed medicines prescribed by clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is merely planned for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or pregnant women .

Adv@@ ag@@ raf is admin@@ istered over adult patients to tran@@ sp@@ ate kid@@ ney or liver , to prevent a collap@@ se of the tran@@ splan@@ ted organ through the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ mer@@ us , and Pro@@ gra@@ f , the company has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously performed studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
furthermore , results of a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients with kid@@ ney tran@@ splant@@ ation were presented , where@@ by the application of Adv@@ ag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
main indi@@ gn@@ ator of the effic@@ acy was the number of patients with which the tran@@ splan@@ ts was taken after a treatment duration of one year ( as often been investig@@ ated as often a re@@ fr@@ active tran@@ splant@@ ation was required ) .
more recent studies in 119 patients with kid@@ ney tran@@ splant@@ ation and 129 patients were performed with liver tran@@ splant@@ ation and exam@@ ines how Adv@@ ag@@ raf is absorbed in comparison with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

due to clin@@ ically rele@@ asing the system@@ ic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this may lead to tran@@ splan@@ ts or increased inc@@ idence of side effects , including sub@@ - or excess baggage .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ pt@@ us form@@ ulation and regul@@ ate the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulation of form@@ ulation or regime should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced medical treatment ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in consequ@@ ence of a switch to alternative form@@ ulation , a therap@@ eutic drug , and appropriate dos@@ ages must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic ex@@ position of Tac@@ te@@ lim@@ us will remain .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of abstr@@ action and toler@@ ability in individual and on blood levels ( see below &quot; recommendations
after upgra@@ ding from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror should be controlled from the switch and over two weeks after change@@ over .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a Tal@@ ent level , with both form@@ ulations both for both kid@@ ney and trans@@ forming patients were comparable .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mir@@ rors are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splant@@ ation under Adv@@ ag@@ raf to ensure adequate substance ex@@ position in the immediate effect of tran@@ splant@@ ation .
as Tac@@ ro@@ ica is a substance with low cle@@ ar@@ ders , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ raf can take several days until the ste@@ ady State reaches .

further dos@@ ages can be required later , as the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may change in the course of stabil@@ isation of patients after the tran@@ splant@@ ation .
dos@@ ages recommendations - liver tran@@ splant@@ ation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis assist@@ ed the oral Adv@@ og@@ raf therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift of the morning .
Dos@@ age recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be provided twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at one time daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf . thus , this conversion has to be taken in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dosage .
kid@@ ney and liver tran@@ splant@@ ation After a switch from other immun@@ oh@@ si@@ va on Adv@@ ag@@ raf a day must begin the treatment with the recommended dose of liver and liver tran@@ splant@@ ation recommended for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the tran@@ splant@@ ation .
heart tran@@ spl@@ ant For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ raf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily .
other tran@@ splant@@ ation was probably non @-@ clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ raf with lung , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ tran@@ splant@@ ed patients in an oral initi@@ ating dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and by intest@@ inal tran@@ splant@@ ation was 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ ts in special patient @-@ groups associated with reduced liver function for maint@@ aining blood tal@@ ents in the target@@ ed range can be necessary in patients with heavy liver dys@@ function .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function when kid@@ ney function exerc@@ ised no influence on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ te@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose is not required .
due to ne@@ phr@@ oto@@ x@@ ic Pot@@ enti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular mining of ser@@ um circles ) is recommended to calculation the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ .@@ ance and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume .
transfer of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ag@@ raf For the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the whole blood levels in the whole blood The dose should be based on the clinical assessment of abstr@@ action and toler@@ ability in individual inc@@ ident of whole blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ent controls .
it is recommended to conduct the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ ent level during the first two weeks following tran@@ splant@@ ation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood supply levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after shif@@ ting pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ sing , amend@@ ments to imm@@ ort@@ al therapy or at the same term of substances which the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration could be controlled ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with low Cle@@ arance , adjust@@ ments the dose may need to have several days to ste@@ ady State .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley view is not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the rate level of Tac@@ ro@@ ica usually lies in the whole blood in the first time after liver tran@@ splan@@ ts in the field of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for gar@@ nish and cor@@ dial @-@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kid@@ ney and cardi@@ ac tran@@ splant@@ ation were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to difficult undes@@ ir@@ able events , including tran@@ splan@@ ts effects or other side effects that can occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ pt@@ us form@@ ulation and regul@@ ate the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulation of form@@ ulation or regime should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced medical treatment ( see section 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ splan@@ ts of disease , which are proven to other immun@@ os@@ si@@ va as a therap@@ ist , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ly form@@ ulation adv@@ ances .
in childhood proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis assist@@ ants with adult heart tran@@ splant@@ ation and tran@@ splan@@ ts in child@@ surgery are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ly form@@ ulation adv@@ ances before .
because of possible interaction effects , which can lead to an approach of single @-@ oxid@@ ation levels in the blood and weak@@ ening of the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the in@@ gest@@ ation of herbal supplements ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedi@@ es may be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ i concentr@@ ations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable flu@@ ctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases a tom@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ y was able to observe the chamber or se@@ pt@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ies that can also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
other factors which increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ orders , are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , hyper@@ tension , kid@@ ney disease , kid@@ ney or liver dys@@ function , inf@@ ections , fluid load and oil .
like with other immun@@ oh@@ si@@ va , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of comparable clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor .
if patients suffering from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changes , consciousness and asp@@ ir@@ ation should indicate a radi@@ ological study ( e.@@ g ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ raf get hard capsules , l@@ act@@ ose , l@@ act@@ ose , is provided with the rare her@@ ed@@ itable Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ toler@@ ances , l@@ act@@ ase def@@ iciency or glucose @-@ mal@@ act@@ ose specific caution .
the simultaneous application of drugs or herbal re@@ medy that are known as inhib@@ itors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can increase the met@@ abol@@ ism of Tac@@ ro@@ ica and thus reduce blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ um blood levels in the same time of substances that can monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A abol@@ ism , and clar@@ ify the Tac@@ te@@ lim@@ us dosage for maint@@ aining uniform concentration camps accordingly ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong pron@@ oun@@ ced interaction with An@@ tim@@ y@@ kot@@ ika such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ on@@ az@@ ole and with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid anti@@ bi@@ otic of er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ease ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tik@@ en showed that the increase of blood levels is mainly from the elev@@ ated oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ te@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhib@@ ition of the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal met@@ abol@@ ism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in ac@@ ute dis@@ respon@@ si@@ can , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on met@@ abol@@ ism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhib@@ itor ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abol@@ ished by psych@@ P3@@ A4 , whose met@@ abol@@ ism can im@@ pair .
as Tac@@ ro@@ ica con@@ stru@@ ct the Cle@@ arance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a and thus increase the hormon@@ al exposure , making decisions about over@@ im@@ aging action is particularly effective .
animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may reduce the Cle@@ arance of Pen@@ to@@ bar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on to extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a low number of investig@@ ations on tran@@ splan@@ ts patient provide increased risk of un@@ wanted events in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va with regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o ex@@ position a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns on event@@ ual in@@ jur@@ ious effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially concerning its effect on kid@@ neys ) is recommended .

Advent is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one due to the lack of factor VIII , con@@ gen@@ ital ble@@ eding interru@@ pt ) .
the dose and frequency of application set up whether adv@@ ances will be used for the treatment of ble@@ eding or pre@@ vent@@ ing ble@@ eding in surgical intervention .
patients with ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor of VIII , lack of ble@@ eding problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plasma , but is produced as a method of combined DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene ( DNA ) which is em@@ pow@@ ering to the formation of the human mind factor VIII .
Advent is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is similar to it , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , among them one study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug may be examined for prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical intervention .
in the main study the effectiveness of adv@@ ances in prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood levels was awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common ad@@ verse events of adv@@ ances ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fe@@ ver ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human mind factor VIII , mouse , or Ham@@ ster@@ protein , or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted its approval to B@@ ax@@ ter AG for use with adv@@ ances in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of the subst@@ itution therapy according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ Mang@@ els , after the place and the extent of ble@@ eding and the clinical condition of the patient .
the factor VIII @-@ activity in the corresponding period shall not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the norm , or I.@@ E. / dl ) .

in@@ jec@@ tions all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger exists for the patient .
during treatment there is to control the admin@@ istered dose and frequency of in@@ jec@@ tions a reasonable identification of the factor VIII plasma level .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different sem@@ vi@@ als .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis took care of ble@@ eding proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses ranging between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. from factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VIII plasma values are not reached , or if the blood pressure is not over@@ whel@@ med with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed in order to prove a inhib@@ itor .
in patients with high inhib@@ itors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therap@@ eutic measures must be weigh@@ ed .
the reduction speed should be set according to the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti@@ bodies ( inhib@@ itors ) against factor VIII is a prominent complic@@ ation in tre@@ ating patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhib@@ itors are always gover@@ ned against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , which are qu@@ an@@ tif@@ ically diagnosed in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) pro ml plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhib@@ itors , cor@@ related with the extent of ex@@ position compared to the factor VIII , where@@ by the risk depends on the biggest 20 exposure times in the biggest and genetic and other factors .
for untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position and an@@ am@@ eth@@ ically well @-@ known inhib@@ itors , due to the change@@ over factor VIII @-@ product on another , the re@@ occur of ( lower @-@ earlier ) inhib@@ itors was observed .
because of the rare appearance of ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and l@@ act@@ ation .
patients under the biggest number of patients applied against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who performed all patients with previously untreated patients , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fe@@ ver and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .

during the whole period , blood cl@@ ots was uph@@ eld and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the Cle@@ arance Rate showed sufficient values in the 15 post@@ operative day .

based on the data available since the initial version , the CH@@ MP has continued to evalu@@ ate the benefits @-@ risk provisions as positive , but in consider@@ ation that the safety profile has to be closely monitored by following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP has provided the basis of safety profile of ADV@@ A@@ TE , which makes a sub@@ mission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation holder should apply for another extension of 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited appointed the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , officially with@@ drawn his application for the application of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
however , they are the breast , the brain , bone or the turn@@ out ( t@@ issues , the other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and rests ) of it .
this is a kind of virus that has gene@@ tically modified that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in it is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which was so al@@ tered that there is no copies of itself and thus no infection can trigger .
adv@@ oc@@ in would have been blow@@ n directly into the tum@@ ours and make the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein which is formed from non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body &apos;s p@@ 53 gene , usually carries a corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can &apos;t be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells may increase and share .
the company appe@@ aled data from a study of patients with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the area of the sub@@ tree , entered into bone and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers to the issues of the company , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the registration of the documents submitted by the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP is a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion was not suff@@ ici@@ ently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours brings benefits for the patient .
the Committee had contrac@@ ted concerns relating to the processing of drug in the body , the way of administration and the security of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not suff@@ ici@@ ently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be made in reliable manner , and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in touch with the patient .
the CH@@ MP does not use the CH@@ MP in consider@@ ation of whether the withdrawal of patients for patients has currently been participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs .
&quot; al@@ tered active ingre@@ dient , means that the tablets are so together so that one of the effective ingredients are immediately released , and the other slowly has been released over some hours .
aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seas@@ onal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fe@@ ver disease ) in patients with nose skin sw@@ elling ( c@@ log@@ ged nose ) in patients with nose skin sw@@ elling ( c@@ log@@ ged nose ) .
for adults and teen@@ agers over 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous mem@@ bran@@ es ( c@@ log@@ ged nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be ref@@ uted to const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main force measurements were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the ay fe@@ ver symptoms that were reported in the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients en@@ rolled their symptoms every 12 hours in a di@@ ary and rated a standard scale as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consider@@ ation of all the cl@@ ay@@ loads of the nose , the patient reported that Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s patients showed an increase in symptoms of 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 6.0 % in patients who were p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients under@@ take a decrease of symptoms of 3@@ 7,4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who are des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common ad@@ verse events of aer@@ in@@ jur@@ ies ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ov@@ itis ) , as@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( loss of loss ) , as@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( loss of loss ) , som@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia ) , anx@@ i@@ ety and ner@@ vo@@ us@@ ness .
aer@@ in@@ aze may in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al substances or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for treatment of allerg@@ ies ) , not applied .
aer@@ in@@ aze doesn &apos;t have to be used in patients that suffer from a bott@@ ling glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ov@@ ascular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , or even a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic impact ( caused by a cere@@ br@@ al stroke ) or have a risk for a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic impact .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval for aer@@ on@@ aze &apos;s transport to aer@@ on@@ aze on the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is in the whole to sw@@ allow ( i.e. without they be cr@@ ushed or che@@ w ) .
aer@@ in@@ aze was to be applied due to the lack of data to im@@ pot@@ ence and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time for 10 days , as for long time application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine may take off at the time .
after the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous sk@@ ins in the upper re@@ spir@@ atory system , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in contains the medicine also con@@ tra @-@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( Mao ) inhib@@ itor or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity combined with other v@@ ases of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , per@@ me@@ lid , ha@@ erg@@ olin , ac@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , ac@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Oxy@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data will not suff@@ ice to add appropriate recommendations to dosage .
safety and effic@@ acy of aer@@ in@@ aze were not examined in patients with kid@@ ney or liver dys@@ function and the data will not suff@@ ice to add appropriate recommendations to dosage .
patients need to be informed that the treatment in occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or a speed@@ os , heart rhyth@@ mic dis@@ orders , n@@ au@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be cancelled .
in treatment of treatment groups : patients with cardi@@ ac disease patients suffering from cardi@@ ac disease • patients with hyper@@ rhyth@@ m@@ osis • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the medical history , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ ster@@ ity , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the history .
aer@@ in@@ aze has to dep@@ loy at least 48 hours before the performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , because anti@@ hist@@ amine can prevent positive reactions for skin reactions or reduce in their extent .
within the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been admin@@ istered , however , non @-@ clinical interaction or changes in plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and matched to plac@@ ebo patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
this un@@ abol@@ ism of the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Respon@@ z@@ ym was not yet identified so that inter@@ actions with other medicines can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine inhib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D6 are not inhib@@ ited and neither a subst@@ rate nor a inhib@@ itor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
the in@@ spir@@ acy of use of aer@@ in@@ jur@@ ies during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ anc@@ ies however no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since Re@@ productive studies on animals should not always be transferred to humans and due to the v@@ as@@ ok@@ on@@ stri@@ tractor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in should not be applied to aer@@ in@@ aze in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clar@@ ified in very rare cases that may lead to a im@@ pair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S de@@ pression ( bom@@ bing , ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , com@@ a , heart circulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , counter@@ acts ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ies .

a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation is especially likely to children , just like at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pu@@ pill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ lem@@ ma , skin irrit@@ ation , hyper@@ therm@@ ia and Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
this close to inhib@@ iting the release of inflamm@@ atory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 13 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ iles as well as the inhib@@ ition of the expression of the adhesion rate P @-@ S@@ elek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring ranges of air performance including the amplif@@ ication of sub@@ jec@@ tive imp@@ lic@@ ations or the tasks that are connected with the flies .
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day , increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess were determined in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause any symp@@ ath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects as such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ dia or manif@@ est@@ ations of a Z@@ NS revi@@ val .
it took 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seas@@ onal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis where 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets were determined based on the total score for symptoms of symptoms ( except os@@ mu@@ cos@@ al sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the weak@@ ening effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to sex , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ec@@ table within 30 minutes after sub@@ mission of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze of healthy volunteers on 14 days the flow@@ rate of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic @-@ multi@@ fac@@ eted study , which was performed using form@@ ulation on healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were otherwise noted .
a component @-@ Inter@@ act study shows that the ex@@ position ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in after the sole of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in bio@@ equivalent was to ex@@ position according to an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on the conventional trials for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in repeated G@@ abe , for gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and reproduction of high @-@ production data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , no special dang@@ ers to humans are recogn@@ iz@@ able .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects rose in the context with the syn@@ op@@ sy p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in .
in re@@ productive @-@ free technology , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was in the oral gift of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

Aer@@ ius should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ adin , or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted a approval for Aer@@ ius on the transport network of Aer@@ ius in the entire European Union .
one capsule once daily , with one or without meal , for the alle@@ viation of the symptoms of allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies at the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should termin@@ ate equivalent to the previous clinical symptoms and can be res@@ umed after the sound of the symptoms and during which re@@ occur will be res@@ umed .
if persist@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during allerg@@ y time a continuous treatment .
clinical @-@ relevant inter@@ actions were not adopted in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine pills not to be given to er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ology study it was not increased in the equ@@ il@@ ibri@@ um of aer@@ ius and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clar@@ ified in very rare cases , which may lead to any im@@ pair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
at clinical trials in various indic@@ ations , including allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with Aer@@ ius on patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events that were reported more frequently than at Plac@@ ebo ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
with a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect head@@ aches , which were treated at 5,9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and were treated at 6.9 % of the patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( n@@ inth clinical dose ) were given , no clinical effects were observed .
this includes both inhib@@ ition of anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human body cells / Bas@@ oph@@ iles as well as the inhib@@ ition of the expression of the adhesion firm P @-@ S@@ elek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , a dose of up to 20 mg was admin@@ istered daily for 14 days , has no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant kar@@ di@@ ov@@ ascular effect .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ology study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ time clinical dose ) was admin@@ istered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ TC interval .
in an individual study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring ranges of air performance including the amplif@@ ication of sub@@ jec@@ tive imp@@ lic@@ ations or the tasks that are connected with the flies .
in patients with allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis , Aer@@ ius was effective in relie@@ ving symptoms such as ri@@ v@@ ae , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching flow and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to established classification in seas@@ onal and per@@ enn@@ ial , allergic Rhin@@ ol@@ at@@ itis may be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms or an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis and persist@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as the total score of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , Aer@@ ius effectively reduce the burden caused by seas@@ onal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ aria was to be examined for further forms of ur@@ tik@@ aria , because the under@@ lying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology have given the under@@ lying path@@ ology in the different forms of different forms , and chronic patients can be sim@@ ulated .
since the hist@@ amine release is a susp@@ ected factor in all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ ous diseases , that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also listed in other forms of ur@@ tik@@ aria in other forms of ur@@ tik@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , Aer@@ ius was effective in improving the size and number of h@@ ives at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine drugs , the minority in patients who responded not to anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , elim@@ inated from the study .
improvements to a population of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with de@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with Aer@@ ius reduced the dis@@ order of the sleeping and watch@@ word , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evalu@@ ate this variable .
in a Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , which was comparable to patients with seas@@ onal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis population , was achieved at 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no focal points for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , this was not identified for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine of the enz@@ y@@ me yet so that inter@@ actions with other pharmac@@ euticals will not be excluded completely
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine inhib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D6 are not inhib@@ ited and neither a subst@@ rate nor a inhib@@ itor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ sier study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( gre@@ asy , low @-@ cal@@ ory breakfast ) are not out of availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the experiments performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed a compar@@ ative degree of ex@@ position of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative comparison regarding the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and of Lor@@ at@@ adin .

Aer@@ ius can be taken regardless of the meals , in relie@@ ving symptoms of allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the driving doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years of infection are caused by an infection ( see below 4.4 ) and that no data are proposed to support the treatment of a inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous r@@ hin@@ itis with Aer@@ ius .
in addition to the excl@@ usion of upper re@@ spir@@ atory action or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ al@@ ies should play a role in the diagnosis , physical examination , and appropriate laboratory and skin tests .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abolic dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is restricted and experienced a higher substance ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of Aer@@ ius sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted met@@ abol@@ ism is identical with children who met@@ abo@@ liz@@ ed normally met@@ abol@@ ism .
this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose in@@ toler@@ ant , glucose @-@ absor@@ bing or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine do not take .
clinical @-@ relevant inter@@ actions were not adopted in clinical trials with Aer@@ ius tablets , which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole are taken in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ology study at the same time of taking of aer@@ ius tablets and alcohol , the effective influence of alcohol was not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of ad@@ verse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aer@@ ius sy@@ rup group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
at clinical trials with adults and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents in different indic@@ ations , including allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with Aer@@ ius on patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and young people who were given up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( n@@ inth clinical dose ) , no clinical effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 years entered for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy of 1,25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ car@@ ia and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , can increase the effectiveness of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults on the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple in@@ jur@@ ies in adults and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , was not described statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant kar@@ di@@ ov@@ ascular effect .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ology study of adults and yo@@ ungst@@ ers , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ time clinical dose ) was employed over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ TC interval .
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess were determined in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
at a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , Aer@@ ius tablets produced in clinical trials to no im@@ pair@@ ment of Psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ology studies in adults it was neither to an increase of alcohol induc@@ ed performance nor to increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and young patients with allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis , Aer@@ ius tablets were effective in relie@@ ving symptoms such as ri@@ v@@ ae , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching flow and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as the total score of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , Aer@@ ius tablets have been effective , reduce the seas@@ onal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , Aer@@ ius was effective in improving the size and number of h@@ ives at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otyp@@ e was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both pop@@ ulations ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar phar@@ yn@@ ore@@ tical parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ course study with si@@ r@@ ative r@@ hin@@ itis in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic pre@@ abolic disease .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no focal points for one clinical @-@ relevant active ingre@@ dient after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents .
12 In various individual research studies , the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , this did not identify the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine of the enz@@ y@@ me yet so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. receives his application for approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on approval for the distribution of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and older adults .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and el@@ derly people to protect the fl@@ u ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 virus ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 virus .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ine that could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic to protect a future pan@@ dem@@ ic .
a influ@@ enza pan@@ dem@@ ic breaks out if a new tribe of the influ@@ enza has grown slightly , because the people still lack an imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system detected the vacc@@ ine contained in the vacc@@ ine as &quot; physical foreign &quot; and makes anti@@ bodies against it .
this way , the immune system is then able to form faster anti@@ bodies in contact with an influ@@ enza .
the mem@@ bran@@ es of the virus with &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( protein in the reed surface , which recognize the human body as a body @-@ alien ) , is cleaned and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine .
an inspec@@ tor of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this reduces the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of vacc@@ ine to meet the requirements of the EMEA to Pre@@ pan@@ ic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in a clinical examination and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s treated doctor .
if you wish to read more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ def@@ iciency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot be sw@@ allowed as a solution , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this can not be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should then be prescribed when the doctor has checked the an@@ tivir@@ al medic@@ inal of the patient had previously used , and the ability to address the virus to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which can be taken with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and with other an@@ tivir@@ al drug .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase Re@@ duc@@ es in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level .
Aids does not cure AIDS , but can prevent the damage of the immune system and thereby the development of AIDS connected inf@@ ections and ill@@ nesses .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not been treated with Prot@@ ease .
the anti @-@ conden@@ sed R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who used formerly Prot@@ ease In@@ hib@@ itors of other Prot@@ eas@@ ants .
main indi@@ gn@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the proportion of patients with non det@@ ec@@ table concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ al load ) or the change of vir@@ al load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously occupied no Prot@@ ease of patients had no vir@@ al load under 400 copies / ml compared to plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than ins@@ din@@ av@@ ir .
in children , A@@ de@@ bit reduced the vir@@ al load , but one of the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ ru@@ ding was only very few in the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ru@@ ding compounds , en@@ counter@@ ed with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir reinforced drugs as effective after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other Prot@@ ease In@@ hib@@ itors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other Prot@@ ease of patients , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir for a stronger dec@@ ay of vir@@ al load after four weeks than in patients who continue their hi@@ ber@@ nation to date :
the most common ad@@ verse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , Nau@@ sea ( n@@ au@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be applied in patients that are de@@ hydr@@ ated ( a herbal supplement for tre@@ ating de@@ pression ) or medic@@ inal products that are dis@@ mant@@ led and in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health , are taken .
how in other medicines to HIV exists in patients who are A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of bone tissue ) , a ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ ros@@ is ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immune activ@@ ating syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by the recovered immune system ) .
at the end , the Committee on Human@@ medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase during application in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years over against risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , but the Committee set out that the benefits of A@@ de@@ bit in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir are taken in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir for patients who had previously not been proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as at the time of approval for scientific reasons , limited information were submitted .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Commission of Gl@@ ax@@ o Group to permit approval for the use of A@@ gener@@ ase throughout the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected persons , Prot@@ ease In@@ hib@@ itors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children 4 years .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmaceutical inet@@ comm@@ y of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( see section 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir should take place in consider@@ ation of the individual vir@@ al resistance patterns and the prior @-@ line treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as a solution to incl@@ usion is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir twice daily with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
2 If au@@ tho@@ ase capsules without the inten@@ tion of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effic@@ acy and safety of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir or other Prot@@ ease were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data to dis@@ comfort and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use of liver with mild or moderate liver dys@@ function with caution is to be contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dys@@ function ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase will not be able to poss@@ ess a small therap@@ eutic width as well as the subst@@ rates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the contrac@@ tual effect of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy are not leading to healing of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infection or other complic@@ ations of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prev@@ ented not the risk of a transmission of HIV on others by sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic he@@ patitis B or C and with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have increased risk for heavy liver problems with potenti@@ ally dead@@ ly evolution .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of Hepatitis B or C please read the specialist information of this medicine .
patients with above @-@ existing liver function including chronic and chronic he@@ patitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ function under a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir are conf@@ used with Flu@@ tic@@ ast or other Gl@@ uc@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , which is not recommended that the potential use of the risk of dynamic corporate @-@ ero@@ es effects including mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and reg@@ ression of the side @-@ ren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as a subst@@ rate of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase @-@ inhib@@ itors are strongly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 because of the increased risk of fi@@ opath@@ y , including R@@ hu@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen , is not recommended .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as carb@@ am@@ a@@ zep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ cy@@ c@@ ate , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alised ) , methods are possible to determine the substance concentration .
in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma level by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , patients should therefore be performed based on Op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , in particular if there are even low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity of a tox@@ icity in the A@@ gener@@ ative solution , this latter form is con@@ tra @-@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution regarding certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a r@@ ash occurs in system@@ ic or allergic reaction ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ant therapy , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ation of an existing Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases to whose therapy medication were required to associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer and@@ au@@ ern@@ de anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders .
in hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ru@@ ding compounds , reports on an increase of ble@@ eding including spont@@ aneous c@@ utt@@ led ha@@ em@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
the HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immun@@ o@@ def@@ ect can become an anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) at the time of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infection , which leads to serious clinical condition or deter@@ i@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multif@@ un@@ tor@@ ial tor@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ides , alcohol use heavy immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression ) , cases of ost@@ e@@ ec@@ ros@@ is especially reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combinations ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 subst@@ rate with small therap@@ eutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase shall not be able to poss@@ ess a low therap@@ eutic width as well as subst@@ rates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D6 @-@ Subst@@ rate with small therap@@ eutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir should not be combined with drugs , which are mainly associated with drugs , and for increased plasma level with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease of the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which can cause a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance trend .
when empt@@ ing , plasma glucose levels in combination with a dose increase of other Prot@@ ease In@@ hib@@ itors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir were observed very frequently un@@ wanted effects on the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) can be canc@@ eled by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St John &apos;s wort , the pren@@ eur@@ ial level is possible and if possible to inspec@@ t the vir@@ al load and the St John &apos;s wort gener@@ ously .
a dose adap@@ tion for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ glo@@ av@@ ir are given together with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see also E@@ quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire below ) .
508 % increased , for by contrast , if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir were used twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice daily which cover the effic@@ acy and warm@@ th of this treatment schem@@ atic .
52 % bought if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 750 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in plasma , which were obtained in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) , there are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) met in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily .
a dosing rate for the simultaneous failure of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended because the effectiveness and in@@ spir@@ acy of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ thetic study on the application of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Did@@ an@@ os@@ in , but is recommended that the proce@@ eds of Did@@ an@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ az@@ ida below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ ic@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dos@@ ages is required .
the treatment with E@@ asp@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir is not recommended as the ex@@ position of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be serious .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other Prot@@ ease In@@ hib@@ itors and existing data suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in may possibly tum@@ ble the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
if these drugs are used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therap@@ eutic plasma level .
if these drugs are used together , caution is provided ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a precise pre@@ diction of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is difficult .
simultaneous alle@@ viation of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in the plasma concentration of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in , around 193 % , and thus an increase in severe side effects associated with R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in .
if any clinical reasons is necessary to obtain R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ de@@ ase , to reduce the dosage of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in , at least half the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma level of both pharmac@@ euticals could be increased .
the simultaneous application of 700 mg of m@@ ould ren@@ av@@ ir and 100 mg of m@@ ould con@@ az@@ ole daily in plasma increased by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 2 ) to 2.@@ 69 times a day , which is observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole daily , which was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole daily without a con@@ current application of f@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
other medicines listed below are listed below , including subst@@ rates , inhib@@ itors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may possibly lead to inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs , if they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other Prot@@ ease In@@ hib@@ itors , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ az@@ ida is not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption dis@@ orders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ex @-@ vul@@ va , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ am@@ a@@ zep@@ ine , carb@@ am@@ a@@ zep@@ ine , carb@@ am@@ a@@ zep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir may lead to a reduction of the plasma level of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
the ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium channel block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fer@@ odi@@ pine , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , thereby increases the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
the simultaneous dosage with A@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors can increase and increase the effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , long@@ suffering and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg capsules twice daily , with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) were significantly increased , while the end@@ ogen@@ eous inf@@ lic@@ ism rose by about 86 % ( 90 % conversion inter@@ v@@ all 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the same gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is not recommended that this Gl@@ uc@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids are not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment that weighs the risk of dynamic cor@@ tical ero@@ es ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors such as Lov@@ ry@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , their hydrogen rot@@ ates strongly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 are expected to exp@@ ire the plasma level of the plasma level during equ@@ il@@ ibri@@ um .
as plasma level increases this h@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itor in my@@ opath@@ y , including R@@ hy@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended .
it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of therap@@ eutic concentr@@ ations till the stabil@@ ization of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used together with oral mid @-@ mid Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am is advis@@ able .
data for simultaneously usage of par@@ enter@@ al Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am with other Prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors point out a possible increase of the plasma level of mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am um 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is admin@@ istered together with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , patients should therefore be admin@@ istered on Op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , in particular if there are even low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
because of the per small loading of historic compar@@ is@@ ons , no recommendation can be given , as the Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir dose is given , if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is admin@@ istered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
in the same time of goods of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulations together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir on hormon@@ al contra@@ diction is not required , therefore alternative methods recommended for contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therap@@ eutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycles of non @-@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ ypt@@ il@@ in ) is recommended at the same time gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , the medicine may only be applied to careful dis@@ placement of possible use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk laugh@@ ing rats were proven to be Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir goes over to humans into the breast milk .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats who was given by the influence in the uter@@ us until the end of the l@@ act@@ ation Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , showed an increase in 12 body weight during bre@@ ast@@ feeding .
the further development of the offspring including fer@@ t@@ ility and re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir to the dam .
an in@@ conce@@ iv@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly marked until moderate , appearing early on and led rarely to treatment out@@ break .
many of these events cannot be clar@@ ified if they are related to suffering from A@@ gener@@ ase or another to the HIV @-@ treatment , or if they are a consequ@@ ence of the disease .
most of the listed side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , which were not treated twice per day with prot@@ ru@@ ding compounds ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , identified by investig@@ ators in connection with the study medication , and in connection with more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment performed in labor@@ atories ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a revolution of body fat ( lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ al and fine grease guns , increased intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ ber@@ y fat accum@@ ulation ( stit@@ ched ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated persons who had been treated with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a mean duration of 36 weeks was only a case ( stit@@ ched ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study under Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir 7 cases ( 3 % ) in comparison to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ av@@ ir , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin envelop@@ es were usually mild to pron@@ oun@@ ced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ul@@ op@@ ap@@ ults nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without that the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir had to be broken .
cases of ost@@ e@@ ec@@ ros@@ is were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combinations ( ART ) .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ retro@@ active reaction to asym@@ pt@@ omatic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infection ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) , which were observed twice daily with low dosing R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which was observed in patients with low de@@ ported R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were used in patients with low de@@ sier@@ ra R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir which were very common .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is to observe on the signs of an in@@ tox@@ ication ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures necessary .
Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ests and thus prevents the process of vir@@ al g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - Poly@@ protein levels with the result of a formation of un@@ rip@@ tive , non @-@ inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous virus particles .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investig@@ ated both ac@@ ute and chronic infected l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell@@ ars ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ pher@@ al blood l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhib@@ itor ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is in the area of 0,0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M of ac@@ utely inf@@ ested cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M of chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhib@@ ition of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lic@@ ation in humans is not yet defined .
in treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients with the currently approved f@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir dosing systems - like with other R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir gran@@ ulated treatment schem@@ as - the described mut@@ ations is rarely observed .
at six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir have received daily ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 732 twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 732 , where 14 ins@@ ulates were gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension of AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir / 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily : N = 107 ) patients treated with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following Prot@@ ease In@@ hib@@ itors :
analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients with Prot@@ ease Pharmac@@ euticals .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and a lower@@ ed prob@@ ability of a vi@@ rology response ( resistance ) .
the concl@@ usions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation pattern can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to draw the current interpretation systems to analy@@ ze resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance based on phen@@ otyp@@ ical value analysis systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients with Prot@@ ease Pharmac@@ euticals .
companies that distri@@ bute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( part@@ itions ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used for interpre@@ ting results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir associated pattern generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ av@@ ir , Nel@@ glo@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir are generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and other Prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously treated patients with whom a f@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Tip@@ ran@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir reserves his activity against some other Prot@@ ease isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears from the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the tigh@@ tening of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which may affect the subsequent treatment .
the cover of the effic@@ acy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ o@@ sid@@ analog ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , pre@@ domin@@ ated with low @-@ controlled R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir . &quot;
an hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity compared to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one of the other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
primary analysis carried out the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir compared to the period adjusted average value of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in the vir@@ al load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma last 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ s@@ able threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the receipt of effic@@ acy of un@@ bi@@ ased areas is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV inf@@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was examined daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily , where@@ by the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / mL at a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Bas@@ ed on this data should be considered under the treatment optim@@ isation of the expected benefit of &quot; ir@@ re@@ por@@ ous &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is approximately 1 @-@ 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for by contrast , by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) is admin@@ istered together with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the sub@@ mission of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of Res@@ or@@ ption .
the se@@ em@@ ulation volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be mounted to a large volume of volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ ted penet@@ ration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir from the blood stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the substance in the plasma , where the amount of un@@ w@@ alled am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which is the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ w@@ alled Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients in the Ste@@ ady State concentration in the Ste@@ ady State at the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore the medic@@ inal products must be induc@@ ed or inhib@@ it the CY@@ P3@@ A4 if they are admin@@ istered with caution , if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the addition of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ex@@ position as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is obtained from the solution 14 % less bi@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams @-@ base .
also , ren@@ al Cle@@ arance of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is neg@@ lig@@ ible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al im@@ pair@@ ment to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir should be minor .
this treatment schem@@ es lead to Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir @-@ plasma glucose levels comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir twice a day without simultaneous release of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
in long @-@ term studies with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in mice and rats served on male animals named he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome with doses of the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8- @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily allowance of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emer@@ gence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome was not yet resol@@ ved and the relev@@ ance of this observed effect for people is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data on people , either from clinical studies or from the therap@@ eutic use , however , little clu@@ es to the acceptance of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity tests , the bacter@@ ial reverse Mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , micro@@ nuclear test to rats and chrom@@ os@@ ome l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was inc@@ oto@@ x@@ ic neither mut@@ iny nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be controlled and proved in clinical everyday life by measuring A@@ ST , ALT and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients neither during the treatment of A@@ gener@@ ase nor by the end of treatment .
studies for tox@@ icity in young animals , who were treated with 4 days at the age of 4 , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and with the Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
in a system@@ ic plasma spot that was significantly higher ( rats ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus el@@ ong@@ ation and slightly increased sk@@ el@@ eton changes were observed .
24 If au@@ tho@@ ase capsules , without the amplif@@ iers of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be eff@@ ected in patients with weak or slight liver dys@@ function with caution , in patients with severe liver dys@@ function she is inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as carb@@ am@@ a@@ zep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ cy@@ c@@ ate , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ alised ) , methods are possible to determine the substance concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 27 if a r@@ ash occurs in system@@ ic or allergic reaction ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for Lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer and@@ au@@ ern@@ de anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease of the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which can cause a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance trend .
508 % increased , for by contrast , if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in plasma , which were obtained in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) , there are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) met in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily .
a dosing rate for the simultaneous failure of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended because the effectiveness and in@@ spir@@ acy of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ asp@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir is not recommended as the ex@@ position of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be serious .
if these drugs are used together , caution is provided ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a precise pre@@ diction of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is difficult .
if any clinical reasons is necessary to obtain R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ de@@ ase , to reduce the dosage of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in , at least half the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
the ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium channel block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fer@@ odi@@ pine , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , n@@ ins@@ an@@ pin , thereby increases the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg capsules twice daily , with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) were significantly increased , while the end@@ ogen@@ eous inf@@ lic@@ ism rose by about 86 % ( 90 % conversion inter@@ v@@ all 82 to 89 % ) .
in the same time of goods of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulations together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous release of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) lead to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir around 22 %
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after thor@@ ough extraction of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats who was given by the influence in the uter@@ us until the end of l@@ act@@ ation Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , showed a reduced increase in body weight during bre@@ ast@@ feeding .
an in@@ conce@@ iv@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is to observe on the signs of an in@@ tox@@ ication ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures necessary .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investig@@ ated both ac@@ ute and chronic infected l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell@@ ars ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as also peri@@ pher@@ al blood l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhib@@ itor ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is in the area of 0,0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M with chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,50 µg / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir reserves his activity against some other Prot@@ ease isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears from the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the treatment optim@@ ization of &quot; ir@@ re@@ por@@ tedly &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; should be considered during the treatment optim@@ isation associated with PI .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ w@@ alled Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients in the Ste@@ ady State concentration in the Ste@@ ady State at the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore the medic@@ inal products must be induc@@ ed or inhib@@ it the CY@@ P3@@ A4 if they are admin@@ istered with caution , if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

studies for tox@@ icity in young animals , who were treated with 4 days at the age of 4 , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and with the Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .

A@@ gener@@ ase solution to entry is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected persons , Prot@@ ease In@@ hib@@ itors and children 4 years of age .
the use of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir &quot; bun@@ dl@@ ed &quot; A@@ de@@ bit solution for entry was neither treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI previously treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as a solution to incl@@ usion is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be able once they are able to sw@@ allow the capsules , taking the intake of the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs as far as to a daily dose of 2800 mg of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as a dosing schedule for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low dosing R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir can be avoided , these combination with these patient items can be avoided .
although a dose can not be counted for Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for incl@@ usion in patients with ren@@ al failure is indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
owing to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high Prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ ph@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts is A@@ general solution for inser@@ tion in inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with ren@@ al failure .
the simultaneous ver@@ ification can lead to a competent inhib@@ ition of this medicine and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects like heart rhyth@@ mic dys@@ function ( z .
the patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy are not leading to healing of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infection or other complic@@ ations of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prev@@ ented not the risk 47 of a transmission of HIV on others by sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .

A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to duration if a r@@ ash occurs in system@@ ic or allergic reaction ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for Lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as a longer and@@ au@@ ern@@ de anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders .

it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease of the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which can cause a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance trend .
508 % increased , for by contrast , if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous dosage with A@@ de@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentration in connection with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , long@@ suffering and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data to 54 other CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors , high plasma cent@@ ur@@ ations from mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am was significantly reduced .
the potential risk of human beings is not known . A@@ de@@ ase solution to influence may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us . ( see section 4.3 ) .

in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream but without the active ingre@@ dient ) in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the gen@@ ital area every 16 weeks .
main indi@@ gn@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated War@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was studied in two studies in which the patients were treated for six weeks , with Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo either a day or five times a week .
main indi@@ gn@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a has also been tested in two studies of 505 patients with different tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . during the treatment of women in the gen@@ ital patients , however , the results of both studies on Bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas demonstrated a complete reduction ratio of 66 % to 80 % of patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .

the following not neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , rigid joints , reduces the movements , di@@ min@@ ished l@@ ungs , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in tre@@ ating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital , or hospital with r@@ ins@@ ulating equipment , and patients need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the medicine was examined , however , its effectiveness was measured by its effect in relation to reducing the G@@ AG concentration camps in the ur@@ ine and in relation to the size of the liver .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me increased the G@@ AG @-@ concentr@@ ations in the ur@@ ine around 60 % , and half of the treated children dis@@ missed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , abdominal pain , r@@ end@@ alg@@ ia ( joint pain ) , pain , pain in the limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat as@@ sion , fe@@ ver and reactions at the Inf@@ usion Observ@@ atory .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ dia ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fe@@ ver and sc@@ rap fro@@ st .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied in patients who may react strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied .
each year , the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be able to check all new information that may be announced and updated this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients to observe the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reactions in relation to inf@@ usion and development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. , its approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a combined form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of a combined DNA technology using CH@@ O acid culture super@@ nat@@ ants ( Chinese ham@@ ster o@@ vary , ov@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enc@@ ap@@ oration therapy in patients with as@@ si@@ ys@@ ac@@ char@@ id@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase lack ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manif@@ est@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient can be increased , every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for this patient .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kid@@ ney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and no dosing scheme can be recommended for this patient .
for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions can be defined as any in relation to inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion process ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in the re@@ loading equipment for medical emerg@@ encies .
as a result of the clinical Phase 3 trial , almost all patients of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase patients are usually within 3 months starting from treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution in use of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience in terms of recovery after a longer break , it must be careful because of the theore@@ tically increased risk campaign after an interru@@ ption of treatment carefully .
60 minutes before the beginning of the inf@@ usion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tica ) to minim@@ ize potential risk of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in case of light or middle infection caused the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in the inf@@ usion rate when the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , serious inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be proved .
inf@@ usion can be entered with a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate when reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in the inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , which occurred the prec@@ eding response .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Pro@@ c@@ ain because a potential risk of inter@@ ference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not occur on direct or indirect benef@@ icial effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
there are no data in new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ elled to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , it is recommended to bre@@ ast@@ feeding the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the effects of clinical trials were instit@@ uted mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted drug reactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension for a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 , are often observed in the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ con@@ ditional participation of upper re@@ spir@@ atory and l@@ ungs , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath@@ s and fac@@ ial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug per@@ v@@ ents related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported in the table under 5 years of age , with greater dam@@ aging form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it came to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , usually within one month to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( res@@ p . until an early withdrawal from the study ) were found in 13 / 45 patients with radio@@ immun@@ o@@ inc@@ ip@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay before , among them 3 patients with which it never had to be ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version .
patients with lack of low anti@@ body levels showed a robust decrease in the Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti@@ body tit@@ ers to establish a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal until low @-@ neutral inhib@@ iting effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed not to im@@ pair the clinical effic@@ acy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to stand in connection with the inc@@ id@@ ence of undes@@ ir@@ able drug reactions , typically with the formation of un@@ wanted drug reactions , typically fell along with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .
the basis for the enz@@ y@@ al therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ se of the accum@@ ulated subst@@ rate and the pre@@ vent@@ ing of another accum@@ ulation of adequate restoration of enz@@ ym@@ es .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly absorbed into the circulation and the les@@ ions , the most likely via Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients in the mean phen@@ otyp@@ e and only a patient dis@@ missed the serious phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an for@@ c@@ ated explic@@ it@@ atory volume ( FE@@ U ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 feet .
the primary end@@ points for effic@@ acy were the percentage change of expected FE@@ U and absolute obe@@ di@@ line in the 6 @-@ minute test test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients against the plac@@ ebo and the obe@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
in an open renewal study , an improvement and / or maintenance of this effects of up to 208 weeks occurs in Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is non @-@ significant over this period and the absolute lung @-@ volume increased propor@@ tional to body @-@ growing children .
one of the 26 patients with a he@@ pat@@ oma of treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG levels was found at Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) who remained constant for the course of the study .
in regard to h@@ eter@@ ogen@@ eous disease manif@@ estation of patients who merged in 6 @-@ minute test ( for the expected percentage of normal subjects ) , was generally one improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and mean worse in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a year @-@ old Open Phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied in 20 patients at the time of their admission to the study below 5 years ( 16 patients with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients , a size increase ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) found out according to the Z score for this age group and all 4 patients with the mean rout@@ ing form proven only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a Phase 4 study investig@@ ations were carried out to pharmaceutical impact of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ ata at the G@@ AG @-@ Mir@@ ror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be with patients who have difficulties with weekly information , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effic@@ acy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evalu@@ ate any new information , which will rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the rug features will be updated .
the pharmaceutical profile in patients under 5 years old was similar to the patients with older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who had previously been not handled in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously applied other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as single therapy .
to decrease any side effects , patients should take a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and in@@ jec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is admin@@ istered to c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , prior to or after the c@@ abe of Cis@@ plat@@ in additionally an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicine against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid def@@ iciency ) .
in patients whose blood picture changes , or during which certain other side effects appear , the treatment should be increased or reduced to the dose .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of pel@@ let re@@ bo@@ xed in its active form is lighter in cancer cells . in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of pharmaceutical and longer treatment in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was investig@@ ated for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ single lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study on 571 patients were treated with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease , which had previously been compared with chemotherapy for doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in was found in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously established no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months in the sole discre@@ tion of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously established a chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months was compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , patients in which cancer are not dependent on record ep@@ ith@@ el@@ ial cells , during the sub@@ mission of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the compar@@ ative media .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. , its approval for the use of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each batch bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is di@@ cul@@ ated with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic bron@@ ch@@ ial cardi@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with cur@@ - K@@ al advanced or metast@@ atic breast cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is admin@@ istered intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion in a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an inf@@ usion about a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after the completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ single bronze car@@ cin@@ oma following chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is admin@@ istered intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion in a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
for reducing the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions one day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed as well as the day after treatment is a Kor@@ tic@@ ost@@ ero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and taking should be continued throughout the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ usc@@ ular injection vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third running cycle .
in patients who receive the pellets , a complete blood picture should be created prior to each gift , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a plat@@ elets .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( ALT or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose examination must take place taking into consider@@ ation of the N@@ adi@@ r@@ s of blood of blood or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspon@@ d to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C Grade 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients aren &apos;t @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grade 3 develop ( except Neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the patient must be interru@@ pted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient must be before the treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients with 2 dos@@ ages , a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or not @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ oner at the occurr@@ ence of Grade 3 or 4 ne@@ ur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or more compared to patients at age 65 years , an increased by @-@ risk premium @-@ risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data to preserve and effectiveness .
in clinical trials were required in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Cle@@ arance of ≥ 45 ml / min there are no dos@@ ages , which are recommended in case of all patients recommended Dos@@ age .
the data sheet in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance between 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however patients with a liver functional restri@@ ction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper level of the upper limit value ( in the absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ times of the upper limit ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not especially studied in studies .
patients must be monitored in patients with regard to the bone mar@@ ri@@ pp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be admin@@ istered before patients before the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ under number will again be a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ and has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dose for more cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ane count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the prec@@ eding treatment cycles .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 h@@ av@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hol@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with grade 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was considered to be considered a prior treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients have to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ - l@@ ak@@ tic measures to reduce the sever@@ ance related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Cle@@ arance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ mon@@ oxide ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients required for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who performed these events , have appropriate risk factors for occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid level collection in tran@@ cell@@ ular space , a drainage of the Erg@@ onom@@ ous flux of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed treatment are expected .
5 severe cardi@@ ov@@ ascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and ro@@ v@@ rov@@ ascular events were occas@@ ionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when the active ingre@@ dient was usually admin@@ istered in combination with another cy@@ t@@ oto@@ x@@ ic active ingre@@ dient .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed li@@ fel@@ ines ( except yellow fe@@ ver , this vacc@@ ine is inde@@ xed ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible sk@@ ull of re@@ productive capacity is made by pel@@ let re@@ bo@@ xed , men should be informed before the treatment of G@@ inn , to receive advice in terms of lock .
in patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Cle@@ arance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ mon@@ oxide ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid could lead to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed chart with the result of an increased occurr@@ ence of side effects .
therefore caution is advis@@ able when patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Cle@@ arance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid can be applied in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid is to be avoided in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed to therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data for interaction potenti@@ als with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds have long half @-@ life as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - .
the large in@@ tra individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between or@@ inal anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ o@@ plast@@ y chemotherapy requires increased surveillance rate of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ) if the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed while sw@@ ing@@ ing , but as at an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ met@@ abol@@ ites are expected during a application in pregnancy heavy birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except the necess@@ ity of the use of the utility for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible sk@@ ull bo@@ xed by pel@@ let re@@ bo@@ xed , men should be informed of treatment before the treatment of treatment , advised in relation to the sperm ser@@ ology .

however , the patient should be recommended to take a supple@@ mentary attack of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin before bed@@ time ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a one @-@ off dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of under volunteers , at the same time or@@ list@@ at , a small decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and are related to pharmac@@ ological effects of drug , as the absorption of drawn fat is prev@@ ented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and tempor@@ arily .
the common@@ alities are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occas@@ ionally ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known ad@@ verse events , which have been observed after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were volun@@ tar@@ ily reported from a population un@@ certain size .
† It is pl@@ au@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to gar@@ ments with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple outlets from up to 400 mg three times daily were given to normal subjects over a period of 15 days , without that significant clinical findings were performed .
the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at over@@ do@@ ers were reported to have no side effects or similar effects such as reported at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at .
based on exam@@ inations of man and animal can result in a rapid return of any system effects that can be attributed to the Lib@@ yan properties of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therap@@ eutic effect lies in the l@@ umen of the Mag@@ ens and the upper thin film through co@@ val@@ ent bonds to the active ser@@ ene rema@@ inder of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic Lip@@ asen .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with an BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 , contains the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hyp@@ oc@@ al@@ ic , low @-@ induc@@ ed nutrition .
the primary parameters , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been as follows : as part of the body weight training , which has more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
while in both studies the weight reduction over 12 months was observed , the largest weight loss came in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall chol@@ ester@@ ol was 60 mg -@@ 2,4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL chol@@ ester@@ ol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
when the wa@@ ist range was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value of 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo @-@ 3,6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma cent@@ ur@@ ations of non met@@ abo@@ liz@@ ed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ ur@@ able 8 hours after oral m@@ ills of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong trig@@ gers for n@@ au@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cis@@ plat@@ in ) , and with chemotherapy for n@@ au@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or car@@ bo@@ plat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( an pharmac@@ euticals that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
application in patients under 18 is not recommended because the effects in this age group will not lie enough information .
this means that the active ingre@@ dient is the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , which prevents the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was investig@@ ated in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chem@@ otherap@@ ies received strong or exc@@ essive trigger for n@@ au@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
the strong trigger for n@@ au@@ seas , the strong trigger for n@@ au@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed up to 57 % of the patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , exc@@ essive trigger for n@@ au@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed up to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission appointed Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a approval for the office of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : prevention of ac@@ ute n@@ au@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in severe n@@ autical @-@ borne chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy due to cancer illness .
the effic@@ acy of Alo@@ xi is used for prevention of n@@ au@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is induc@@ ed by a strong pol@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy by adding another Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron the col@@ on massage can pro@@ long , patients with an@@ am@@ nest@@ ian or@@ ip@@ ation should be monitored or monitored by a sub@@ ac@@ ute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is provided at the same time of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs , which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval extends to such an extension .
aside in connection with other chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics G@@ abe , Alo@@ xi shall not be used in the days after chemotherapy nor for prevention of n@@ au@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre @-@ clinical studies inhib@@ its pall@@ et@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhib@@ it against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmaceutical interaction between a one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , an CY@@ P2@@ D6 inhib@@ itors .
in a population based on a population based pharmaceutical inet@@ an analysis ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ o and R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and of CY@@ P2@@ D6 @-@ In@@ hib@@ itors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Chin@@ id@@ in , Ran@@ iti@@ din , R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Cle@@ arance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of pall@@ et@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ anc@@ ies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied to pregnant women , unless it is necessary to elim@@ inate the doctor &apos;s treated doctor .
clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe ad@@ verse events ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and or@@ char@@ ity ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions in the application ( burning , contrac@@ tion , complaints , and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage showed a similar potential of un@@ wanted events such as in other disp@@ ensing groups ; no dose of action relation@@ ships were observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the major distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis , however , is probably no effective therapy at a Alo@@ x@@ i- crossing .
in two random@@ ised double bl@@ ind@@ ings , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients who received a generally em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 m@@ g. of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7,3 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.3 hours ) was received intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 .
in a random@@ ised double bl@@ ind@@ study , 667 patients who received a strong em@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ cy@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients that were 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron that were intra@@ ven@@ ously given in day 1 .
results of clinical trials with moderate @-@ ogen@@ eous chemotherapy and the study are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induc@@ ed n@@ au@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are calculated on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron poss@@ esses the ability to block the isolation of the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and polar@@ ization in polar@@ ization and extend the duration of the action process .
the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers conducted the evaluation of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ v. admin@@ istered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0.75 and 2,25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the Conc@@ entr@@ ation Time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally used in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ - / kg in terms of healthy and cancer .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses was measured with 11 Ho@@ den@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured from the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration of 42 ± 34 % .
in terms of intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous m@@ ills of 0.25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) were compared with once intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous objec@@ tivity of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was measured after the one @-@ off period of 0.75 mg .
approximately 40 % are elim@@ inated by the kid@@ neys , and some 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites compared to the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron by less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abol@@ ization have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D6 and , in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination elim@@ ination of intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged active ingre@@ dient made around 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total physi@@ ology was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Cle@@ arance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver functional im@@ pair@@ ment the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination period and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but the reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects have been observed more than sufficient about the maximum human therap@@ eutic execution , which indicates a slight relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 . pre @-@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ onic channels , which can be involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and re@@ polar@@ ization and can pro@@ long the action capacity .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was given in about the 30@@ mn of therap@@ eutic exposure of human beings ) , which have been given every two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , inc@@ ar@@ ren@@ al disease ) and skin tumor , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechan@@ isms are not completely known , but because of the used high doses and da Alo@@ xi is used for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be low as for humans .
the holder of the author@@ ization must inform the European Commission on the plans for goods on the market concerning this decision .

in the study of patients with Hepatitis C the effic@@ acy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to 455 patients .
in the study was measured how many patients followed in 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns they have been exposed , the data for the stability of the active substance and the drug are not enough .
the number of patients with he@@ patitis C const@@ it@@ utes regarding the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease is ret@@ ard@@ ant with more patients than in the reference to the refer@@ ral care ; Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from this , the test was used to exam@@ ine the question in which the drug forms an immune reaction ( i.e. the body of body - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not suff@@ ici@@ ently valid@@ ated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cru@@ el infection ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or Schn@@ it@@ tw@@ unden ) , de@@ vi@@ ations and se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat inf@@ ections , det@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant St@@ aph@@ ylo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RS@@ A ) because al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of inf@@ ections may not be used .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin area should not exceed 2 % of body surface .
if the patient is not cancelled within two to three days , the doctor should exam@@ ine the patient and exam@@ ine alternative treatments in weak@@ ening .
it works by blo@@ cking the bacter@@ ial Rib@@ os@@ ome ( the pieces of the bacter@@ ial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhib@@ it the growth of bacteria .
the main indi@@ gn@@ ator of the effic@@ acy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was dis@@ continued after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients suffer from Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of infected m@@ alt@@ ars , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar contact : if the results were taken together with skin wound , about 90 % of the patients met both groups upon treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( e@@ ager @-@ filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or inf@@ ections that were prov@@ oked , or probably caused by M@@ RS@@ A , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an estimate at the office .
the Committee on Hum@@ arz@@ ne@@ im@@ ittel ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were we@@ igh to the risks of the following surface treatment : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , the infected small in@@ con@@ ations , depreci@@ ation or se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the merger of Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd . its approval for the use of Al@@ tar@@ go into the entire European Union .
patients in which two to three days are no better than that , once again , and an alternative therapy are considered to be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sen@@ sing or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be the treatment is broken , which sal@@ ts are carefully managed and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection are started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat inf@@ ections of which M@@ RS@@ A is known as an Er@@ re@@ ger ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies , the effic@@ acy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with inf@@ ections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant St@@ aph@@ ylo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RS@@ A ) were sufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment is no improvement or failure of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ian drug is not recommended .
because of the low plasma cutting , which have been achieved by human use on the ne@@ edy eyes or inf@@ ested surfaces , a clinical @-@ relevant inhib@@ ition in vi@@ vo has not been expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 According to the same period of 2 times a day 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be increased by 81 % .
due to the low @-@ system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ ages will not be considered to apply if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with the CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ sufficient in relation to the birth and the f@@ ö@@ t@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ial anti@@ bacter@@ ial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to prevent system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic .
in case of decision whether the St@@ ill continued / cancel or termin@@ ated the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go has to be completed , is between the benefit of the l@@ act@@ ness and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the wife .
in clinical studies of 2150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial skin inf@@ ections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect on the distribution site , which concerned about 1 % of patients .
an active effect of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of Ple@@ uro@@ mut@@ il@@ in , a substance which is isolated by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ cker@@ ian@@ us ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ cker@@ ian@@ us ) .
the action mechanism by Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhib@@ ition of the bacter@@ ial protein syn@@ thesis by interaction of the 50@@ S under@@ unit of the bacter@@ ial Rib@@ os@@ ome , which diff@@ ers from the bind@@ ings of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ act anti@@ bacter@@ ial substances .
data indicates that the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein are involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein , and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ ties and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase .
by binding at this connection of the P@@ uro@@ mut@@ il@@ ine within the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ ing , partial P @-@ ties inter@@ actions and prevent normal education of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub @-@ units .
if applicable to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is supposed to appear in at least some inf@@ ections should be target@@ ed by experts .
there were no differences in in vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of failure to the treatment of S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes should be considered as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ c@@ id@@ in ) .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adult was raised 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts daily below Oc@@ cl@@ usion on int@@ act and lower@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
from 516 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts received twice a day for 5 days on top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wo@@ unds , single plas@@ ia were obtained .
the sample took place on the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic absorption of a human application of 1 % ano@@ inting to 200 cm2 suggested skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhib@@ ition .

Amb@@ iri@@ x is used to protect he@@ patitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases caused by the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Amb@@ iri@@ x is applied within two doses of existing vacc@@ ine , where@@ by an protection against he@@ patitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Amb@@ iri@@ x can only be used when immun@@ ization is a low risk of he@@ patitis B infection and ensu@@ red that the two doses can be led to an end .
if a starting dose for he@@ patitis A or B can be desired , Amb@@ iri@@ x or other he@@ patitis A@@ - or -@@ B vacc@@ ine may be given .
vacc@@ ines are involved in bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can cause a si@@ ck@@ ness .
after a child received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens to be &quot; strange &quot; and anti@@ body .
Amb@@ iri@@ x contains the same components such as the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix adult and since 1997 approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix kids .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are admin@@ istered within three doses of existing vacc@@ ination .
because Amb@@ iri@@ x and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also supports as proof for the application of Amb@@ iri@@ x .
the main indi@@ gn@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children that had developed a month after the last injection a protective anti@@ body concentr@@ ations .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month intervals between two in@@ jec@@ tions .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of anti @-@ anti@@ body concentr@@ ations against he@@ patitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Amb@@ iri@@ x at a six @-@ month distance between the in@@ jec@@ tions was similar .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Amb@@ iri@@ x ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , app@@ et@@ ite def@@ iciency , pain , red@@ ness , red@@ ness , ti@@ red@@ ness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Amb@@ iri@@ x may react to patients who may have been sensitive to the active ingredients , one of other components or other omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. for author@@ ization of equipment of Amb@@ iri@@ x on the whole
the standard arm for gr@@ asp@@ ing with Amb@@ iri@@ x consists of two vacc@@ ines , where@@ by the first dose is given at the appointment of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection vacc@@ ination is desired for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combinations .
anti @-@ he@@ patitis B surface coatings on anti @-@ he@@ patitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ he@@ patitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ body values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet secured whether immun@@ oh@@ si@@ ent persons addressed to a he@@ patitis A@@ - vacc@@ ine as protection does not require a collection of investig@@ ational anti@@ bodies because it may also be protected by immune memory .
3 As for all in@@ jec@@ tors should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction after the substance of the vacc@@ ine it will always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against he@@ patitis B is necessary , the standard fl@@ oral pattern is recommended with combin@@ ing he@@ patitis A virus and 10 µg of combined he@@ patitis B surface finishing .
in case of det@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with dis@@ orders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ anti@@ body is achieved so that in these cases the gift of another vacc@@ ine may be required .
as an in@@ tram@@ usc@@ ous injection or in@@ tram@@ usc@@ ular administration in the Ges@@ ascular muscle could lead to a sub@@ tle imp@@ lic@@ ation , these in@@ jec@@ tions should be avoided .
in these cases , Amb@@ iri@@ x cannot be in@@ jected to hem@@ or@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ia or hem@@ ag@@ ile dys@@ function as it can occur in these cases following in@@ tram@@ usc@@ ular gift .
if Amb@@ iri@@ x in the second life year in the form of separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influ@@ enza type b @-@ vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ king @-@ m@@ ine @-@ vacc@@ ine was given to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ os@@ si@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ def@@ ect must be assumed that maybe no adequate immune response will be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ine doses of this form@@ ulation in adults , was the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , Mat@@ ri@@ er@@ itis , head@@ ache and fe@@ ver comparable with the frequency , which was observed in former thes@@ i@@ omer@@ ically and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ine form@@ ulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ine doses have been admin@@ istered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 up to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Amb@@ iri@@ x was compared to the 3 @-@ dose combinations .
only excep@@ tions were the higher frequency of pain and complex@@ ity on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination room Amb@@ iri@@ x , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Amb@@ iri@@ x at 50.@@ 7 % of the subjects who were compared to 3@@ 9,1 % for the subjects of a dose of 3 doses .
following the entire vacc@@ ine cycle , 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects who had arrived in Amb@@ iri@@ x were vacc@@ inated for pain , compared with the 3 @-@ dose combinations had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combinations .
however , the overall frequency of Mat@@ eness was comparable to a pro@@ band in height ( i.e. above all vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9,6 % of the subjects who received Amb@@ iri@@ x compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ dose combinations .
the frequency of pron@@ oun@@ ced pain and sin@@ cer@@ ity was small and comparable to the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination was observed .
in compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the occurr@@ ence of local reaction and general actions in the Amb@@ iri@@ x@@ group was comparable with the 3 @-@ dose combinations using 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ patitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined he@@ patitis B surface treatment .
but for the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Amb@@ iri@@ x a frequent occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not reported per prog@@ am .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines , which have severe side effects during 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ines with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ patitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combined he@@ patitis B surface an@@ tigen , was statist@@ ically un@@ able .
clinical trials that were conducted in clinical studies at the age of 1 to 15 years , were the ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ver@@ sion@@ ate for anti @-@ HA@@ V 99.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 of the dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
the rates of service for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , taken in the month 6 ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study that was conducted in 12- as well as 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses of Amb@@ iri@@ x and 147 received the basic combined fuel with three doses .
at the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ity was recy@@ cl@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ u@@ tions@@ rates ( SP in the table below ) against he@@ patitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 according to match of the 3 @-@ dose classification .
the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , vacc@@ ines were either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ patitis A virus and 10@@ µg of combined he@@ patitis B surface treatment .
at persons who were between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ anti@@ bodies could be trac@@ ed over a minimum of 24 months following the immun@@ ization with Amb@@ iri@@ x in 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination .
the immune reaction in this study was comparable to both anti@@ gens to be combined with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ pat@@ it@@ is@@ - A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined he@@ patitis B surface treatment in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study by 12- and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ anti@@ bodies were similar to immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .

the he@@ patitis A virus is usually transferred by vir@@ us@@ hal@@ ous food and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as by bathing in due to wast@@ e@@ water .
you can feel very tired , a dark ur@@ ine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Amb@@ iri@@ x cannot protect completely before an infection with he@@ patitis A@@ - or he@@ patitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ine was completed with 2 doses .
if you have infected / your child before the ab@@ sur@@ ing of both vacc@@ ine doses have been infected with he@@ patitis A@@ - or he@@ patitis B virus ( though you feel un@@ comfortable or ill / you feel ) can not prevent a vacc@@ ine a dis@@ order .
protection against other inf@@ ections , which cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of a he@@ patitis A@@ - or he@@ patitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If you have shown an allergic reaction to Amb@@ iri@@ x or any part of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can manif@@ ested through ju@@ icy skin fl@@ avo@@ ids , re@@ spir@@ atory or spir@@ acy of singing or tongue . • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against he@@ patitis A or he@@ patitis B in your child . • if you / your child has severe infection with a fe@@ ver .
• If you would like to have a protection against he@@ patitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled transfer of the second vacc@@ ine ) .
with a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ine , the doctor will give you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with ambul@@ ance .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 in@@ jec@@ tions of a combined he@@ patitis B / he@@ patitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced sal@@ ary of an effective he@@ patitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined he@@ patitis B surface anti@@ gens .
the second vacc@@ ine dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective components is usually admin@@ istered for a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination before termination of the vacc@@ ine series .
sometimes , Amb@@ iri@@ x is suffering from serious ble@@ eding dys@@ function , under the skin and not in your muscles , if you are pregnant or interru@@ pted the disease in your own body or a treatment in your own body .
Amb@@ iri@@ x can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be needed to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ine is .
21 Do you take your doctor if you / your child may take another medicine / take ( including those that you may have been vacc@@ inated without dis@@ closure ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or im@@ pregn@@ ated bul@@ ins ( anti@@ bodies ) have been given or this in the near future is planned .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not enough and the person is not protected against one or both he@@ patitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine should be given at the same time with Amb@@ iri@@ x , should be connected to separate places and as possible as possible limb@@ s .
if Amb@@ iri@@ x should be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is probably that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine is still enough .
usually , Amb@@ iri@@ x pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not admin@@ istered , but it is strongly necessary that they are vacc@@ inated both against he@@ patitis A and he@@ patitis B vacc@@ ines .
important information on certain other components of Amb@@ iri@@ x Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) before you / your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

based on the data , which have become known since the first approval of the entry , the CH@@ MP has left the view that the benefits risk ratio for Amb@@ iri@@ x remains positive .
however , since Amb@@ iri@@ x was posted only in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited to the small public ex@@ position .

F@@ oss@@ aps can also cause loss of loss of loss of loss in blood , de@@ pression , stim@@ ul@@ ness , ear@@ ache , loss , loss , flav@@ ouring , n@@ au@@ sea , exc@@ essive , skin r@@ ash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human@@ medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that ammon@@ aps prev@@ ented in patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the urea cycle to high ammonia values .
ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , because on the order of the condition at the time of approval , limited information can be submitted to this medicine .
the deployment is indicated in all patients with which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ stick is already manif@@ ested in the new@@ born ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late manif@@ est form ( in@@ complete enz@@ ym@@ es manif@@ ested ) , an indication of the application where in the history is a hy@@ iph@@ ate po@@ ze@@ ph@@ al@@ opath@@ y .
for babies , for children who are not able to sw@@ allow tablets to sw@@ allow or for patients with g@@ orges of AM@@ MO@@ NG is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually by taking the protein tolerance and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake of the patients .
according to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and for growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early manif@@ est lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ thes@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ ine uc@@ cin@@ ate def@@ iciency have to get arg@@ in@@ ine in a doses of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ O@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with g@@ orges , as a risk for the emer@@ gence of est@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets are not given immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dosage .
therefore , AM@@ 3D@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as with sodium re@@ tention and oil recovery only with caution .
since met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kid@@ ney disease .
the importance of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous bill of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at a very high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) there was a slow@@ down of ne@@ ur@@ onal multip@@ lic@@ ation and increased loss of ne@@ ur@@ ons .
there were also a re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant m@@ aturing of cere@@ br@@ al syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional ner@@ ve damage in the brain and thus dis@@ ability of brain growth .
it could not be detected if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is separated by humans into the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ O@@ PS during bre@@ ast@@ feeding is inde@@ xed ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical studies with AM@@ 3D@@ PS , at 56 % of patients at least an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) came out with at least 78 % of this un@@ wanted events that it was not related to AM@@ 3D@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occas@@ ionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ opath@@ y associated with l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ id@@ osis , pan@@ cy@@ to@@ pen@@ y , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dosing took an average dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) with an acc@@ id@@ ental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
this symptoms occur with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an dos@@ si@@ limit of ne@@ ur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity in one intra@@ ven@@ ous lam@@ ination of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abol@@ ish active connection which is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ ylene acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ Glut@@ amine , which is separated by the kid@@ neys .
compar@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric is seen by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ orders of the urea @-@ cycle can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ an@@ yr@@ ate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .
it is important that diagnosis is early enough and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the forecast of early manif@@ est form of disease with occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ro@@ wed was almost always inf@@ usion , and the disease carried out even in tre@@ ating with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids in the first year of life .
by hem@@ oph@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ate gr@@ ate and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born during post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and was treated prior to the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic En@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ opath@@ y , but even in these patients , it was with time for many intel@@ lec@@ tual dis@@ abilities or other neuro@@ logical defects .
in patients with a late manif@@ est form of the disease ( including female patients with h@@ eter@@ o@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ ium @-@ man@@ rock ) , which were treated from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic En@@ ze@@ ph@@ al@@ opath@@ y and then perman@@ ently has been treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a prot@@ ein@@ ed diet . the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and in some patients a further deter@@ i@@ oration of neuro@@ logical state can occur .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ox@@ idi@@ zed to Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ox@@ idi@@ zed , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in the liver and kid@@ ney enz@@ ym@@ atic by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ Glut@@ amine .
concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were treated according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in patients with dis@@ orders of the urea @-@ cycle , and rep@@ lic@@ ted gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous gifts of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measuring plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ cy@@ c@@ ous dys@@ function or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ec@@ table by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the next morning .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate inter@@ con@@ es were five times higher than the first gifts .
differenti@@ ation The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no cl@@ astic effects ( test 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either by oral ( inf@@ ants and children who can take no more tablets , or patients with g@@ orges ) or over a gast@@ ric acid .
according to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg and for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine , and ser@@ um protein in plasma should be kept inside the normal area .
in patients who suffer from an early manif@@ est lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ thes@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to the maximum daily dosage .
if R@@ att@@ od were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( active met@@ abo@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of Hir@@ n@@ rin@@ de .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ opath@@ y associated with l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ id@@ osis , pan@@ cy@@ to@@ pen@@ y , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
compar@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine to urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on studies on the discharge of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine to patients with dis@@ orders of the ur@@ inary life can be assumed that for each gram , the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ an@@ yr@@ ate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ Glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment , and in some patients a further deter@@ i@@ oration of neuro@@ logical state can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking measuring plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability , the patient can maintain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this case the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient needs to be received via a probe , AM@@ 3D@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the nitrogen content of proteins in the body , not ex@@ crete after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are using laboratory tests , you must take the doctor , that you have to influence AM@@ MO@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not a pres@@ cription drug .
during bre@@ ast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MO@@ PS because the medicine could pass into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , wor@@ r@@ ying , head@@ ache , taste problems , dis@@ ori@@ ent@@ ity , memory problems and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you set up one of these symptoms in contact with your doctor or with the emergency acceptance of your hospital in the introduction of an appropriate treatment .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ 3D@@ PS , please take the appropriate dose once you can with the next meal .

Ang@@ i@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example at inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest is with var@@ ying strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( a form of pain in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
in ang@@ i@@ ox , ang@@ i@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients , which is admin@@ istered to a higher dose and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contri@@ bute to the heart in patients with ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac disease to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
almost 14 000 patients took part in the main study of the treatment of ACS grade , with the effect of Ang@@ i@@ ox in sole gift or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhib@@ itor ( G@@ PI ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patients often became a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery , to prevent a lock ) and they received additionally other medicines for prevention of blood cl@@ ots , such as dec@@ o@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was Ang@@ i@@ ox - with or without an issue of G@@ PI - during pre@@ vent@@ ing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or prec@@ inc@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year totally effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who sub@@ jected to one PCI was ang@@ i@@ ox over to all indicators just as effective in severe ble@@ eding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
Ang@@ i@@ ox must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against b@@ ival@@ ry , other she@@ pher@@ ds or one of the other components .
it may not be applied in patients who had recently had a ble@@ eding , and in people with strong blood pressure or serious inc@@ idents or cardi@@ ac infection .
the Committee on Hum@@ arz@@ ne@@ im@@ ittel ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ang@@ i@@ ox during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in is .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the approval of the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd with approval for the use of ang@@ i@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ bel@@ far@@ kt ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency stop or if an early intervention is fore@@ seen .
the recommended starting dose of ang@@ i@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is carried out in another row a PCI , an additional pin of 0.5 mg / kg should be given to the inf@@ usion for the duration of the pressure to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion rate at 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours can be included .
immediately prior to the procedure , a pin rate should be admin@@ istered by 0.5 mg / kg followed by an usion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
the recommended dose of ang@@ i@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of a 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift of Ang@@ i@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT is short@@ ened to 5 minutes ) to less than 225 seconds , a second pin of bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ const@@ it@@ uted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully admin@@ istered before the application and quickly admin@@ istered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg Inf@@ usion@@ sd@@ osis is given right .
in patients with moderate kid@@ ney restri@@ ction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which can be sub@@ jected to one PCI ( whether with bal@@ kon@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second pin dose of 0.3 mg / kg is admin@@ istered to test the fact that ACT 5 minutes later .
in patients with moderate kid@@ ney compensation , which was included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) that was included , the ACT value was 5 minutes after completion of the bor@@ der@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kid@@ ney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients , ang@@ i@@ ox is inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with ang@@ i@@ ox can be derived only 30 minutes after completion of intra@@ ven@@ ous ass@@ par@@ in or 8 hours following completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous fer@@ ment of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• the well @-@ known hyper@@ tension against the active ingre@@ dient or an increased blood risk caused by a dis@@ order of hem@@ ost@@ atic disease and / or ir@@ rever@@ sible pul@@ sion system . • severe un@@ control@@ l@@ able hyper@@ tension ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) , and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients .
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of ble@@ eding , especially if B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is admin@@ istered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if using PCI @-@ patients under@@ take number of ble@@ edings on ar@@ ter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ations , in patients who under@@ go a per@@ k@@ ut@@ anen Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment , may occur everywhere .
in patients who are inde@@ struc@@ ted and treated with b@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should ensure a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standard debt ratio ) to ensure that the value is reached after re@@ placing the treatment with b@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again before the treatment of existing level .
starting from the knowledge about the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( par@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tica or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ti@@ ers ) can be assumed that these drugs will increase blood vessels .
the combination of the ival@@ ro@@ ud@@ ine combined with plat@@ elets or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ Web can be used regularly in any case .
in terms of impact on the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , is in@@ sufficient ( see Section 5.3 ) .

the following information on ad@@ verse events are based on data of a clinical study with bal@@ ival@@ ry in 6000 patients who sub@@ jected to a PCI .
both in the ab@@ ival@@ ry group as well as in patients treated with He@@ par@@ in treated patients and patients over 65 years more often to un@@ wanted events than in male or younger patients .

the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported under practical use in practice and are classified according to system operations in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , tre@@ ating the treatment with ab@@ ival@@ ry immediately to v@@ om@@ iting and monitoring the patient with regard to the signs of a ble@@ eding .
Ang@@ i@@ ox contains a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ in@@ inhib@@ itor , which is either the cat@@ aly@@ tic Center as well as at the An@@ ion@@ ite region of TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N , regardless of whether TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N is tied in the liquid phase or similar .
the binding of ab@@ ival@@ ro@@ ud@@ in to TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N , and therefore its effect , is rever@@ sible because TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N becomes slowly out@@ dated , thereby creating the function of the active centre of TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N .
moreover , through B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with ser@@ um of patients with ser@@ um of patients in the past , induc@@ ed th@@ ro@@ mb@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ ed thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( HIT / HI@@ TTS ) had come to in@@ duce a plat@@ elets .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is applied for the treatment of adults , ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is in@@ jected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , in@@ jected the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or as a continuous inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease , in which the body does not produce sufficient ins@@ ulin for regulation of glucose level ( sugar ) or ins@@ ulin .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly from Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter factor has as a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was applied in the application in combination with a durable in@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , if the ins@@ ulin had not been working in@@ operative , Ap@@ id@@ ra was investig@@ ated in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ gn@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the change of the substance of the substance gly@@ cem@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0,14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0,14 % in ins@@ ulin delivery .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % for human normal ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra must possibly be adapted if it is admin@@ istered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the San@@ of@@ i Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH a approval for the transport of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall or cont@@ amination or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion in the areas of abdominal muscles .
because of the reduced glucose load capacity and reduced in@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin need to be reduced in patients with restri@@ ction of the liver function .
any changes of the effects , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin @-@ typ@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ inc@@ del@@ etes , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin level .
3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or break@@ through of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can cause hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ abe@@ tic w@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ osis ; these states are potenti@@ ally life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the conversion of a patient to another In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp or a ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be processed under strict medical supervision and may require a change to dosage .
the time of occurr@@ ence of hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin and thus can change when switching the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase inc@@ lin@@ ation to hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia , the oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic , ang@@ i@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enz@@ y@@ me ( ACE ) inhib@@ itors , ec@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ lin , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ a , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ate , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ anti@@ biot@@ ics .
in addition , under the effect of symp@@ ath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics like Bet@@ ab@@ id@@ in , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in , and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ dering equivalent , be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies show no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if ins@@ ulin is out@@ lined in human breast milk , but generally ins@@ ulin is neither into the breast milk , nor is it absor@@ b@@ able after oral use .
in the following clinical trials are listed in clinical trials ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; ) : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occas@@ ionally : ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency at review date ) are not dis@@ appreci@@ ated ) .

Lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is incor@@ rec@@ t to change in@@ jec@@ tions within the injection range , in the consequ@@ ence a lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at injection .
severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia with consciousness can be treated with in@@ tram@@ usc@@ ular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0,5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a doctor , or intra@@ ven@@ ous gift by glucose .
after one glucose in@@ jec@@ tion , the patient must be monitored in a hospital to avoid the prim@@ itive matter of hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia and similar ep@@ iso@@ des .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood glucose levels by stim@@ ulating glucose absorption ( especially by sk@@ el@@ eton muscles and fat ) as well as through the inhib@@ ition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ est@@ be of In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs faster and shorter than with hu@@ ff@@ man@@ e normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus ar@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a propor@@ tional glucose level effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more propor@@ tional rise of the glu@@ cos@@ metic effect , such as Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has dou@@ bly effective action occurs as normal human ins@@ ulin and sco@@ red the complete glu@@ cos@@ metic effect around 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
data from the data was evi@@ dent that during an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ ge@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with human@@ ised normal ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was cooked in 2 minutes before meal , was given a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ge@@ al control as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which has been given 2 minutes before the meal .
if in@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , there will be a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as indicated by human normal ins@@ ulin , which is 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin in@@ ulin in G@@ abe : 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - before ) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal ins@@ ulin , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal , which was given before a meal ( figure 1B ) before a meal ( figure 1B ) .
