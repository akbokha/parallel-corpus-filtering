<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Legal Notification (EPAR), in which the studies will be assessed as the Committee on Humanmedicinal Products (CHMP) has been assessed according to recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package file (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish to read more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to inclusion (1mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Create thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things that are not available), Misstrust and madness; • Bipolar I-disturbance, a psychic disorder in which patients definded with periods of normal atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for prevention of Japanese episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied to fast control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral ingestion is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to inclusion or melting of patients, which make the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines that same as Abilify should be extracted, the dose of abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impaired the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical agents that allow the communication of nerve cells each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is believed primarily as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine can play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disturbance to normalize the activity of the brain, which means psychological or manic symptoms and prevented them.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify that prevent reoccurrence of symptoms was investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which was compared to increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was reported about twelve weeks in 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, which were stabilised to 160 patients with whom the symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection solution was found in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disturbance that were increased to increased unrest, with the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients achieved using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body takes the melting, and absorb the solution to absorb absorb.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution of patients, Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg got a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was executed in four of five short term studies of manic symptoms more than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify preventor until 74 weeks was more effective than placebo-occurring Japanese episodes before previously treated patients and if it was administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses had also reduced effective than placebo and were similar effective as a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for insertion (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (inflication), tremor and exhaustion (increased saline production), blood pressure and exhaustion, ruthiness (sleep changes) and anxiety (sleep changes) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Humanmedicinal products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and for the prevention of a new manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazio, versus the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the fast control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manizophrenia or patients with manizophrenia, if an orale therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the European Commission of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. to submit Abilify to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILITY is indicated for the treatment of moderate episodes of the Bipolar-I- Stations and for the prevention of a new episode of patients who had predominantly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILITY is 10 or 15 mg / day for a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proved, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILITY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">ABILITY OF ABILITY in treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- Disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initialion when clinical factors can justify this justification (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor consists of combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicide behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an antimental therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disturbance no increased suiciality of risk is caused by means of anti-antipsychotics compared with other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases, cardiovascular diseases, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure medicinal products) or hypertension (including packages and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials that were a year or less digested, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol induced dyskinesie.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with ABILITY patients treated signs and symptoms of Spätdyskinesie should occur, the dose should reduce or interrupt the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient is developing and symptoms developed on a mns clever, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be removed including ABILITY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, in patients with anti-fanatization, it should be used in the medical history or near the conditions that are used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years of patients with psychosis associated with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease patients who were treated with the Alzheimer's disease, an increased risk is compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of those studies, a study of fixed doses, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted drovascular events observed with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases, associated with ketoazidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic treatments, including ABILITY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemic data related unwanted events with ABILITY and other atypical antipsychotic treatments treated patients who allow direct depression.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polypheny, polyphagy and weakness) are observed in patients with diabetes mellitus, or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be observed regularly in terms of deteriety of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophred patients and in patients with bipolarity, the application of antipsychotics, with which weight gain is observed as a side effect, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines referred to as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not relevant as clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="52">When CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolism can result in a high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma cutting of AID D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you take into consideration the common Gabe of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, the potential benefits should exceed the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protein-inhibitors, must have similar effects and therefore should be similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors the dosage of ABILITY should be stimulated to the dose level before beginning of accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered with a moderate increase in the Cripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg are non-significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometamorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C19 (Dextrometa) and 3A4 (Dextrometamorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patient should be smoother to draw their doctor if she are pregnant or trying to plan a pregnancy during the treatment of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation in the animal, this medicine may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless you can justify the potential risk for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics the patients should be warned, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects are more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of listed side effects are defined according to the following criteria: commonly (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled cross-term study of 52 weeks, patients with AID Inzidenz (25.8%), including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinesie were treated, compared with patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was under placebo-treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients suffering from Cripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Interim episodes of Bipolar I-Stacy - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS-23,5% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under semidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS reached 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazol-treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters were occurred, yielded no significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the Cpk (creatine-Phosphokinase), generally well-temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3,5% of patients treated with astiprazol treated patients, compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">In connection with anti-psychological therapy, malignant neuroleptic syndrome, insomdyskinesie and crampfanaccidents, involunwanted drovascular events and increased mortality in elderly people, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, accidental or deliberate overdose with agripiprazio have been observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg, and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information about the effectiveness of a detecatalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; it is unlikely that hematalysis occur in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, since Aripiprazole has a high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazio in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I interference above the combination of a partial agist effect on Dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1- receptors and antagonist effect is mediated on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, the precipotominol showed a high affinity to damine D2- and D3-receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrendering and for Histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition of Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks at healthy volunteers showed a dosed decrease in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 recipe, at NuCLEUS caudatus and on the turnoons.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled course studies (4 to 6 weeks) in a positive or negative symptoms in comparison to placebo showed a statistically significant improvement of the mental symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a semidol controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of Responsible patients received a response to the study medication that were similar in both groups (Cripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring range defined as secondary education programs, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depression-scale, showed an significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed an significantly higher reduction in return rate that was at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study was included in line with schizophrenia in line with schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluation level) in significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I-Stacy showed an antiebo-superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I interference in case of placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboarding and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I-disturbance, with or without mental characteristics, showed comparable effectiveness in week 3 and an accounting effect that was comparable to lithium or semidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol showed a comparative proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or semidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks in patients with chronic or mixed episepisode, with or without psychological characteristics, which involves more than 2 weeks not on lithic and valproat monotherapy, which involve partial effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extention phase in some 74 weeks before Randomization before Randomization had achieved a remission in regard to the prevention of a bipolar recovery, predominantly in case of prevention of a case in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the deflection and hydroxycontroller, the N-Dealkyard is catalyzed by the N-Dealkyard.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshalborg is nearly 75 hours for agripiprazol at extensive metabolism over CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects, also showed no sexually dependent effects in the pharmacokinetic examination.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics showed no evidence on clinically significant differences in regard to ethnical ethics or the influence of the smoking in the Pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney disease compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugliances class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the Pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional trials for safety harmacology, toxicity is repeated, reproduction, reproduction, and the Canoded potential no special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only for doses or exposure, which have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans during clinical use only limited or no meaning.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decline of Zoledron acid concentration after 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma centric against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by Cytochrome P450-enzyme metabolic substances is unlikely to metabolized because Zoledronic is not metabolized because of a weak or even more direct and / or irreversibler, metabolic inhibitor of P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">For special patient working groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the creatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine Clearance and was in the 64 investigated patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">It emerges that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function up to 35 ml / min are no dose customizable of the Zoledron acid.</seg>

<seg id="751">In addition, it can be applied to metformin patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfa drugs or insulin, the previous dose of sulfa drugs can be maintained, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulfa drugs may be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be enhanced better and the blood sugar levels decreases, which means that type 2 diabetes is better.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripleotherapy has been studied; in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa slump, in addition they received either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, concentration of a substance (glyceric hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease of the HbA1c value, which allows you to reduce blood glucose levels when using doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplement study, the effect of the added treatment of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and sulfa assets increased by 0,94%, while the addition of placebo was decreasing by 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin had been studied in 289 patients, proved to insulin inulin, a decrease of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 12% in the patients who were additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory tract, weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to militia).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can be applied or used in patients, perhaps hypersensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, in case of patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic Ketoazidosis (high glucose levels - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the context of a monotherapy (with all use) is to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin patients with which Metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the approval of the European Commission, Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited covering approval of accounts in the EU's entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on a page the marking "15" and on the other side the label "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and in which metals is inadequate, as due to contraction or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For application of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients that caused by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. at the earliest heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin to increase the treatment with the lowest rate of available dose and increase the dose stages.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in symptoms and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or eyards, especially those with reduced bargain reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">The patients should be seen on signs and symptoms of insufficiency, weight gain and oils, when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing macroasculular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output levels (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the norm) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used for Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="772">When the ALT-ror has been increased to the 3 times of the upper limit of the norm, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient has developed specifically to prove the dysfunction, vomiting, vomiting, vomiting, fatigue, appetite, appetite, and / or dark Harn, are the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment is continued with Pioglitazon, should be led until the intention of the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dosed weight gain is detected, which can be stirring in some cases with liquid tention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a herodies, a minor reduction in central hemoglobines (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) is increased.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed with Pioglitazon in patients under Metformin (relative reduction in the disease by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.6-4.1%) and for a minor dimension in patients under sulfonylharnels and insulin (relative reduction in the hemorglobalins by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitive therapies consists of patients who receive Pioglitazon as oral dual or triple-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dossier hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, under the treatment of Thiazolatindions, including Pioglitazon, including a rejection or deterioration of a diabetic Makulaödems report with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between the taking of Pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaödems should be aware of the possibility of a macular degnity if patients should be informed of disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmology should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of messages unwanted events regarding bones from randomised controlled trials, double-blind clinical studies have been treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence of 1.9 fractures were treated with Pioglitazon for 100 patients per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="783">During the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, rates are treated with pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patient who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to be a pregnancy or this, the treatment is to be used (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for examines the interaction effects have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the Pharmacokinetics or Pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines prescribed by these enzymes, e.g. orale contraventiva, cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA reductions are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC from Pioglitazon to 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulting in a decrease of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment with Pioglitazon, which reduces hyperinsulinememia in the pregnancy, and increased insulin-resistance to the maternal substrates and reduces the availability of metabolic rate.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; commonly used &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from present data invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">This lead to a temporary change in turmoors and fractive index of the lens, as well as for other hypoglycous substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Ange came across the triple the upper limit of the norm, but less often than in comparison groups under Metformin or sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study of patients with existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pioglitazon was about 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon is resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since market launch, seldom has been reported using cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon, more common when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or people with heart failure at the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of messages from randomised clinical trials included in randomised controlled trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative media treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">During a period of 3.5 years, rates are based on 44 / 870 (5.1%) patients treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) patients treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day, over four days, then 180 mg / day have no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears above a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator of Activated Receptor-γ), which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitive vility of liver, fat and skeleton cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucositics in the case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as a monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the treatment of therapeutic effects (defined by HbA1c ≥ 8,0% according to the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood sugar monitoring (defined by HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was upheld by Pioglitazon in 69% of the patients (above 50% of the patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo analysis more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar have been randomly insufficient for insulin insufficient, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared with the patients who were still only insulin, treated with Pioglitazon treated group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinine Quotiations in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg) was tested in a small, over 18 weeks for type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo a reduction in plasma-triglyceride and the free fatty acids and a rise in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as slightly marked, however, clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon in comparison to Plazebo, Metformin or Gliclazide reduces the total plasmic glyzeros and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to Plazebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while under Metformin and Gliclazide reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the shy triglyceride, but also improved also the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this also improved on the triglyceride absorption and also on the hepatotic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular outcome study, were randomised to type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macroasculular disease in either period up to 3.5 years in addition to either existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or Placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly absorbated, with the peak concentration of Pioglitazon in the plasma for 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">This basis corresponds to the effectiveness of M-IV for efficacy in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimally true.</seg>
<seg id="813">In intervention studies, Pioglitazon could not be detected, that Pioglitazon had no relevant effect on the Pharmacokinetics or Pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or decreases the plasma cutting of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive Pioglitazon in humans the markers was mainly found in the fender (55%) and to a minor dimension in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination cycle time of immutable pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolites is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma cutting of Pioglitazon and his metabolites are lower than in patients with reduced renal function compared to healthy volunteers, but resemble the pathogenic clearisation of the motherons.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys to repeat PlasmaVolume enlarging with hemophilia, anaemia and reversible excentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the treatment with Pioglitazone, which reduces hyperinsulinemy and increased insulinized resistance to the maternal substrates and thus reduces the availability of metabolic rate.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), hyperplasia (male and female rats) were induced in male rats (male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-friendly polyposis (FAP) the treatment performed with two other thiazolxindions to an increased frequency of columns.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on a page the mark "30" and on the other side the label "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence of 1.9 fractures were treated with Pioglitazon for 100 patients per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="824">During the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, rates are treated with pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patient who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin each with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinine Quotiations in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the shy triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which is in addition to the triglyceride absorption and also on the heygliceride absorption and also on the heygliceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing, which was lacking a combination of the overall mortality, non-killing myocardial infarction, groamputation and precincarization of the arteries, laying the results close that with the taking of Pioglitazon no arcardiovascular long-time risks are related.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on a page the mark "45" and on the other side the label "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of messages from randomised clinical studies, double-blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,400 patients who received with Pioglitazon and showed an increased incidence of bone brothers in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">During the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, rates are treated with pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patient who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the shy triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which is in addition to the triglyceride absorption and also on the hepatinated triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="864">Actraphane was performed in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in whom the pancreas can produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is not able to use insulin effective.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study occurred after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glyceric hemoglobin (HbA1c), which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease of the HbA1c-mirror, which indicates that the blood glucose levels were significantly decreased like with another Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients that may react hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (DNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane might be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines referred to in the blood sugar (the complete list is to be removed from packages).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Humanmedicinal Products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane were outweigh in the treatment of diabetes, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted its approval by the European Union of Novo Nordisk A / S for authorization of Actraphane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily when a quick initiating effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle has to be lowered under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose can be clearly improved through an intensive insulin therapy, hypoglycemia should change and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any alteration in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (rapid acting, biphasian, long acting insulin, insulin or insulin injections) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA compared with insulin origin) may result in a change to dose.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the switching to Actraphane is required to be a dose adaptable, it may be necessary during the first dose or months following the changeover to changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients who occurred hypoglycic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin had reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travelling all over time zones, the patient should be pointed out to obtain the advice of his physician, since such travels may be taken and taken as insulin and meals at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy taking into account and surveyed his patients to another of them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Solicted hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a non-sufficient diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemia can lead to consciousness and / or crampicially caused by temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system occasionally - periphere neuropathy a rapid concern of blood glucose monitoring can be connected with complaints that are considered acute painful neuropathy and normally reversible.</seg>

<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Gelegta, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions, itats, sweating, gastrointestinal disturbances, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycemia can be evolved in: • Leaving hypoglycemia can be treated by the oral infusion of glucose or sugar-containing foodstuffs.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics are therefore always treated with sweets, sweets, biscuits or sugar refinement of glucose levels. • Serious hypoglycemia should be treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0,5 to 1.0 mg) by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum activity will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the whole duration of the activity is up to 24 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunossirational therapy and treatment of transplantation therapy should be carried out using this medicine or changes in immune-suppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically releasing the systemic exposition of Tacrolimus, this may lead to transplants or increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or excess baggage.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacptus formulation and regulate the corresponding daily dosage; formulation of formulation or regime should only be performed under the engaging control of an experienced medical treatment (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In consequence of a switch to alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug, and appropriate dosages must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposition of Tactelimus will remain.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of abstraction and tolerability in individual and on blood levels (see below "recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After upgrading from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus Talmirror should be controlled from the switch and over two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposure, measured as a Talent level, with both formulations both for both kidney and transforming patients were comparable.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus Talmirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposition in the immediate effect of transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As Tacroica is a substance with low clearders, an adaptation of the Advagraf can take several days until the steady State reaches.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Dosages countinylaxis of transplantation prophylaxis assisted the oral Advograf therapy should start with 0,20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift of the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosages can be required later, as the Pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus may change in the course of stabilisation of patients after the transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosages recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis assisted the oral Advograf therapy should start with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift of the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be provided twice daily dosage of prograf capsules at one time daily intake of Advagraf. thus, this conversion has to be taken in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a switch from other immunohsiva on Advagraf a day must begin the treatment with the recommended dose of liver and liver transplantation recommended for the prophylaxis of the transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant For adult patients who are converted to Advagraf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplantation was probably non-clinical experience with Advagraf with lung, pancreas and darmtransplanted patients in an oral initiating dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and by intestinal transplantation was 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adapts in special patient-groups associated with reduced liver function for maintaining blood talents in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with heavy liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function when kidney function exercised no influence on the Pharmacokinetics of Tactelimus, can be assumed that a dose is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to nephrotoxic Potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular mining of serum circles) is recommended to calculation the Kreatininc.ance and monitoring of the urinary volume.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Transfer of Ciclosporin on Advagraf For the conversion of a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see section 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the whole blood levels in the whole blood The dose should be based on the clinical assessment of abstraction and tolerability in individual incident of whole blood Tacrolimus Talent controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to conduct the tacrolimus talent level during the first two weeks following transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood supply levels of Tacrolimus should also change after shifting prograf to Advagraf, Dosissing, amendments to immortal therapy or at the same term of substances which the Tacrolimus full blood concentration could be controlled (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with low Clearance, adjustments the dose may need to have several days to steady State.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley view is not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the rate level of Tacroica usually lies in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplants in the field of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for garnish and cordial-transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac transplantation were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to difficult undesirable events, including transplants effects or other side effects that can occur in a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacptus formulation and regulate the corresponding daily dosage; formulation of formulation or regime should only be performed under the engaging control of an experienced medical treatment (see section 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplants of disease, which are proven to other immunossiva as a therapist, there are no clinical data for retardly formulation advances.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In childhood prophylaxis assistants with adult heart transplantation and transplants in childsurgery are still no clinical data for the retardly formulation advances before.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interaction effects, which can lead to an approach of single-oxidation levels in the blood and weakening of the effect of Tacrolimus, the ingestation of herbal supplements (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies may be avoided during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimusi concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a tomdiomyopathy was able to observe the chamber or septum hypertrophies that can also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors which increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are an already existing cardiac disease, hypertension, kidney disease, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid load and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like with other immunohsiva, the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of comparable clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients suffering from Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headaches, changes, consciousness and aspiration should indicate a radiological study (e.g).</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of drugs or herbal remedy that are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can increase the metabolism of Tacroica and thus reduce blood levels of tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimusum blood levels in the same time of substances that can monitor the CYP3A abolism, and clarify the Tactelimus dosage for maintaining uniform concentration camps accordingly (see section 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetiken showed that the increase of blood levels is mainly from the elevated oral bioavailability of Tactelimus, due to the inhibition of the gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute disresponsican, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be metabolished by psychP3A4, whose metabolism can impair.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacroica construct the Clearance of steroid contraceptiva and thus increase the hormonal exposure, making decisions about overimaging action is particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus may reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazon to extend their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of investigations on transplants patient provide increased risk of unwanted events in comparison to other immunosuressiva with regard to the course and result of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposition a monitoring of the newborns on eventual injurious effects of Tacrolimus (especially concerning its effect on kidneys) is recommended.</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of FR-Virus-related nephropathy and JC virus-associated progressive superfencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients under immunosuresins therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant Neoplasmas including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin cancer in conjunction with the treatment of Tactelimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasmaprotein can be adopted that Tactelimus cannot dialytic.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Active mechanism and pharmacic effects on molecular levels should accompany the effects of Tacrolimus due to its binding to a cytosolastic protein (FKBP12) that is responsible for the enrichment of the coupling within the cell.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcient-dependent inhibition of T-cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphokin genes.</seg>

<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute transplant in which there was 6 months (57,7% versus 45,8%), and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%), with the unemployed people of the Tacrolimus group greater (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndroms were significantly lower with the tacptus treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancrease transplantation was carried out a multicore trial with oral prograf was undertaken to 205 patients who were simultaneously engaged in a pancreas and transplantation based on a randomised procedure Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (by protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was subsequently said to achieve the targeted talent level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study conducted in 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multiviszeral transplants) showed up 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for the early detection of epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV-infections, bone marriages of Tacrolimus, lead to talents between 10 and 15 ng / ml, and latest transplant transplantation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematric rites and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the untreated City of Tacrolimus, or involve a result of inhibitors of metabolism to be responsible for the higher Clearance-rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This lets conclude that Tactelimus is nearly completely metabolized, whereby the excretion is mainly effected by the gall.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dose and frequency of application set up whether advances will be used for the treatment of bleeding or preventing bleeding in surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII, lack of bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles, or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced as a method of combined DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene (DNA) which is empowering to the formation of the human mind factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advent is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is similar to it, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them one study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug may be examined for prevention of bleeding and surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the effectiveness of advances in prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood levels was awarded with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of advances (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) against human mind factor VIII, mouse, or Hamsterprotein, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted its approval to Baxter AG for use with advances in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitution therapy according to the severity of factor VIII-Mangels, after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">The factor VIII-activity in the corresponding period shall not fall under the specified plasma level (in% of the norm, or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injections all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute attacks are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injections all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the danger exists for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment there is to control the administered dose and frequency of injections a reasonable identification of the factor VIII plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different semvials.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis took care of bleeding prophylaxis in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses ranging between 20 and 40 I.E. from factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor of VIII plasma values are not reached, or if the blood pressure is not overwhelmed with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed in order to prove a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The reduction speed should be set according to the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a prominent complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always governed against the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII of immunoglobulins, which are quantifically diagnosed in Bethesda units (B.E.) pro ml plasma by modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposition compared to the factor VIII, whereby the risk depends on the biggest 20 exposure times in the biggest and genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">For untreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposition and anamethically well-known inhibitors, due to the changeover factor VIII-product on another, the reoccur of (lower-earlier) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Because of the rare appearance of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>

<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP has provided the basis of safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension of 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited appointed the Committee on Humanities (CHMP), officially withdrawn his application for the application of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni Cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has genetically modified that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In the virus in Advexin it is a "Adenovirus" which was so altered that there is no copies of itself and thus no infection can trigger.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocin would have been blown directly into the tumours and make the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>

<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumours brings benefits for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee had contracted concerns relating to the processing of drug in the body, the way of administration and the security of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proven that Advexin can be made in reliable manner, and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in touch with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The CHMP does not use the CHMP in consideration of whether the withdrawal of patients for patients has currently been participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered active ingredient, means that the tablets are so together so that one of the effective ingredients are immediately released, and the other slowly has been released over some hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergy rhinitis (hay fever disease) in patients with nose skin swelling (clogged nose) in patients with nose skin swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers over 12 years, the recommended dose of aerinaze twice daily is a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of nasal mucous membranes (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be refuted to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main force measurements were the changes of the severity of the ay fever symptoms that were reported in the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients enrolled their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated a standard scale as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the clayloads of the nose, the patient reported that Aerinaze's patients showed an increase in symptoms of 46.0%, compared to 36.0% in patients who were pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients undertake a decrease of symptoms of 37,4% compared to 26.7% in patients who are desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of aerinjuries (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachycardia (cardiovitis), asyngitis (loss of loss), asyngitis (loss of loss), somnia, insomnia, insomnia), anxiety and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may in patients who may be hypersensitive against desloratadine, pseudoephedrin or one of the other components, against adrenal substances or Loratadine (another drug for treatment of allergies), not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze doesn't have to be used in patients that suffer from a bottling glaucoma (hypertension), cardiovascular disease (hypertension), or even a haemorrhagic impact (caused by a cerebral stroke) or have a risk for a haemorrhagic impact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a approval for aeronaze's transport to aeronaze on the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is in the whole to swallow (i.e. without they be crushed or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze was to be applied due to the lack of data to impotence and effectiveness (see section 5.1) not in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time for 10 days, as for long time application the activity of pseudoephedrine may take off at the time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous skins in the upper respiratory system, the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze Pseudoephedrin contains the medicine also contra-indicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (Mao) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity combined with other vases of pseudoephedrine, permelid, haergolin, achydroergotamin, achydroergotamin, phenylephrine, phenylephrine, Ephedrine, Oxymetacolin, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data will not suffice to add appropriate recommendations to dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not examined in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data will not suffice to add appropriate recommendations to dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that the treatment in occurrence of hypertension or a speedos, heart rhythmic disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or reinforcement of headaches) must be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In treatment of treatment groups: patients with cardiac disease patients suffering from cardiac disease • patients with hyperrhythmosis • patients with a myocardial infarction in the medical history, diabetes mellitus, blisterity, or bronchospasm in the history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze has to deploy at least 48 hours before the performing dermatological tests, because antihistamine can prevent positive reactions for skin reactions or reduce in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">Within the context of clinical trials with Desloratadine, in which erythromycin or Ketoconazole have been administered, however, non-clinical interaction or changes in plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, there were no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and matched to placebo patients, regardless of whether Desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This unabolism of the metabolism of Desloratadine Responzym was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 are not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inspiracy of use of aerinjuries during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however no increase in frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since Reproductive studies on animals should not always be transferred to humans and due to the vasokonstritractor properties of pseudoephedrin should not be applied to aerinaze in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified in very rare cases that may lead to a impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (bombing, apnoe, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, heart circulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, counteracts) with possible letteries.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, anxiety, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal-insufficiency, cardiac disease, swelling, vomiting, presial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, sense of disturbances, hypertension, and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is especially likely to children, just like atropine-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupillenrigid and - dilemma, skin irritation, hyperthermia and Gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">This close to inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion rate P-Selektin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring ranges of air performance including the amplification of subjective implications or the tasks that are connected with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day, increased frequency of drowsiness were determined in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause any sympathomimetic effects as such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykardia or manifestations of a ZNS revival.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1.248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergy rhinitis where 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonist effectiveness of aerinaze tablets were determined based on the total score for symptoms of symptoms (except osmucosal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the weakening effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to sex, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after submission of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze of healthy volunteers on 14 days the flowrate of Desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic-multifaceted study, which was performed using formulation on healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects disloratadine were otherwise noted.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component-Interact study shows that the exposition (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin after the sole of pseudoephedrin bioequivalent was to exposition according to an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional trials for safety harmacology, for toxicity in repeated Gabe, for genotoxicity and reproduction of high-production data with Desloratadine, however, no special dangers to humans are recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects rose in the context with the synopsy pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-free technology, the combination of Loratadine / pseudoephedrine was in the oral gift of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was investigated in total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and juveniles with allergy rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergy rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of hives, impairment of sleep, and performance in day) before and after six-dimensional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body accumulate the syrup in the same way as the tablets and use of the tablets are harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">Allergic to allergic preoperative rhinitis, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius were examined for an average decrease of symptom symptoms (symptom number) by 25 to 32%, compared with the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria, the decrease of the symptom appearance with Aerius 58 and 67% compared with 40 and 33% compared to placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius should not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadin, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted a approval for Aerius on the transport network of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One capsule once daily, with one or without meal, for the alleviation of the symptoms of allergy rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergy rhinitis) and urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies at the application of Desloratadine in young people aged 12 to 17 years (see section 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergy rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should terminate equivalent to the previous clinical symptoms and can be resumed after the sound of the symptoms and during which reoccur will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">If persistent allergy rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), patients may be recommended during allergy time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinical-relevant interactions were not adopted in clinical trials with desloratadine pills not to be given to erythromycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacology study it was not increased in the equilibrium of aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified in very rare cases, which may lead to any impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">At clinical trials in various indications, including allergy rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urtikaria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius on patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than at Placebo (1,2%), mouth-drying (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">With a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect headaches, which were treated at 5,9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadine and were treated at 6.9% of the patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, up to 45 mg desloratadine (ninth clinical dose) were given, no clinical effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibition of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human body cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion firm P-Selektin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple outlets in the desloratadine, a dose of up to 20 mg was administered daily for 14 days, has no statistically significant or clinically relevant kardiovascular effect.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically-pharmacology study, in the Desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-time clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTC interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In an individual study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring ranges of air performance including the amplification of subjective implications or the tasks that are connected with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergy rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as rivae, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching flow and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic Rhinolatitis may be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms or an intermittent allergy rhinitis and persistent allergy rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergy rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergy rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As the total score of the quality of life in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergy rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urtiaria was to be examined for further forms of urtikaria, because the underlying Pathophysiology have given the underlying pathology in the different forms of different forms, and chronic patients can be simulated.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a suspected factor in all urtikarious diseases, that Desloratadin is also listed in other forms of urtikaria in other forms of urtikaria. this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urtikaria, Aerius was effective in improving the size and number of hives at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine drugs, the minority in patients who responded not to antihistamine treatment, eliminated from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvements to a population of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with deloratadine treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disorder of the sleeping and watchword, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate this variable.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a Pharmacokinetics study, which was comparable to patients with seasonal allergy rhinitis population, was achieved at 4% of patients a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no focal points for clinically relevant Kumulation after a daily application of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, this was not identified for Metabolism of Desloratadine of the enzyme yet so that interactions with other pharmaceuticals will not be excluded completely</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 are not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier study with Desloratadine in a dose of 7,5 mg, meals (greasy, low-calory breakfast) are not out of availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The experiments performed with Desloratadine and Loratadin showed a comparative degree of exposition of Desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative comparison regarding the toxicity of Desloratadine and of Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional trials for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated Gabe, genotoxicity and reproduction of reproduction are not able to recognize the pre-clinical data with desloratadine no special dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken regardless of the meals, in relieving symptoms of allergy rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergy rhinitis) and urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The driving doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of infection are caused by an infection (see below 4.4) and that no data are proposed to support the treatment of a infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory action or anatomical anomalies should play a role in the diagnosis, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory and skin tests.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic disloratadine is restricted and experienced a higher substance (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, the restricted metabolism is identical with children who metabolized normally metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains saccharose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of a fructose intolerant, glucose-absorbing or a saccharase-isomaltase- insufficiency of this medicine do not take.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinical-relevant interactions were not adopted in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, which erythromycin or ketoconazole are taken in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacology study at the same time of taking of aerius tablets and alcohol, the effective influence of alcohol was not increased (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">At clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergy rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urtikaria were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius on patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and young people who were given up to 45 mg desloratadine (ninth clinical dose), no clinical effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 years entered for an antihistamine therapy of 1,25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergy rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadine in adults and children, can increase the effectiveness of Desloratadine in adults on the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple injuries in adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine, used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, was not described statistically significant or clinically relevant kardiovascular effect.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacology study of adults and youngsters, in the desloratadine of 45 mg daily (the nine-time clinical dose) was employed over ten days in adults, no extension of the QTC interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of drowsiness were determined in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7,5 mg, Aerius tablets produced in clinical trials to no impairment of Psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacology studies in adults it was neither to an increase of alcohol induced performance nor to increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and young patients with allergy rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as rivae, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching flow and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As the total score of the quality of life in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius tablets have been effective, reduce the seasonal allergy rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urtikaria, Aerius was effective in improving the size and number of hives at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolic phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharynoretical parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-course study with sirative rhinitis in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic preabolic disease.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadine was about 6times higher and the Cmax approximately 3 to 4times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no focal points for one clinical-relevant active ingredient after a daily use of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various individual research studies, the AUC- and Cmax values of desloratadine in pediatric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Desloratadine syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, this did not identify the metabolism of Desloratadine of the enzyme yet so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect the flu (type) H5N1 virus (type) H5N1 virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a future pandemic to protect a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out if a new tribe of the influenza has grown slightly, because the people still lack an immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detected the vaccine contained in the vaccine as "physical foreign" and makes antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This way, the immune system is then able to form faster antibodies in contact with an influenza.</seg>
<seg id="1899">The membranes of the virus with "surface antigens" (protein in the reed surface, which recognize the human body as a body-alien), is cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspector of some of the study centers showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This reduces the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of vaccine to meet the requirements of the EMEA to Prepanic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot be swallowed as a solution, Agenerase is available as a solution for insertion, but this can not be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should then be prescribed when the doctor has checked the antiviral medicinal of the patient had previously used, and the ability to address the virus to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which can be taken with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral drug.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase Reduces in combination with other antiviral drugs the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids does not cure AIDS, but can prevent the damage of the immune system and thereby the development of AIDS connected infections and illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was examined in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not been treated with Protease.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The anti-condensed Ritonavir reinforced medicine Agenerase was compared with 206 adults who used formerly Protease Inhibitors of other Proteasants.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indignator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously occupied no Protease of patients had no viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than insdinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Adebit reduced the viral load, but one of the children who were treated earlier with protruding was only very few in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with protruding compounds, encountered with Ritonavir reinforced drugs as effective after 16-week treatment as effective as other Protease Inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other Protease of patients, it came under Agenerase with Ritonavir for a stronger decay of viral load after four weeks than in patients who continue their hibernation to date:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase cannot be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against amprenavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase cannot be applied in patients that are dehydrated (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicinal products that are dismantled and in high concentrations in the blood of health, are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1921">How in other medicines to HIV exists in patients who are Agenerase, the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of bone tissue), a osteonekrosis (symptoms of bone tissue) or an immune activating syndroms (symptoms of infection caused by the recovered immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">At the end, the Committee on Humanmedicinal Products (CHMP) found the benefits of Agenerase during application in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years over against risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetist amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee set out that the benefits of Adebit in combination with Ritonavir are taken in combination with Ritonavir for patients who had previously not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally licensed under "extraordinary circumstances, as at the time of approval for scientific reasons, limited information were submitted.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Commission of Glaxo Group to permit approval for the use of Agenerase throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infected persons, Protease Inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be given to the pharmaceutical inetcommy of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see section 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance patterns and the prior-line treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to inclusion is 14% less than by Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If authoase capsules without the intention of Ritonavir (Boostery), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other Protease were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data to discomfort and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose to Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use of liver with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with caution is to be contraindicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase will not be able to possess a small therapeutic width as well as the substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to the contractual effect of Amprenavir during the intake of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be pointed out that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy are not leading to healing of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infection or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase prevented not the risk of a transmission of HIV on others by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk for heavy liver problems with potentially deadly evolution.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of Hepatitis B or C please read the specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with above-existing liver function including chronic and chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under a antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir are confused with Fluticast or other Glucokortikoids, which is not recommended that the potential use of the risk of dynamic corporate-eroes effects including morbus Cushing and regression of the side-renal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As a substrate of the HMG-CoA-reductase-Hemmer-Coa-reductase-inhibitors are strongly dependent on CYP3A4 because of the increased risk of fiopathy, including Rhudomyolysen, is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyccycate, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International normalised), methods are possible to determine the substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who are taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma level by Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptiva can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadon is given at the same time with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be performed based on Opiatric symptoms, in particular if there are even low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity of a toxicity in the Agenerative solution, this latter form is contra-indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution regarding certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to duration 5 if a rash occurs in systemic or allergic reaction (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including proteasant therapy, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing Diabetes Mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to whose therapy medication were required to associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>

<seg id="1956">In hemophile patients (type A and B), which were treated with protruding compounds, reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cuttled haematoms and hemmarthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">The HIV-infected patients with heavy immunodefect can become an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) at the time of antiretroviral or residual opportunistic infection, which leads to serious clinical condition or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifuntorial tortiology is assumed (including use of cortiosteroides, alcohol use heavy immunosuppression), cases of osteecrosis especially reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combinations (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrate with small therapeutic width of Agenerase shall not be able to possess a low therapeutic width as well as substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6-Substrate with small therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir should not be combined with drugs, which are mainly associated with drugs, and for increased plasma level with severe and / or life-threatening effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease of the AUC by Amprenavir which can cause a virological failure and lead to a resistance trend.</seg>
<seg id="1962">When empting, plasma glucose levels in combination with a dose increase of other Protease Inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir were observed very frequently unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>

<seg id="1965">A dose adaption for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nelgloavir are given together with Amprenavir (see also Equestionnaire below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for by contrast, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is given in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of Amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily which cover the efficacy and warmth of this treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% bought if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) is given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were obtained in the combination of Amprenavir (400 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), there are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) met in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing rate for the simultaneous failure of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is not recommended because the effectiveness and inspiracy of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinthetic study on the application of Agenerase in combination with Didanosin, but is recommended that the proceeds of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart. (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amicirenz in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosages is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Easpirenz in combination with Amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposition of both proteasants would be serious.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other Protease Inhibitors and existing data suggest that Nevirapin may possibly tumble the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs are used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin is less effective because of the decreased or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is provided; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed as a precise prediction of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Simultaneous alleviation of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to a rise in the plasma concentration of Rifabutin, around 193%, and thus an increase in severe side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If any clinical reasons is necessary to obtain Rifabutin along with Adease, to reduce the dosage of Rifabutin, at least half the recommended dose, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma level of both pharmaceuticals could be increased.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of 700 mg of mould renavir and 100 mg of mould conazole daily in plasma increased by 25% and the AUC (0-2) to 2.69 times a day, which is observed after 200 mg of Ketoconazole daily, which was observed after 200 mg of Ketoconazole daily without a concurrent application of famprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 if they are applied together with Agenerase, may possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs, if they are applied in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other Protease Inhibitors, it is advisable that Antazida is not taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvex-vulva, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, carbamazepine, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir may lead to a reduction of the plasma level of Amprenavir.</seg>

<seg id="1986">The simultaneous dosage with ADE5 inhibitors can increase and increase the effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, longsuffering and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily, with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) were significantly increased, while the endogeneous inflicism rose by about 86% (90% conversion intervall 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the same gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended that this Glucokortikoids are not recommended, unless the possible benefit of a treatment that weighs the risk of dynamic cortical eroes (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovryatin and Simvastatin, their hydrogen rotates strongly dependent on CYP3A4 are expected to expire the plasma level of the plasma level during equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma level increases this hMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor in myopathy, including Rhydomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations till the stabilization of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase cannot be used together with oral mid-mid Midazolam (see section 4.3), while at the same time using Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneously usage of parenteral Midazolam with other Protease inhibitors point out a possible increase of the plasma level of midazolam um 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadon is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be administered on Opiatric symptoms, in particular if there are even low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per small loading of historic comparisons, no recommendation can be given, as the Amprenavir dose is given, if Amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the same time of goods of warfarin or other oral anticoagulations together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International normalised) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or reinforcement of antithrombotic effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protests and thus prevents the process of viral gag- and gag-pol- Polyprotein levels with the result of a formation of unriptive, non-infectious virus particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both acute and chronic infected lymphoblastic cellars (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the area of 0,012 to 0,08 µM of acutely infested cells and is 0,41 µM of chronic infected cells.</seg>

<seg id="2025">Analysis of genotypic interpretations based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with Protease Pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations L10F / I, L33F, M36V, I62A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M, with Ritonavir and a lowered probability of a virology response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation pattern can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to draw the current interpretation systems to analyze resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypical resistance based on phenotypical value analysis systems can be used in combination with genotypic data for estimating the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with Protease Pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic Cut-offs (partitions) for FPV / RTV which can be used for interpreting results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Amprenavir associated pattern generates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelgloavir and Saquinavir are generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other Proteasants for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on five-five antiretroviral not previously treated patients with whom a famprenavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 Isolate), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir (three of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir reserves his activity against some other Protease isolates; the receipt of this activity appears from the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the tightening of a variety of mutations in borders, which may affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open trial (600 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidanalog (NRTI) or a standard care (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominated with low-controlled Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">An hundred and threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus-sensitivity compared to Agenerase, at least one of the other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">Primary analysis carried out the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the period adjusted average value of APV / Ritonavir in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the plasma last 16 weeks, with a non-subsable threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The receipt of efficacy of unbiased areas is based on two uncontrolled trials with 288 HIV infinfected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was examined daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously given at least one (78%) or two (42%) together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / mL at a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered under the treatment optimisation of the expected benefit of "irreporous" Agenerase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is approximately 1-2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for by contrast, by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The submission of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration in the steady State (Cmin, ss) was influenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of Resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The seemulation volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be mounted to a large volume of volume as well as an unhinted penetration of Amprenavir from the blood stream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the substance in the plasma, where the amount of unwalled amprenavir which is the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unwalled Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients in the Steady State concentration in the Steady State at the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore the medicinal products must be induced or inhibit the CYP3A4 if they are administered with caution, if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The addition of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposition as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is obtained from the solution 14% less biavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrams-base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal impairment to the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir should be minor.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schemes lead to Amprenavir-plasma glucose levels comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice a day without simultaneous release of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies with Amprenavir in mice and rats served on male animals named hepatocellular Adenome with doses of the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8--fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily allowance of 1200 mg of Amprenavir.</seg>

<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be controlled and proved in clinical everyday life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients neither during the treatment of Agenerase nor by the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in young animals, who were treated with 4 days at the age of 4, showed a high mortality in both the control and with the Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma spot that was significantly higher (rats) or not significantly higher (rats), however, a number of minor changes including thymus elongation and slightly increased skeleton changes were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If authoase capsules, without the amplifiers of Ritonavir (Boostery), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be effected in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunction she is indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyccycate, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International normalised), methods are possible to determine the substance concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used to treat patients with assiysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase lack) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with the brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (Glykosaminoglykane, Thursdays) are not dismantled and thus accumulated in most bodies in the body and to be ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following not neurological symptoms of MPS I may occur: enlarged liver, rigid joints, reduces the movements, diminished lungs, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital, or hospital with rinsulating equipment, and patients need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the medicine was examined, however, its effectiveness was measured by its effect in relation to reducing the GAG concentration camps in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme increased the GAG-concentrations in the urine around 60%, and half of the treated children dismissed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients with over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, abdominal pain, rendalgia (joint pain), pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat assion, fever and reactions at the Infusion Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of the lung function), tachykardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and scrap frost.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied in patients who may react strongly (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be able to check all new information that may be announced and updated this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients to observe the Aldurazyme reactions in relation to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the Genzyme Europe B.V., its approval for the transport of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a combined form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by means of a combined DNA technology using CHO acid culture supernatants (Chinese hamster ovary, ovierstock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term encaporation therapy in patients with assiysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase lack) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient can be increased, every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for this patient.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for this patient.</seg>
<seg id="2291">For patients treated with Aldurazyme patients, infusion-related reactions can be defined as any in relation to infusion or until the end of the infusion process (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting, in the reloading equipment for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">As a result of the clinical Phase 3 trial, almost all patients of IgG antibodies against Laronidase patients are usually within 3 months starting from treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction, must be treated with caution in use of aldurazyme (see section 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience in terms of recovery after a longer break, it must be careful because of the theoretically increased risk campaign after an interruption of treatment carefully.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyretica) to minimize potential risk of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or middle infection caused the treatment with antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction in the infusion rate when the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, serious infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be proved.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be entered with a reduction of the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, which occurred the preceding response.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or Procain because a potential risk of interference with intracellular intake of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not occur on direct or indirect beneficial effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">There are no data in newborns that were expelled to Laronidase over the breast milk, it is recommended to breastfeeding the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects of clinical trials were instituted mainly as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug reactions associated with Aldurazyme, who were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension for a total of 45 patients at the age of 5, are often observed in the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional participation of upper respiratory and lungs, severe reactions, including bronchospasm, breaths and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug pervents related to Aldurazyme, who were reported in the table under 5 years of age, with greater damaging form and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, it came to a serokonversion within 3 months after the treatment of a serokonversion, usually within one month to a serokonversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (resp. until an early withdrawal from the study) were found in 13 / 45 patients with radioimmunoincipitation (RIP) assay before, among them 3 patients with which it never had to be serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust decrease in the Harn, while in patients with high antibody titers to establish a variable reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal until low-neutral inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed not to impair the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, typically with the formation of unwanted drug reactions, typically fell along with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The basis for the enzyal therapy is in one for the hydrolyse of the accumulated substrate and the preventing of another accumulation of adequate restoration of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly absorbed into the circulation and the lesions, the most likely via Mannosis-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients in the mean phenotype and only a patient dismissed the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an forcated explicitatory volume (FEU) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 feet.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of expected FEU and absolute obediline in the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study where they received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients against the placebo and the obeability that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In an open renewal study, an improvement and / or maintenance of this effects of up to 208 weeks occurs in Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is non-significant over this period and the absolute lung-volume increased proportional to body-growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">One of the 26 patients with a hepatoma of treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG levels was found at Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinine) who remained constant for the course of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In regard to heterogeneous disease manifestation of patients who merged in 6-minute test (for the expected percentage of normal subjects), was generally one improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and mean worse in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A year-old Open Phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied in 20 patients at the time of their admission to the study below 5 years (16 patients with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in the Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size increase (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) found out according to the Z score for this age group and all 4 patients with the mean routing form proven only limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study investigations were carried out to pharmaceutical impact of different aldurazyme dosing schemata at the GAG-Mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be with patients who have difficulties with weekly information, but is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information, which will rate annually, and if necessary, the summary of the rug features will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmaceutical profile in patients under 5 years old was similar to the patients with older and less affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of pellet reboxed in its active form is lighter in cancer cells. in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of pharmaceutical and longer treatment in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was investigated for the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelioms in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-single lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study on 571 patients were treated with local advanced or metastatic disease, which had previously been compared with chemotherapy for docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer) and both in combination with cisplatin was found in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously established no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2387">In clinical trials were required in patients with a creatinine Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min there are no dosages, which are recommended in case of all patients recommended Dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data sheet in patients with a creatine clearance between 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However patients with a liver functional restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper level of the upper limit value (in the absence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times of the upper limit (for presence of liver metastases) are not especially studied in studies.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose of dose for more cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute Neutrophilane count and maximum non-haematological toxicity, as they were observed in the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 havatological and non-holatological toxicity as Neutropenie and infection with grade 3 / 4 Neutropenie was considered to be considered a prior treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed patients have to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophyl- laktic measures to reduce the severance related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinine Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous use of non-steroid antimonoxide (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetremixed therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients required for therapy with pemetrexed is required to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days prior to therapy, at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetremixed therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who performed these events, have appropriate risk factors for occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid level collection in trancellular space, a drainage of the Ergonomous flux of the Pemetreboxed treatment are expected.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including Myocardial infarction, and rovrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed when the active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenued lifelines (except yellow fever, this vaccine is indexed) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinine Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid is to be avoided in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy, at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetraxed to therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data for interaction potentials with NSAIDs have long half-life as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre-.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between orinal anticoagulants and antineoplasty chemotherapy requires increased surveillance rate of INR (International normalised) if the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anticoagulants.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by additional gift of a Corticosteroids (an pharmaceuticals that can be used as antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">Application in patients under 18 is not recommended because the effects in this age group will not lie enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), which prevents the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was investigated in three main studies of 1 842 adults, the chemotherapies received strong or excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">The strong trigger for nauseas, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi showed up to 57% of the patients with Ondansetron treated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi showed up to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission appointed Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the office of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe nautical-borne chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and vomiting in moderately emetogenous chemotherapy due to cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi is used for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong pologenic chemotherapy by adding another Corticosteroids chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron the colon massage can prolong, patients with anamnestian oripation should be monitored or monitored by a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Like with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is provided at the same time of palonosetron with drugs, which extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval extends to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Aside in connection with other chemotherapeutics Gabe, Aloxi shall not be used in the days after chemotherapy nor for prevention of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies inhibits palletosetron inhibit against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycloabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, there was no significant pharmaceutical interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of palonosetron and a steady metoclopramids, an CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population based pharmaceutical inetan analysis (Dexamethaso and Rifampicin) and of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Amiodaron, Cimetidin, Paroxetine, Chinidin, Ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of palletosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied to pregnant women, unless it is necessary to eliminate the doctor's treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms to observe adverse events (altogether 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and orcharity (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity and reactions in the application (burning, contraction, complaints, and pain) were given in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage showed a similar potential of unwanted events such as in other dispensing groups; no dose of action relationships were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, due to the major distribution volume, dialysis, however, is probably no effective therapy at a Aloxi- crossing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blindings, a total of 1.132 patients who received a generally emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg. of Ondansetron (half-life 7,3 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) was received intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double blindstudy, 667 patients who received a strong emogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2ccyamide and dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron were compared with patients that were 32 mg Ondansetron that were intravenously given in day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of clinical trials with moderate-ogeneous chemotherapy and the study are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron are calculated on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the isolation of the ventricular de- and polarization in polarization and extend the duration of the action process.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers conducted the evaluation of the EKG-effects of i.v. administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0,25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the Concentration Time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally used in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ - / kg in terms of healthy and cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous gift of palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses was measured with 11 Hodencarcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured from the Palonosetron plasma concentration of 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">In terms of intravenous intravenous mills of 0.25 mg palonosetron in 3 consecutive days, total exposition (AUC0- ∞) were compared with once intravenous intravenous objectivity of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was measured after the one-off period of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and some 50% are converted into two primary metabolites compared to the Palonosetron by less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolization have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower dimensions, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination elimination of intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron have been found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged active ingredient made around 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolus injection, the total physiology was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver functional impairment the terminale elimination period and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but the reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects have been observed more than sufficient about the maximum human therapeutic execution, which indicates a slight relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10. pre-clinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionic channels, which can be involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the action capacity.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose was given in about the 30mn of therapeutic exposure of human beings), which have been given every two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, pituitary, pancreas, incarrenal disease) and skin tumor, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but because of the used high doses and da Aloxi is used for a unique application, the relevance of these results will be low as for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The holder of the authorization must inform the European Commission on the plans for goods on the market concerning this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) adopted a negative certificate referred to by the approval of the pharmaceutical company Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is similar to an organic medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal incision, which is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Heimant").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long lasting) hepatitis C (a disease by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic research, the liver tissue causes damage to, in addition, the values of the liver enzymes alanine - aminotransfer (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was filed for the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon appeals data to the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (action structure, composition and purity of the drug, action, safety and effectiveness of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with Hepatitis C the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study was measured how many patients followed in 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns they have been exposed, the data for the stability of the active substance and the drug are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C constitutes regarding the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease is retardant with more patients than in the reference to the referral care; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test was used to examine the question in which the drug forms an immune reaction (i.e. the body of body - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (one with cruel infection) and small infected infirmations (Riss- or Schnittwunden), deviations and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections, detectionately or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alargo against this kind of infections may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin area should not exceed 2% of body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not cancelled within two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient and examine alternative treatments in weakening.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosome (the pieces of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indignator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was discontinued after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients suffer from Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected maltars, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar contact: if the results were taken together with skin wound, about 90% of the patients met both groups upon treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was found in the treatment of Abszessen (eager-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that were provoked, or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an estimate at the office.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Humarzneimittel (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo were weigh to the risks of the following surface treatment: • Impetigo, the infected small inconations, depreciation or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the merger of Glaxo Group Ltd. its approval for the use of Altargo into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients in which two to three days are no better than that, once again, and an alternative therapy are considered to be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensing or heavy local irritation by the application of Retapamulin salbe the treatment is broken, which salts are carefully managed and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection are started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections of which MRSA is known as an Erreger (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies, the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections that were caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if a 2- or 3-day treatment is no improvement or failure of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topian drug is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Because of the low plasma cutting, which have been achieved by human use on the needy eyes or infested surfaces, a clinical-relevant inhibition in vivo has not been expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the same period of 2 times a day 200 mg of Ketoconazole increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% retapamulin salbe increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low-systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosages will not be considered to apply if topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with the CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction after oral ingestion and are insufficient in relation to the birth and the fötale / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topial antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to prevent systemic antibiotic.</seg>

<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side effect on the distribution site, which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">An active effect of retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism by Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction of the 50S underunit of the bacterial Ribosome, which differs from the bindings of other ribosomal interact antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the ribosomales protein are involved in the region of ribosomal protein, and in the region of ribosomal P-ties and the Peptidyltransferase.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this connection of the Puromutiline within the peptidyling, partial P-ties interactions and prevent normal education of active 50S ribosomal sub-units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If applicable to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retapamulin is supposed to appear in at least some infections should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to the treatment of S.aurreus the presence of tribes should be considered as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases caused by the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two doses of existing vaccine, whereby an protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used when immunization is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the two doses can be led to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a starting dose for hepatitis A or B can be desired, Ambirix or other hepatitis A- or -B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines are involved in bringing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can cause a sickness.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens to be "strange" and antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix adult and since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix kids.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix are administered within three doses of existing vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults, also supports as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indignator for efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children that had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of vaccine was compared with a six-month intervals between two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of anti-antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix at a six-month distance between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite deficiency, pain, redness, redness, tiredness (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may react to patients who may have been sensitive to the active ingredients, one of other components or other omycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. for authorization of equipment of Ambirix on the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard arm for grasping with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the appointment of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection vaccination is desired for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination of combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Anti-hepatitis B surface coatings on anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet secured whether immunohsient persons addressed to a hepatitis A- vaccine as protection does not require a collection of investigational antibodies because it may also be protected by immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injectors should be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the substance of the vaccine it will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standard floral pattern is recommended with combining hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface finishing.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of detatalysis patients and people with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibody is achieved so that in these cases the gift of another vaccine may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intramuscous injection or intramuscular administration in the Gesascular muscle could lead to a subtle implication, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In these cases, Ambirix cannot be injected to hemorbozytopenia or hemagile dysfunction as it can occur in these cases following intramuscular gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix in the second life year in the form of separate injection, Tetanus- and Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masking-mine-vaccine was given to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunossiressive therapy or in patients with immunodefect must be assumed that maybe no adequate immune response will be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults, was the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, Matrieritis, headache and fever comparable with the frequency, which was observed in former thesiomerically and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccine doses have been administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 up to 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared to the 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and complexity on a calculation basis per vaccination room Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects who were compared to 39,1% for the subjects of a dose of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">Following the entire vaccine cycle, 66,4% of the subjects who had arrived in Ambirix were vaccinated for pain, compared with the 3-dose combinations had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the overall frequency of Mateness was comparable to a proband in height (i.e. above all vaccination cycle at 39,6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects that received the 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and sincerity was small and comparable to the combination of combination with the 3-doses vaccination was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In comparative study of 1 to 11-year vaccinations, the occurrence of local reaction and general actions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable with the 3-dose combinations using 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2759">But for the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not reported per progam.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines, which have severe side effects during 2-doses of vaccines with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombined hepatitis B surface antigen, was statistically unable.</seg>
<seg id="2761">Clinical trials that were conducted in clinical studies at the age of 1 to 15 years, were the serokonversionate for anti-HAV 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 of the dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The rates of service for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, taken in the month 6 (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was conducted in 12- as well as 15-year-old, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the basic combined fuel with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">At the 289 people whose immunogenity was recyclable, the Seroprotutionsrates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 according to match of the 3-dose classification.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which was achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, vaccines were either a 2-cans vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of combined hepatitis B surface treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2767">At persons who were between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibodies could be traced over a minimum of 24 months following the immunization with Ambirix in 0-6 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction in this study was comparable to both antigens to be combined with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface treatment in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study by 12- and including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibodies were similar to immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered with a combined diphtheric, tetanus- and 8 haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine battery (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined masks-mumps, was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults, showed a similar seroprotum and serialization rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccine, the doctor will give you / your child from a vaccination with ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of an effective hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a combined hepatitis B surface antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered for a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination before termination of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is suffering from serious bleeding dysfunction, under the skin and not in your muscles, if you are pregnant or interrupted the disease in your own body or a treatment in your own body.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be needed to see how strongly the reaction to vaccine is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Do you take your doctor if you / your child may take another medicine / take (including those that you may have been vaccinated without disclosure) or if you have been vaccinated or impregnated bulins (antibodies) have been given or this in the near future is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response is not enough and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine should be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be connected to separate places and as possible as possible limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immunglobulins, it is probably that the reaction to the vaccine is still enough.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix pregnant or lactating women is not administered, but it is strongly necessary that they are vaccinated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) before you / your child.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have become known since the first approval of the entry, the CHMP has left the view that the benefits risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was posted only in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited to the small public exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete Enzymdefect or with hyperammonic Encephalopathy (brain compensation) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is divided - divided into several single doses, mixed by means of food, or having a gastrored chives (through the abdominal wall in the stomach-leading hose) or a nosonde (through the nose in the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was no comparative study because ammonaps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (an essential medicine, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fossaps can also cause loss of loss of loss of loss in blood, depression, stimulness, earache, loss, loss, flavouring, nausea, excessive, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Humanmedicinal Products (CHMP) came to the conclusion that ammonaps prevented in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle to high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary circumstances, because on the order of the condition at the time of approval, limited information can be submitted to this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The deployment is indicated in all patients with which a complete Enzymstick is already manifested in the newborn (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzymes manifested), an indication of the application where in the history is a hyiphate pozephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are not able to swallow tablets to swallow or for patients with gorges of AMMONG is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually by taking the protein tolerance and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthesase or Ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Arginine uccinate deficiency have to get arginine in a doses of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMOOPS tablets may not be given to patients with gorges, as a risk for the emergence of estophagusulzera, if the tablets are not given immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AM3DPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and oil recovery only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolization and excretion of phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney disease.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous bill of phenylacetate to young rats at a very high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) there was a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There were also a reluctant maturing of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be detected if phenylacetate is separated by humans into the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMOOPS during breastfeeding is indexed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical studies with AM3DPS, at 56% of patients at least an unwanted event (AE) came out with at least 78% of this unwanted events that it was not related to AM3DPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anoretical patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy associated with lymphoidosis, pancytopeny, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdosing took an average dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">This symptoms occur with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed an dossilimit of neurotoxicity in one intravenous lamination of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolish active connection which is conjugated by acetylene acetylacetylGlutamine, which is separated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Comparchiometric is seen by phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea-cycle can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyanyrate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is early enough and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of early manifest form of disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborrowed was almost always infusion, and the disease carried out even in treating with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemophalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyate), proteinate grate and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn during postpartal (but within the first life of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and was treated prior to the first appearance of a hyperammonic Encephalopathy, but even in these patients, it was with time for many intellectual disabilities or other neurological defects.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotic form of Ornithintranscarium-manrock), which were treated from a hyperammonic Enzephalopathy and then permanently has been treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a proteined diet. the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible for treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological state can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrate oxidized to Phenylacetate oxidized, which is conjugated in the liver and kidney enzymatic by phenylacetylGlutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Concentrations of phenylbutyrat and his metabolites in plasma and urine were treated according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in patients with disorders of the urea-cycle, and replicted gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and his metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous gifts of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measuring plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyccycous dysfunction or hemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable by phenylacetate in the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate intercones were five times higher than the first gifts.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example at instable angina (a form of pain in the chest is with varying strength) or myocardial infarction (a form of pain in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">In angiox, angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients, which is administered to a higher dose and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to the heart in patients with angina or cardiac disease to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Almost 14 000 patients took part in the main study of the treatment of ACS grade, with the effect of Angiox in sole gift or in connection with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIA-inhibitor (GPI) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patients often became a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery, to prevent a lock) and they received additionally other medicines for prevention of blood clots, such as decoximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without an issue of GPI - during preventing new events (deaths, cardiac cases or precincarisation) after 30 days or a year totally effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who subjected to one PCI was angiox over to all indicators just as effective in severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against bivalry, other shepherds or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be applied in patients who had recently had a bleeding, and in people with strong blood pressure or serious incidents or cardiac infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Humarzneimittel (CHMP) reached the conclusion that angiox during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI an acceptable replacement for Heparin is.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the approval of the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd with approval for the use of angiox throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (instabile angina / non - ST-Hebbelfarkt (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency stop or if an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is carried out in another row a PCI, an additional pin of 0.5 mg / kg should be given to the infusion for the duration of the pressure to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion rate at 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours can be included.</seg>

<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with one PCI consists of a 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intravenous infusion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus gift of Angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT is shortened to 5 minutes) to less than 225 seconds, a second pin of bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully administered before the application and quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg Infusionsdosis is given right.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which can be subjected to one PCI (whether with balkonirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second pin dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered to test the fact that ACT 5 minutes later.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulans (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if using PCI-patients undertake number of bleedings on arterial punctuations, in patients who undergo a perkutanen Coronarintervention (PCI), during the treatment, may occur everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are indestructed and treated with bivalirudin, should ensure a monitoring of the INR value (International standard debt ratio) to ensure that the value is reached after replacing the treatment with bivalirudin again before the treatment of existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the active mechanism of anticoagulants (parparin, warfarin, thrombolytica or thrombozytentiers) can be assumed that these drugs will increase blood vessels.</seg>

<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected the thighs or the upper arm or as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease, in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin for regulation of glucose level (sugar) or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulinglulisin differs very slightly from Humaninsulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter factor has as a short-effective humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was applied in the application in combination with a durable inulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, if the insulin had not been working inoperative, Apidra was investigated in a study of 878 adults.</seg>

<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive against insulin lulisin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must possibly be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Sanofi Aventis Deutschland GmbH a approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall or contamination or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the areas of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the reduced glucose load capacity and reduced inulin delivery, the insulin need to be reduced in patients with restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any changes of the effects, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin-typs (normal, NPH, zincdeletes, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can draw a change in the insulin level.</seg>
