a rec@@ t@@ angle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is possible to apply if sufficient space is to be present ( where@@ by means of restri@@ ctions on the sign of the stair@@ case ) , then you can determine the relative position of the label in the rec@@ t@@ angle .
in the creation algorith@@ ms for tre@@ em@@ aps it should be maintained , that the area should not always be maintained . at the tre@@ ach@@ in &amp; fs@@ view ; this target is not always maintained . NOTE that less space is lost for the frame , if the rec@@ t@@ angle is square .
as the division of an entry for the infer@@ ior entries , the implementation will be delivered , and for avo@@ iding place losses due to frame always benef@@ icial the surfaces that are as possible as possible . the best methods are related to these are rows , columns or rec@@ ur@@ sive second parts .
you can specify the minimum surface area for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , a sound sample to the area of the parent place is shown , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an or@@ derly entry .

a simple to use camera interface is provided to you with your digital camera and you can download them directly to &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; work together .
modern digital cameras can be registered with the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ link ) for data transfer . the camera will also be used as a record drive . the camera will also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( PT@@ P ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras can use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , separate software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Im@@ aging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras for computers and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the necess@@ ity of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos the serial port are slowly out@@ dated . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports this cameras and guides the transfer of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so the examples might be read by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be pattern to be very slow or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint modular structure for &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Show@@ im@@ g and G@@ wen@@ view . goal is to provide the modules for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manip@@ ulate pictures in almost any way as it is also a user . your advantage is that it is much sim@@ pler , &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; by writing a small module to comp@@ lement a function when changes in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; own .
to simp@@ lif@@ y the windows , you can either change the page aff@@ ord with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode using F@@ 11 or Ctrl + Shift + F .
the move and laying of images is everywhere : you can delete a picture in another part of the property or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not available in key@@ word , dates or search .
- a file sel@@ ector allows you to remove the more common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for those fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ position . so the fil@@ tering is displayed in the symbol view . what fields can be displayed in the dialog of Al@@ ben@@ Settings .

what is a digital stock management - from the fashion word ? digital stock management is considered each part of the process of the process , sc@@ anned or digital photos does not store a form of digital stock management . however , most of us do not make this system@@ atic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures , take advantage and photos again . we will focus on the procedure for digital@@ ization , ass@@ uring , ass@@ uring , minim@@ ize , minim@@ ize , waiting , waiting , and export image files .
&amp; quot ; digital inventory equals , categ@@ or@@ ized , categ@@ or@@ ized , sec@@ ures , trans@@ forms , ready , and exported content that have a mon@@ et@@ ric or cultural value hab@@ en@@ .@@ quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data relating to data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that can be managed by a application or environment .
I dare to claim more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will definitely need not to store a certain photo as well as in the image files to store you with other programs , platforms and formats free .
the first thing you can do and know what you need to install any of your system . you must decide if you want to back up to your system if you want to save it on a reser@@ voir &amp; etc ; be@@ ware that you must change back to a bigger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found in one year several times at the same place . when you can take enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export a folder for pictures you to print or publish on a web page .
professional photographer made other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing pictures , archiv@@ ing , work processes , constant supply from images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not have to set up your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes mach@@ ining easier . separate new files from old files .
the split of original and un@@ employed files is simplified for a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an abstract picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to store met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; if you forget that EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data can be written in the file , then you can easily select the met@@ ad@@ ata in the database by clicking the corresponding point in the menu .
well , you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change the met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are the most important ones .
now , real work begins , since you should select any photo of words , labels and an evaluation . of course , you can select all images that can make the same at@@ tribute . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s talk with j@@ acks , key words , as you continue using other programs often hot , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import the cat@@ alog@@ ical images from another source with embedded j@@ ugs , then &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; automatically add the tree to the right place and can easily re@@ build the images in the tree or simply by moving a tree to another . the modified j@@ acks are followed by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; updated as the under@@ water being updated .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata are covered . this is a very coar@@ se representation , as each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . file name and calendar data is the properties of all images .
enough of the key@@ word - the next section refers to lab@@ elling or comments on the third important tool to kat@@ ze your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they don &apos;t want to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to arrive with your pictures .
look at this panorama . out of the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer look at some details , then you &apos;ll start to see people , the square .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Norm@@ andy 60 years after landing , memories , the historic period is again present , you may even listen to the silence . the label has been completely modified your per@@ c@@ eption this panorama .
for others , consider the title is possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you are showing pictures you should tell you a story . if you are taking pictures , you should help you understand about the motive that you can understand what you understand .
it &apos;s ok when a picture is not perfect if it &apos;s the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for themselves alone .
with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you can export a lot of text in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , when you export your pictures in web galleries . so you will find it into the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the web gallery . you need to tell the story here for a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before goo@@ gle@@ earth ? well , because with images the train of the spati@@ al presentation is already running with light speed .
the possibilities of the Geol@@ ocation are already inn@@ umer@@ able , and will surely be de@@ eper in the future , you can also export your jour@@ neys through images with geograph@@ ical data . you can also export to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google &apos;s Google Earth viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word match with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of copyright to remove the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for working others .
the following description tells you what information is stored in the introduc@@ tory page of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; as information , should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for ver@@ ters and author ) : this field should be used for your name , or the name of the photographer , e.g. when it is not desired , the name of a company or organisation is not used . after that value , it should not be changed . this field does not support com@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
Auto@@ ort@@ itel ( Syn@@ onym for author Line ) : links with the author . examples of this field may be the job title of the photographer . examples of the photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer . since this is a mer@@ chant for car field , must be also completed .
publisher ( Syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider &apos;s field to identify who doesn &apos;t have to use the author . if the photo is for a mess@@ aging agency as Reuters or Associated Press , this image can be found here , then the image will be shown here , the group / agency has been shown here .
it is very important to fill the author and Copyright Sec@@ tions , although this is not a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ating or change the solution for this problem . for private persons this is for the majority of your photos only by ger@@ in@@ expensive interest . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital watermark is unique for each image . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; in the near future a special module for st@@ acking processing is provided .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that lost on the road or a brand . this type of losses are the same that can happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , these are problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data stream company , has some interesting statistics for lack of data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be careful and you cannot tell you more than a few years . of course you can claim CDs and DVDs in archives . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 pieces which have a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . if you have the believe in your space player .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you are good Dis@@ ks and good recording equipment , they are not much more expensive than the cheapest one , but you write a lot more reliable . thus it turns out to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very vul@@ ner@@ able for mist@@ akes , even if you have just been written . therefore , they are only effective data , the rema@@ inder we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control problems . despite this massive protection they needed to dry algae , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs there is a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data of damaged disk , hard drives , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks released the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six@@ ty the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all of which to CDs and DVDs was also applicable also for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
if you are slow to check the data with a good recorder on high quality media in a non propri@@ etary format . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can start the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
Disk@@ Maker adop@@ ts your statistics . your manufacturer &apos;s warranty include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study about the error mechan@@ isms of hard drives : dis@@ mis@@ erst@@ u@@ das
shortly : dis@@ ks keep up at the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . if you are operating in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C , the most common error messages are due to the immediate emergency . these are especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and ex@@ port@@ ing . the expected lifetime achievement is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss because of over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss because of a current account before you have secured the files , but these losses are usually made back without big problems .
while most electrical devices does not make a lot of power , that can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . thus , these an@@ om@@ al@@ ies can cause severe damage , destroy mot@@ her@@ boards and other defects . thus protect yourself in front of the avo@@ ids loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity tips is an over@@ load protection . this is a device that is absorbed and the rest . it is normally in the form of a connector strip . but don &apos;t think any plug @-@ in power may also contain an over@@ load protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ load protection , then take care of the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care which provides protection against flash@@ backs and thus protects the connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can be used on your computer , you should make sure that all peri@@ pher@@ al devices that can be connected to your system . some manufacturers make over@@ voltage causes and also provide an over@@ voltage to your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a large number of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection is using your system in front of the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure in seconds can lead to loss of essential data . it can therefore be mean@@ ing@@ ful to invest in continuous power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can be able to store and run down the system . some models allow them to save up to the current . if you have a UPS according to it , you should be sure to get the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of battery and the provided software is interesting .
remember the potential risk that is exposed to your computer system and compare it to avoid paying attention to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ load protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you get used to avoid any cables . at the end , you should always remember to cancel all cables before you go into your holidays .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service . with the right configuration you can connect this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save the backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer to store data .
compared to the hard drives , they are very expensive - 40 Gb cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but there is no general backup solution . it is too slow for it .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com place online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB . the professional variant offers you more available , in case of Flick@@ r dram@@ atically more . for $ 25 per year you will receive unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and in the offer is a backup and a distribution box . so they are des@@ ir@@ able .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are vul@@ ner@@ able for transmitt@@ ing errors . the files@@ ystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integr@@ ity between operating systems and hard disk .
the worst thing is that you don &apos;t say if a transmission error occurred . all these dis@@ orders remain un@@ covered until you have no protection in your computer . nobody ever seems to have it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is much more secure than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transfers , since they produce interaction within the data stream , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by games problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mist@@ akes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates to be able to handle and highly scal@@ able license for Solaris and Leopard . we only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its super@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still using the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechan@@ isms which are used for &amp; Linux ; but it is still not part of the core .
it does not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the losses in not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . for not@@ ebooks , the proportion of the@@ ft is 50 % .
loss of data loss because of viruses is less common than most cases . it is currently limited to lower damage , such as the@@ ft or new installations . and it is currently only limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent mis@@ ru@@ p@@ te data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the trial process is higher and an un@@ defined status is not completely stored before the problem is not completely stored before the problem is lost .
viruses include the greatest thre@@ at of digital data : wrong , the@@ ft and human error , the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are located 1 @-@ 2 aperture values of fundamental physical limits . there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and rob@@ ber@@ ation for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of the 10 Meg@@ apixels . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more comfortable for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Megapixel . for higher resol@@ utions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not require any other loss of data loss . so , if you have any data loss in any data loss . so ass@@ ure your data often after a plan and test it any more dangerous than the re@@ installation of your operating system to make the exchange of disks or change of hard drives .
supp@@ ose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash gives you happiness when the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster suggest@@ s locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ lines : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ ft are dangerous enough for your data or a whole room or the whole house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ pre@@ ven@@ ation always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neigh@@ b@@ ors , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as described above is a common reason for any data loss despite f@@ use the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and pos@@ es a complete copy at a time .
differential : a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete system . creates a complete snap@@ shot to two intervals : the complete safety and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of files that have been changed since last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . this backup is made back to one such backup . this backup will only be retri@@ eved in the next one with the exception that it is only decre@@ asing and not going on .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily copy to your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts . this is actually compressed and if you want to increase your safety about ssh .
ass@@ ure important images directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this approach brings you enough time to discover and restore action . at the same time , you come to the f@@ use and get back to the same time . at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have completed a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , associated images stored in image files , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ loc@@ ating images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , vis@@ ibility , ... , use of the Internet .
with that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , it &apos;s about the time that you really interested in you are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strateg@@ ies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you have to consider what is said today . unfortunately , there are no other possibility to manage and rate ones@@ elf every day . in less variants you are used in the past , so easier to ass@@ ess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the explanation of the explanation in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : any@@ how when you change your computer architecture , your memory and back@@ ing technology , you should review your library and if necessary to convert newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
let &apos;s go out that you have to have the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to put on a dedicated record or partition . at * n@@ ix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and put it on a new record :
check with the dm@@ es@@ g command if your new record has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it on .
&amp; USD ; dd if = / dev / SD@@ B &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; Dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ er@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can be read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier to make this task a year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format which slowly dis@@ appears from the market .
PNG has been created as an open source standard . but it can store a lot more . it is los@@ s@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata . it is possible to save gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ ity data for a improved colour assignment of h@@ eter@@ ogen@@ eous platforms , but not as many as the present and a slow compression . this format would like to recommend you to saving your pictures .
TIFF was widespread as a picture format . it can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ free compression rate . a problem is , however , you can print your pictures in this format . it is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open frame image that was developed by Adobe Systems . DNG was developed now for using met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera controller is now available , and we hope to use the compet@@ itor Canon and Nikon as well .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe &apos;s XML based X@@ MP technology has introduced to &amp; quot ; Cin@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF ; the file information will be allowed with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers drag@@ ging it before a original of your photo , mostly stored in the raw file , because it is possible to archive the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file , and the image files will come and see if you are using to use if you use the container as container and place it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation offering a wide range of applications and business models . among the activities of DC@@ MI &apos;s work on architecture and mod@@ elling activities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and workshops , standard connections and workshops to achieve a further acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert Roh@@ files to DNG and save them in your repository . this function is not yet implemented .
for fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were taken from the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark . export it in web pages , add in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; in the section you will find a description as you can already add on your hard drive , but the camera interface makes you a lot of advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; connect it to the computer , switch on the display mode and turn it on display . another description of this camera will be found in the hand@@ book of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ oci@@ ous indicator show at the bottom end and the examples of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the filename and a symbol of file extensions will be displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information form to any entry . with the side@@ bars and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information to be stored intern@@ ally of the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . NOTE that some digital cameras wouldn &apos;t be available any information .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer note , GPS , etc of image files . those information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar of the main window of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; or the image processing . NOTE that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available for some digital cameras .
the eas@@ iest way to download photos on your computer is downloading , click on the button to download and then download the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; . downloading the photos will be downloaded and we will be sure to delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos download , you can only select the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you select the selected photos you will use the button to download and select Selected . the button selected is as long as you have selected to select some photos .
if your camera is supported this , an option is now available . these images have not yet been selected by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; downloaded . in this case , the new pictures have been selected by a star in advance . if you select this option , the new pictures will be downloaded .
when you are using the buttons , you can download all of the selected albums , where you can download the target album , displayed as normal folder , displayed in the folder . details for folder ass@@ ure can be found in the section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete all of you from the camera . if you want to delete all files you wish to delete a few , so you must delete these first and delete check out .
please note that there are no possible photos that you have been deleted from the camera , you will need to delete whether the photos will be completely er@@ ased out if you want to delete the photos from the camera . if you are completely er@@ ased out of the camera , you should be able to delete it over the camera image , because this is much faster .
cameras use as a filename for the photos frequently will not be util@@ ized after the photos from the camera . this can be mean@@ ing@@ ful if you can load photos of different recording items in the same album , so it can be mean@@ ing@@ ful , the date and time , to integr@@ ate the image in the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and ske@@ wer image quality . if you use this latter option , automatically create a folder a day .
the options during the transfer opens three more options , which are carried out before the photos can be saved on the record . if you select this , the respective entries are copied from the EX@@ IF data into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % M : add the option date &amp; time . for further adjustment you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file names , you have the opportunity to change the filename in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; is used for a photo , is being stored below the name , and the camera will be stored in the Preview and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to set up a automatic swing while running out . not all cameras are ready to use . in the section bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information you have embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , you will use the automatic lathe up and select the automatic rotation in the lower range of the window .
when your camera has been made information about the date , which is made available to you , you can download &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; this subst@@ itute will be stored in the target album . all images with the same date will be shown in the same sub@@ title . in the section Side@@ bar met@@ a data , you can consult , which information may have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually disabled , and in this case , you will need to change this option . if you want to change this option , you need to set this option on it and select the date @-@ based lower at the bottom end of the window .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to load photos from their computer to load them is the button to download . choose up@@ loading . you can select the file select dialog &amp; k@@ de ; you can also select the up@@ loaded file . you can also choose more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you , where the pictures will be up@@ loaded , select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term being used in this document , which is indicated on a map which can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not just for professional photographer you can associ@@ ate an image with an accurate geograph@@ ic place . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ ing an area by automatic recording of GPS data to kar@@ to@@ graf@@ ting . environmental pl@@ anner , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can view the area by clicking the area . if you want to loc@@ ate a postcard to another &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; user you can loc@@ ate the location of the photos , it is good to loc@@ ate the position data of a photo .
the question is what is the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 are many GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and map reference to the geograph@@ ic assignment of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geograph@@ ic assignment ( manual ) and most of the manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera which has integrated a GPS unit , but there are a few that work with GPS receivers together or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Kodak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , these data must be stored in g@@ px format as this is the only format supported by the module for geograph@@ ic assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ rel@@ ate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and lat@@ itu@@ dinal shift or other data , you can use this script that works with the if@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey , for example , it uses the signs to be created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .

this page contains how shown below , the service did@@ ac@@ ity and copyright data . these data are automatically selected into the relevant IP@@ TC data fields . when the option is selected to download the camera interface , these data will be selected into the IP@@ TC fields .
aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for author header : this field should be the job title of the photographer . this may be a photographer or independent photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer . since this is a closer description of the car field , it must be full .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors : use this field to give the photo . this is not to be the author for example , if this photo is a stock photo , then if the image is a warehouse image , then the group or agency should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC promot@@ ions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thus it is achieved that the met@@ ad@@ ata are constantly contained in the database and are not only available in the database of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; and these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; imports without being lost .
pictures as embedded lab@@ elling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures , save the comments , which you can add to your photos , with the images created in the images . thus , these lab@@ elling can also contain from other image locations , are over@@ written by the account of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; over@@ written .

the default settings can be reset again by clicking the button up@@ dating right of each category .
the settings of the illumin@@ ator of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; can only be set on this page . some pictures have to be switched on this page . some pictures you have set different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get a better result .
by default , the picture processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . this method can be specified here . in the image processing , this method can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .

with setting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as you have a los@@ s@@ free algorith@@ m . if you have a fast computer , you can reset this value to a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option TIFF @-@ files you can connect the de@@ fl@@ ate compression sal@@ g@@ ing@@ m for TIFF pictures . this reduces the size of the TIFF @-@ images . it does not have an impact on the image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ m is los@@ sy @-@ free .
with the loss of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save low loss . even if you have been posted loss of quality loss and file size far better than when this paragraph is written , met@@ ad@@ ata were not yet supported but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the picture processing was only a viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to manip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing .
the default util@@ ization is that all green pixels are immediately connected to ultra@@ violet light when using this option , dis@@ solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option records a little soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh @-@ pattern with the V@@ N@@ G- or an A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance is used . otherwise , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is it a solid color balance , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card , based on the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras . the user &apos;s the second sensors has the effect that the lower images will get more details in the tip . for other cameras , this option is ig@@ no@@ red .
the standard is the high @-@ edge , so the parts of your camera will begin to catch the pointed out of your camera leading to the in@@ ability of your camera . you can try to re@@ con@@ stru@@ ct some parts of the shooting in various ros@@ es . at least , you can try to re@@ design some parts of the missing informations .
this is possible because blue pixels is not so fast as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; and d@@ cra@@ b try to re@@ design the missing green and red shares of the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you will get the option to set a level . this is a value of three com@@ promise and can therefore be customized for each picture .
add the Lumin@@ aire value to your taste . you &apos;ll probably need to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be obtained later in the image options of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; -@@ image processing , you should proceed to the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital picture process to get a complete picture of the partial data being used , which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of color transparent . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; and D@@ cra@@ w make you three altern@@ atives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation , and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive hom@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity direction ) , the first algorith@@ m was created by D@@ cra@@ b . he produces color art@@ ef@@ iel@@ ding on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
if you know the color de@@ viation of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can set the red and blue screen values here . this is certainly the best method for a color application correction since you are carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color form@@ ations and releases how they should be given up like this . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; information like the colour space from a colour space to the opposite are thus the colours as possible .
behaviour Ask , when a picture is opened in the picture processing , start / color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Click here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; exam@@ ines the file then during the list .
on the ICC profiles , you have here the option &amp; quot ; Standard squ@@ ot ; can be left for your profile . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cal@@ ib or Arg@@ yl@@ l . here are only your pictures and does not run the entire screen .
the input profiles should be fitted to the camera type and model that you are using . not all profiles are shown on the same type . currently correc@@ ts d@@ cra@@ w Gamma not for converting at 16 bits depth . this means that you must carry out the colour m@@ apping itself .
there are more options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate , like your image of one device would be back , as your printer has been printed a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated , rather than to rely on the flash algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious to what colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not for the models of Canon . therefore , this follows a table of cameras and profiles . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion can be found the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Ne@@ utral , P for scre@@ ams and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing ; many modules are supported to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . then select the list of available modules . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window of the main window and in addition , you will also find a look at the context menu of the menu .
short commands for tasks that are done by modules can be rev@@ amped in the menu under Settings .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be found in htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the video outputs , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other An@@ cruc@@ ible switch off the met@@ ad@@ ata or off , which are inserted at the lower end of the images during the display .
the camera functions are displayed on the left side of a list of all supported cameras . on the right side above , there is a button automatic detection , which is att@@ empt@@ ed to identify a camera , which are currently connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , there are Serial , US@@ B- and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / order , please enter your camera .
to use &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am your digital camera , you need to connect and turn the camera to your computer .
check if &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the camera automatically detect . if not , you can set your camera or manually set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any number of your camera for your camera . if you have more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the confir@@ ming settings dialog for the shif@@ ter of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can set up a look at an album . in the sections of a photos and del@@ eting one album you will find more details .
ed@@ itorial changes through the right side bar can be used tac@@ tically by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; apply if you are using changes in the right side bar without any quer@@ ies . otherwise you have to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also enter the display of the welcome screen image by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; while starting up . this acceler@@ ates the start procedure of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; .
setting up searching for new photos is forced &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am , looking for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; if something from the base file was deleted , asks &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you , if it shall delete it from the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . you can select Settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you will find further information on this tutorial .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ on ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and improve your photos . the picture processing can be started by clicking on the left mouse button on the preview and selection of the details displays / Edit menu .
the picture processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; so you are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be installed in the section screen .
a flag line at the lower edge of the window , the filename , current filename , magn@@ ification and the current picture size indicates .
a menu bar at upper edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing of the picture processing changes your photos . however , the original photo will change the original photo before using file Save or button saving of the tool@@ bar . NOTE that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , once you have saved the picture .
so you should possibly produce a copy of your image , before you can change it . you can save with file Save .
as long as you have not saved the image , you can restore the original image by installing from the menu file , recover from the menu window . you will lose any changes you have done in the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting the editing or restore re@@ produce from the menu .
if you are using this often , you should get Ctrl ; -@@ z for revers@@ ing and Ctrl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press the back button in the tool@@ bar at a moment . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can use the navigation bar in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation bar in the tool@@ bar . if you have any changes in the current picture , you will be asked if you want to back up .
you can use it in the picture and zoom in Ctrl ; Mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the c@@ auti@@ ous menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magn@@ ifying transfer automatically
view Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode . usually , you will not want to use the Es@@ c key . usually , you can call this in the settings dialog by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you can call this in the settings dialog by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; main window . see the section on setup of image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; printed settings . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole movements . all pictures can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the images from the menu album exports . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the image window ; main window displays a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promot@@ ions for the selected image files . the same side bar is available without the navigation file , also displayed if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple times click on the same tab the side bar will appear or dis@@ appear in the edge .
in the let@@ tering view , you can insert let@@ tering with unlimited size or insert it . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels can be copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC Fields which can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 signs and are produced by special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC lab@@ elling field in other applications , you should consider these restri@@ ctions .
after which you have comm@@ ented them , use either the button , or change easily to the next image , the labels will then be stored .
next to the use button , there is a button more . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata in the selected file or the database . but this will always be carried out if you have selected a met@@ ad@@ ata setting that will always be written into the images .
the section rating shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars . it can be used in a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the short@@ cuts of the side bar . to rate several pictures at the same time , select these from and use the text menu .
the evaluation is in the IP@@ TC field urg@@ ency . the coding follows the diagram in the following table :
the key@@ word index shows a search box for fil@@ tering of the key@@ word , the subject index and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; session occupied this words .
the subject index is adjusted as dynamic as a key@@ word . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of options when looking for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief for input at a picture series . if you have entered different pass@@ words , these are stored for quick access .
pass@@ words can also be placed in the tree as well . all the key words are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you can select a key@@ word in the subject index and do not apply to the entire selection , if you want a selection using a head@@ word , please read the index bul@@ let@@ in .
the side@@ bar index is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - data , index and search engines . if in addition one or more bul@@ let@@ ting filters are used , only the cut volume is displayed on the right side . all created keywords are available .
you can also pull and cool down . supp@@ ose you have selected multiple pictures when the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . next you will ask if you want to reset the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the subject index is set to no query , which has been selected on three images . they were set by Ctrl + a and put it here . a dialogue is asking whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place with any start of the program . it can also be switched on different settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it can be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry according to which in the database is sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that has already been set in the database .
you can also specify a wid@@ est search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button options . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted to &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you set a color@@ less modified workflow is that the colors show you from your camera or scanner . with a colour @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve the colors on your monitor from your camera or the colors you want to print or publish them in the web . publish them from your digital night@@ chamber .
if the subject goes on color management , everyone wants to know what buttons must be done for the results he wants to provide you with deep background information about color management . in addition , you should make you more information about color management . in addition , you should make information about your own information decisions so that you can obtain the required result .
if your image is executed all six below criteria , you must not wor@@ ry about color management .
you are working in a monitor of the s@@ RGB color space ( further information below ) .
your only other image editions have been sent by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB is doing so well and life for everyone makes it so easy , why should one use another colour space and make thought of colour p@@ amp@@ ons ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can see is shown below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional presentation of all colours that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ de@@ formation region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional presentation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour space , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ence page and then click information About RGB working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to vibr@@ ate my monitor if I have decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
Yes ! if you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to get your monitor lined your monitor . if you &apos;re using a RGB space using s@@ RGB , you will need to vibr@@ ate your monitor on s@@ RGB using s@@ RGB , using either monitor using the s@@ RGB standard or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before using a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , dis@@ like , Automatic and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction try to experiment the best from your colours . they are experim@@ enting with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method c@@ asser@@ ts the whole picture above the whole picture , so the dark point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ aded . this function is often a magical correc@@ ting for images that are dark or balanced .
abstract : this method adjust the brightness of the selected image , so the hist@@ ogram of intensity in size is as flat as possible . thus , this results in order to achieve a very powerful operation that either works wonders on an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic off : this method maxim@@ izes color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determin@@ es the dark and bright front sh@@ ades and adjust the red , green and blue buttons on the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast enlar@@ ging the method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values by moving the lowest and highest values on the highest possible area and a re@@ fr@@ action of all values d@@ az@@ w@@ ipe . this is only visible when selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad pictures .
the white balance of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the white balance correction is a bit limited to a colour space with 8 bit per colour . in case you can perform it too far from the original image , in case you can perform the white balance in drawing mode , so your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance and protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it on the menu entry colors white balance of the picture processing .
the loop thing can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side you can see both the original image and preview of the target group . if you want to see the original wh@@ en@@ ever you want to look back the original image , then click on the window .
the preview of the target pictures has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the image below this mar@@ kers is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right up@@ stairs is a hist@@ ogram , once you have a parameter change . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels is very small lumin@@ aires . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or what is displayed . the sum becomes Lumin@@ ous .
the contrast of your result depends on the shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or download the attend@@ ance details of your photos .
An@@ st@@ at with the above controls , you should use the colour temperature pip@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the picture preview for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance . on this type the temperature and green values will be set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one colour channel is exposed . this will display the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and does not have an effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and loading are exactly this . each setting of the white balance will set you to save and re@@ load them back in one text file .
the knob adjust@@ ments all filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white balance . see also neutral settings as your original . when you save it , your original image will be changed .
here you can adjust the coding per colour channel of the revised image format . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding is also required for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ dings are also needed for PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be applied to the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu of color and color correction . this tool allows you to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always take you the same error and therefore you can always find the same correction .
a powerful way to correct ventilation program is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Tools F@@ arbe@@ et effects introduces four colour effects , a py@@ via filter , a neon effect and an edge filter .
in times of the chemical processing , solar cells was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of which has been replaced by the extra light . the result was a partial neg@@ atives of the image . this tool was a partial negative effects of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar cells . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase is generated only a negative image that is not generated on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vid filters sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ Eff@@ ect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that makes it a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth . simply try to em@@ bell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a colour optim@@ ised colour of the Japanese company Fuj@@ if@@ ilm ; and thus a reference for its smooth screen structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly represents the film of choice for nature photograph@@ ers . Vel@@ vi@@ as are also some photographer , especially those of which are hardly any landscapes .
the neon filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light at the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and shift gear . when using large images the filter can cut the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common to change the color @-@ effects of your photos with the tools in the menu . once you are pleased with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you make a photo of poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem . even in this case , you can increase the satur@@ ation . all changes you can see in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the result with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple light intensity / contrast / Gamma is the tool needed to improve the expos@@ ing . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need for the field of shooting . specific the three shif@@ ter below the hist@@ o@@ program .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , of the active channel or of the selected area . under the graph , three shif@@ ts are cli@@ cked , to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side of light areas .
the eas@@ iest way to learn operation is to move the regulator and look for sure how the picture changes .
on the right side you can see the original and preview of the image . the preview is dynamic , updated on the left side of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
scal@@ ing : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is displayed . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic release is useful .
three controls : the top spot for dark tones , medium for bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often gam@@ ma@@ values often called .
the three colour p@@ ushes can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the input values of the shadow , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is one button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow to change the selection values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values . for example , the compression of output can be used e.g. , for example , to create something else in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and store : using these buttons can be stored and re@@ loaded later , the Gim@@ p levels are used later .
if you use this mode and use the three color pip@@ et , you will adjust the color pip@@ ette automatically for all sh@@ adows , medium and sun blocks , and click on the preview of the hist@@ o@@ program for rot@@ - , green , blue and light beam .
the an over@@ load cell dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to show over@@ exposed pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels . this is what you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final results .
below is an example of the alignment values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , and output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target screen is displayed . the preview will be updated automatically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modif@@ ier channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel which is al@@ tered by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode is higher .
for example , if you move a short vent@@ ing to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that this bright tones will correspon@@ d to a dark tones and the corresponding picture pixel are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark visible . if you change this markings on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off , until the value is adjusted after your taste .
save as and loading : with these buttons you can make exactly this . every curve you can create and loaded with the file system and later the file format is the Gim@@ p cur@@ ven@@ format .
if you are using this method and the three color pip@@ et buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun . please click the original image to set the control points for the rotary , green , blue and Lumin@@ ous curve .
the an over@@ load cell dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than a channel over@@ exposed aggregate can be found , you &apos;ll get the effect only displayed in preview and it is no effect on the final results .
below , you can see a black and white photo that was correc@@ ted in the Lumin@@ ous channel . shadow and sun was applied to the colour pip@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and it correc@@ ted ( 2 ) .
the Channel Mixer of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing is a tool to improve the channels and change color sh@@ aded images .
the Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix colour sh@@ ades of images . you can process it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first reference like you can correct the relative distribution and impact . the left side of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison to your own rider .
the preview of the target pictures has a red marker . if you can position this in the picture a vertical line of the hist@@ ogram order to display the corresponding colour value .
checks for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction , you can easily change these channels . if you want to re@@ activate the visible color components , since you can also select the screen for creating great black @-@ white converter from your photos . try the green channel for black and white portra@@ its .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rom@@ atic , the reduction of a colour is visible in the same place in the colour channel , and whose noise can be different in every channel . if this is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom@@ atic conversion thus in which you can reduce the far@@ my@@ space .
the store and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any kind of mixer can save you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the an over@@ load cell dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to show over@@ exposed pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels . this is what you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final results .
below you can see a photo in the blue channel . option Lumin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating , because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography it is black / white one step , since color pictures can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film rol@@ lers .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white movie sigh@@ ting with a green lens filter . this looks more well , among all the scen@@ eries and fits very well to portra@@ its against heaven . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter .

Se@@ pi@@ aton : creates warm bright and middle tones used to add a bit of cold in the sh@@ ad@@ option . this is very similar to the trial of a print and repeat development in a pi@@ pe@@ an . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus much of the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) pi@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; server tex@@ ture , you can apply Decor@@ ative tex@@ tures on an image .
by adding a tex@@ ture to your image , regardless of whether it is a colour image , or not , you can look like a painting of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged dots or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image tex@@ ture can be used for this image .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the depth or three @-@ dimensional tex@@ ture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ tu@@ re@@ ff@@ ect is shown on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changes in ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
adding the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photos is not a slight task . this is to keep its attention to the image . this is a psychological bar@@ rier for dis@@ covering eye . under the frame the module can be launched out of image processing .
type : with this parameter you set up the desired frame type for your picture . immediately converted the picture with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , converting it with a nice three @-@ dimensional setting of ideal for a touch frame with patterns .
width : specif@@ ies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but it is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool by aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert easy @-@ format text into a picture at any point . this also goes on multiple places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply use text shape , orientation , color from the color space and character set . the larger the picture , the larger the character set you need . to finish it , you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . this image is ready .
each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you have saved on the button &quot; OK &quot; after the picture is saved once the picture is part of the picture . it cannot be changed .
using the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you can apply a template on a picture using the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool template .
the picture below st@@ encil template used in image processing can be used to create a picture of a picture .
for a st@@ encil there is no restri@@ ctions in size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file format and should be to add the PNG format ( 9 ) to reduce your st@@ encil files . if you want to add your st@@ encil template to you , send us an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; mail@@ ing@@ list dig@@ ik@@ am @-@ Users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your st@@ encil with the button bas@@ ord@@ er in the dialog . select the folder in which you will have st@@ acked the st@@ encil files .
after the root ord@@ ner for the st@@ enc@@ ils , a tree view is reflected in the st@@ acked setting of st@@ encil . selecting an folder will be updated automatically by the templates .
under the Preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magn@@ ification and change your image .
enlarge : this knob increases the present image . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
reduction : this button is smaller than this image . if you want to use the mouse . if you want to use the mouse , you must remove the image accordingly . check the image accordingly .
move Close button : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and set it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to use the template onto your image . the picture will be adjusted automatically .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has pre@@ ference in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very quick and simple , but it is , particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
Un@@ shadow mask is going to look at the contrast of the edges to make a painting . they can use it &apos;s more psych@@ ovis@@ ual Dun@@ st . they can use it &apos;s a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gim@@ p and is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised pictures need a correction of the sharpness . this is why this means that the digital phen@@ omen@@ on can be printed on paper . the same phen@@ omen@@ on can be printed on paper . SLR cameras does usually need more subsequently than normal cameras for private users .
at JPEG pictures , a camera in internal sharpen@@ ing has been widely used . images in the raw file must always be sharpen@@ ed in case of processing .
some scanner has a sharpen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by taking a photo with the sharpen@@ ing value . you can also call the menu entry .
however , you should move slowly , because the results are not very natural : the focus increases the sharpness of the edges , but inten@@ sif@@ ting the noise . in general , you can focus more information and on the menu entry . you can also find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a bit soft to sharpen@@ ing , is much easier than it . use the tool to remove the switch with the menu entry kor@@ rig@@ ate and experiment with you the effect on your photo .
the filter Im@@ p Mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove ve@@ il from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help you edit the image . the show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount should be tried first . if you produce the Un@@ ity Mask , h@@ ides and produce the impression of gr@@ ats near sharp edges .
the radius is a lot of pixels which are affected on each side of a edge through the filters . high resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . therefore , you should focus on the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the managed picture which is added to the original . thus the starch is set .
the threshold value is a split from the maximum RGB value and using the differential amount . thus , the areas can be applied to a edge of the filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones above and therefore clearly avoided in faces , belie@@ vers and water surface .
this is an example of the harm@@ less@@ to@@ graph filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this picture has been applied ( 2 ) . the original image has been applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the image Editing ; Tool Re@@ fo@@ kus is foc@@ using on image by improving the sharpness . it was used by copyright protected air @-@ irrit@@ ation filter algorith@@ m by Ernst Lipp@@ e .
this tool is trying to reverse a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed quot ; in which there is a technique called FI@@ R Vienna fil@@ tering . this is easily better to sharpen@@ ing images . help can start better results than sk@@ ill@@ ation . you can proceed from the menu by launching colors on image processing .
in practice , the circuit works much better than the pal@@ ate &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche has a very long tail , which results in the mathem@@ ati@@ cal results , which is widely affected by the original qu@@ ell@@ art@@ es , which will result in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . the causes un@@ wanted results .
circular sharpness : this is the radius of circular shape . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures you should set a higher value if your image should be very in@@ ot@@ able , but if your image should be very in@@ ot@@ able .
cor@@ relation : an increase of cor@@ relation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected by 0 @-@ 1 . values are from 1 , and eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation does not reduce the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the room filter can ass@@ ume you to reduce evil factors . however , values can be reduced by 0 @-@ 1 . however , values can be low as 0.1 only rarely . if the noise is very bad . a value of value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still further poll@@ uted by the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos; s sharpness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche . this is most frequently used to avoid this value to 0 . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 , so you might have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ ith : this value determin@@ es the size of transformation format . an increase of the transformation size can be set good results , especially if you select big values for the circular sharpness or the Gau@@ ß . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Stor@@ ing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any item @-@ focused parameters will be stored for later and then can be loaded .
try all supplements , color and intensity dots on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture anywhere else . the reason for this is that much operations which are not instantly visible , but later dis@@ agre@@ eable ar@@ te@@ facts .
when you read and compress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should use the module to un@@ compressed image .
in general , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ine produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by means of ind@@ ul@@ ting a larger neighborhood used for sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it has to create evil meas@@ les . even under optimal conditions , it can never be the effect of the in@@ spir@@ ing filter . for the Vien@@ nese filter it is always at least as good as the non@@ fer@@ mentation mask . the FI@@ R Wiener filter is often better at the editing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small , focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be correc@@ ted . this image has been made using a analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is attri@@ but@@ able to the auto focus lens .
for more information on the focus on the focus of digital pictures , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator in the regulator app@@ re@@ lies the in@@ spir@@ ing of the area which was ob@@ sc@@ ured for a naturally pure pupp@@ y .
the color tin@@ te allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . in case you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented speed .
the Indian algorith@@ m was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS labor@@ atories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes several pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simp@@ lif@@ y the restoration . the currently available settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the Reiter and advanced settings .
Detailed instructions p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a smooth Gl@@ acier above the picture . what a value of 0.9 should be respec@@ ted for details . please note that no sharpen@@ ing should be necessary . please note that the details can always be m@@ apped in detail .
direction depend@@ ency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . you will create a high @-@ wave pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best elim@@ inated for a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . p then define the relative gl@@ ac@@ ification . thus , set this value matching the level of space in your image .
regul@@ ar@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies to bigger structures . the higher value is required , the more is more smooth , as it is hard to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ent effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repeat : on how often the algorith@@ m is run through . usually 1 or 2 can be enough .
variable stri@@ pping width since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : first @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is very small , then ensure that small angle can produce a long running time . thus , you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs .
integr@@ ating stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated ped@@ aling range in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never exceed 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : this more on quality you can get by choosing this option is only low . but it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him to allow him .
the buttons Save and store exactly this . each setting of image errors can be correct and re@@ loaded later in a text file .
image errors can be compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load . this allows you to break the calculation anytime with the button .
below , you can see such image errors with little arti@@ facts . the module is shown on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera which is made in Guatemala City with a bad film storage during the trip was made ( 1 ) to see and correc@@ ted the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the dig@@ ging ; diamond @-@ induc@@ tion is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise . it uses a cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool allows selectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair from the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ es from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ac@@ ute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on the digital cameras from digital cameras , so you can read them in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ dient cra@@ wler that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window of advanced settings may remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) up to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter per pixel and can be spo@@ iled for the filter per pixel . the image is sli@@ pped over the image and colour in it is gl@@ itter@@ ing and thus smaller faul@@ ts adjusted .
focus : controls the sharpen@@ ing level . this value sets the pixel pitch shif@@ ting . if it is raised to adjust the edges of the filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details cannot receive , noise or lubric@@ ating .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness . this value improves the frequency response . if it is too strong , you can not remove all the noise if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change an image . these settings influence the gl@@ itter@@ ing process of the images controlled by the details .
color : controls the color toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings influence the gl@@ itter@@ ing process of the images controlled by the details .
gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker ranges , but typically consum@@ es the shadow areas .
atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ absor@@ b . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur at the edges . he may remove rob@@ ber@@ y and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are being used for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have placed can be stored in the file system and later charged .
this is an example how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and it correc@@ ted ( 2 ) and it was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a bit soft to sharpen@@ ing , is fortunately much easier than a picture to draw out , and experiment with the glu@@ ten . this makes the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; photo re@@ stau@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools for photograph@@ ing photo files .
this filter for the re@@ stau@@ ration gives you the possibility to emer@@ ge a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts , film varnish , scrat@@ ches , compression @-@ file and local errors that makes the images taken along the image con@@ tours and thus obtain the content such as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and tex@@ ture . the tex@@ ture is performed with another tool , the image correction is performed by the IMAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS labor@@ atories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ nuts and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
to reduce JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts : compression by JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it is even very far away . as a los@@ e@@ worthy compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards which are to correct the un@@ compressed image . this setting can correct these problems .
the buttons Save and store exactly this . every setting of photo re@@ stau@@ ration can be stored and re@@ loaded later in a text file .
photo re@@ stau@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load . this allows you to break the calculation anytime with the button .
at the bottom , you can reduce the image of a photo with a layer of noise when using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ or@@ ious film gritt among the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see a further example of the photo re@@ stau@@ ration . this time , Tex@@ tures can reduce on an old color photo , which causes the scan arti@@ facts and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the Hot@@ pixel &apos;s &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Tools Hot@@ pixel are allowed to remove images from photos that are used with a CCD camera , which are using algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem , because many cameras have a built @-@ in re@@ pression of hot pixels using JPEG compression .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image contrac@@ tion method . there is no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool becomes automatic and brigh@@ ter pixels . these are high@@ ligh@@ ted in the image show .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to take you the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the right dark image to correct image . an automatic processing of the dark image will be found to see the last dark picture and re@@ charges this automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview can help you correct the image . the fore@@ ster indicates the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixel are emphas@@ ized in all outside areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters .
thir@@ teen : an average of the neigh@@ bour is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels which have a distance of 1 pixel pitch , comes to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or are used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective p@@ ix in the block .
quad@@ r@@ atic : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a spacing of 2 or less to calculate , a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the p@@ ix in the block .
Ku@@ b@@ isch : all pixels with a spacing of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic meters ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective p@@ ix in the block .
at the bottom , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ing , showing the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted picture is below ( 2 ) .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; Vign@@ es@@ etting correction is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ ops , that is to correct the corners .
wide angle lens , in particular , in the middle and large photo format , can &apos;t even illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the light the sensor there . tele@@ photo lenses also show this behavior .
but it has also draw@@ backs . many Center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which is impossible to hold the necessary sealing time , even with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise im@@ fer@@ ing effects are caused by movement .
with the great exposure areas of today &apos;s filters and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ less and sim@@ ulates the transformation with a Center@@ point on a picture . the algorith@@ m is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three re@@ gl@@ ers , you can control the right @-@ release filter correction and with three further expos@@ ing of the target pictures .
density : this parameter controls the level of light beam at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , or random@@ ly adjust the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vign@@ ets to compens@@ ate it to compens@@ ate it to a small degrees .
Illumin@@ ation , Con@@ tr@@ ast and Gamma Settings : the editing with the correction of the Pixel . you need to adjust the expos@@ ing of the target pictures with these options . the knob adjust@@ s you only positive values as you need to increase the settings .
if you want an enemy re@@ adjustment of the purposes , you let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma to zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vign@@ es@@ etting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ ted picture in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ ted picture . a lumin@@ aire and contra@@ sting correction was also carried out with this tool .
the dig@@ ging ; lens dist@@ or@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool runs with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . color cor@@ ps cannot be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree contains the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion of the lens and can correct the concave or conv@@ ex shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third gra@@ dient has a similar monitoring effect , but fl@@ att@@ ened on the edges . this bug is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth part correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion can be elim@@ inated .
General : this value controls the strength of dist@@ or@@ tion second degree . with negative values , t@@ onn@@ en@@ ary de@@ zer@@ es can be correc@@ ted and positive values are cr@@ ushed into dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of dist@@ or@@ tion fourth degree . this value is stronger in edges as in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the parameter parameter has the revers@@ al signs of the parameter of parameters .
Zoom : this value scal@@ ed the picture size and thereby conduc@@ ts a correction of the first degree . negative values increase to positive the picture .
brigh@@ ter : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated in the dialog with a preview the error correction . the values you are using for your picture will be stored and used for the next start as default values .
the t@@ onn@@ aire re@@ sp. cor@@ on@@ ical correction should be carried out in front of all aggreg@@ ates or size changes . if you perform a picture and then carry out a t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction would be the effect to be ready .
to help you find the best correction to find you this tool a vertical and a horizontal relie@@ ving line . move it on an important place , like e.g. the se@@ abed or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . afterwards , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ aire / cop@@ ular dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you are correc@@ ting a ver@@ ified frame , the resulting picture of black ends is generated by the dot @-@ tool in the menu , cut the images from the picture processing or via the zoom control of this dialog .
for most pictures , the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction from . the next logical step for some mot@@ ifs , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , it is like to correct the brightness in the picture of 90 degrees . NOTE that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight dist@@ or@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted the correc@@ ted picture ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see the URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can preview the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below allows you to sim@@ ulate two parameters of film pieces and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO knob allows you to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny tex@@ ture of a highly sensitive film material and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyl@@ l in nature ) in the conversion . green me@@ adows are white as snow !
because the filters are used to produce red infrared film , especially the kale leaves makes it not sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , since the color form@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of the infrared film maker , applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set at ( 1 ) and this image ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the top .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; Filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film licenses on your images , such as the B / W Kodak Tri @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films by making the manufacturer large silver gra@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ ins effect gives you a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a tim@@ eless atmosphere . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photograph@@ ic , gra@@ ined look especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , so you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated for control of the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the gra@@ ins . although more commonly higher values are needed , if you need more gra@@ ins , you can turn the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ dation on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this was the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the oil paintings ; oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a cop@@ y@@ righ@@ tly protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the s@@ dig@@ ik@@ am ; Filter Oil paintings gives its digital images a nice appearance like an oil paintings . natural pictures and sty@@ list@@ ic live are good for this effect .
there are two control knob to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the pin @-@ size between one and five . thick@@ er brush are superior to big images . smooth or , from the other side view , hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the paper is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and glu@@ ed 17 .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter coal as@@ sign use color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon roller . it is useful when you imagine the Um@@ ris@@ se in drawing are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you have chosen to sk@@ etch you . this would have good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob elec@@ ts the pin @-@ size and the lower adjust the contrast ( Gl@@ am ) .
this is an example of the high performance filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the result settings are 30 and 10 . the result can be further improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter engraving has marked your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was used in wax . it uses a cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter engraving is a fast tool for giving your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the picture into a gray , mon@@ astic landscape .
the depth allows the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , is equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving Fil@@ tration . the original ( 1 ) and the processed depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art via tran@@ spl@@ ant effects . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .

wavel@@ ength 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 is dist@@ orted to the image here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art@@ work through im@@ fer@@ mentation effects . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom Un@@ sharp : sp@@ en@@ ches the image along star shaped lines that explo@@ ited from a centre . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ spir@@ ing camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often reflected in sports photography .
Radi@@ al Un@@ ity : sp@@ en@@ ches the image by rotating the pixels at a focus . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ spir@@ atory action of a shif@@ ting camera .
removing gri@@ ps : p@@ amp@@ er the picture to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
motion in@@ spir@@ ing : sp@@ ill the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ spir@@ ac@@ ies of a linear moving , z : b : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
the picture gets sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portra@@ its , gl@@ amour photos or add a warm and sub@@ tle g@@ low .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ er : sp@@ en@@ ches the image by random shif@@ ting of pixels and sim@@ ulates the in@@ spir@@ atory tract of a arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
Intelligent Un@@ ity : finds the col@@ our@@ ants in the picture and over@@ explo@@ ited this without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and then create , thanks to the filling with a mean pixel value .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . this calculation can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop are a nice small tool for making head@@ drops on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a modified figure by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m .
Tro@@ pf@@ en@@ code allows to change the size of the drop @-@ down . since the drop @-@ size does not automatically increase the size and density of drops . amount changes the quantity and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing with a range free of control drops , e.g. a vision that should remain free of freely . if you want to run the filter , the area will remain free of control drops .
this is an example of the regulator . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the illustrated picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
when the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the correct orientation . the tools can find tigh@@ tening or transformation mirror in the menu .
photo Bu@@ bbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo to enlarge in minimal loss of image quality .
image to zoom out is easy . the great question is , how can you be able to find an image while the bound@@ aries of the dis@@ solution ? how can you be found out or gu@@ ess the c@@ im@@ g algorith@@ m that is here a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
if you have a photo the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . choose a transformation size in the menu and specify the target read@@ ings . the dialog is below .
use the tool for size using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method for changing the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a image . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; uses a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorith@@ m Photo bu@@ bbles was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS labor@@ atories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
they must say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
maintain the aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the introduction of the new size is the aspect ratio of the original image ratio .
regul@@ ar@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies to bigger structures . the higher value is provided , the more is required if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons save as well as loading are used exactly . each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo Bu@@ bbles is very quick when it makes it , but it can last very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button .
below is shown below an example of photo bu@@ bbles by taking a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the larger image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magn@@ ification .
the cro@@ pping of a photos is not only a frequently executed operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to create a picture , simply by pressing the mouse button , by pressing the mouse button . you will then see this rec@@ t@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you let the mouse button go out , the field of photos will be cut off . thus you can change a good overview like your photo after the cutting area . you can easily draw the size of the square by adding a new rec@@ t@@ angle by clicking it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting button , use the button of the cutting button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( Ctrl ; + X ) . use the entries for storing or save file in the menu to save the re@@ directed photo .
in the area , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by shif@@ ting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog .
Set the orientation for aspect ratio and specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in the portrait format , the larger value of the height and in the horizontal format is assigned to width .
the tool According to aspect ratio uses a lateral ratio , regardless of whether you &apos;re cen@@ timet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . you can see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
on the right end of the Di@@ alog@@ es there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below the Max . relations with the Max . ratio button to cut the area for cro@@ pping on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen size and orientation .
the tool According to aspect ratio save his settings depending on the image processing ( horizontal or vertical ) , these settings are displayed as default in accordance with the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the EX@@ IF data , and not reflected the original image .
the settings of comp@@ ass@@ ing aid can help to include assistance to make your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ar@@ ances are based on the principle of simil@@ ar@@ ities . like the third the third tri@@ angles , a rec@@ t@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are aimed at the diagonal tri@@ angles .
golden Middle : the golden middle is a division among different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all possible things that we can feel nice .
the golden partition is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you was already used for the old Egyptians and Gre@@ eks . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you combine your pictures , buildings and even photographs to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is part of the Fibonacci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number after 1 is the equal numbers after 1 . the resulting part is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows is described as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle pos@@ es the smo@@ other aid lines when you con@@ stru@@ ct an image . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . in comparison to third party the Golden Spir@@ al creates the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a rule , however , is the right corner of the golden spiral , even golden rec@@ tang@@ les . this case can be used to produce the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this something can be simply because without having to guide the eye , it will accompl@@ ish its task .
the Golden Triangle shapes are also from the top mentioned Golden Spir@@ al . NOTE that in contrast to the harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not comparable to these lines . diagonal of these lines may be a static object dynamic .
when you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame , you will create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to create your photo paper at one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach .
the options horizontal and vertical mir@@ rors are used to mirror the harmon@@ ious spl@@ its .
with the button colour , you can set the color of help lines . in case you can see a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines may be visible . on this type you can custom@@ ize the colour of the lines your current picture .
the Free rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle .
when you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to fix the camera not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this is created with the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . choose the transformation of free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this teles@@ cope is set in grade . with the knob adjust@@ ments you can set the sli@@ der on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the right above .
at your help the module &apos;s free rotation puts a horizontal and a vertical line . after you move it over an important point of image , you can aff@@ ix it with a pressure to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is the function transformation from the picture processing .
an elegant way to tri@@ mming the image is the function Automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ al@@ i@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after turning . but consider the above warning .
all per@@ spek@@ tive trans@@ form@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is displayed in the center of the image and is represented by a red circle .
in order to change the perspective , you must use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which will help you to change your perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left at the top : shows the current angle in degrees on the top left of the trans@@ form@@ ulated area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees in the upper right corner of the trans@@ form@@ ulated area .
angles left down : displays the current angle in degrees in the lower left corner of the trans@@ form@@ ulated area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees in the lower right corner of the trans@@ form@@ ulated area .
after adjustment of perspective the picture gets a bit dirty . for a single adaptation is this effect small but two adjust@@ ments create a double as powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you will get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way this is the picture with trans@@ forming cro@@ pping from the picture processing .
this tool is used to shift a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part in the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted by other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle turns into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transformer .
she@@ ar your picture by using the horizontal corner and vertical corners . if you are able to press horizontal and vertical at the same time . a preview of the effects will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target range will be shown on the right .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line tri@@ umph . move the mouse to an important point , like e.g. the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines , to adjust your picture .
after which you have carried out , the image will be refresh@@ ed . for a single she@@ aring , this effect is usually neg@@ lig@@ ible , but two deposits are generated twice as much so@@ lic@@ ation and so you should avoid this .
after she@@ aring , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to elim@@ inate it is the picture with trans@@ forming cro@@ pping from the picture processing .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; requires a number of libraries and other packages for image formats , so that they are available from your system and in some cases , from the kind as these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ;
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats . but you will always find JPEG and TIFF ones .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; show only files in formats to the file extension . if the extension is listed on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the image processing , you can change the list of file extensions ; and you can change the file extensions . in the section configuration you will find further information .
virtually all digital cameras saved photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports both formats .
video compression is applied to digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smooth results as JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also be los@@ s@@ free if specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw material format , you can read more about Roh@@ em landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful hin@@ ts in English . you can find RAW format images in JPEG or TIFF using the RAW conversion of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; convert . in section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ b which is supported in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; all supported cameras can be found on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that are supported by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this clips are often saved in AVI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; does not under@@ take this formats and dig@@ ic@@ am ; if you want to make a film file , &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies to run the program for playback .
go forward with the previously visited album in the chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward if you go back before .

K@@ IP@@ I module produces a range of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initi@@ als has been very good , then you can carry out the first four Just@@ ices with the module white .
many tools that you need the photo processing are contained in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; contain your description here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , turn@@ out , Noise suppression , reverse effect , showing the effect on the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; Text@@ ur applicable &amp; quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress indicator shows the status of the filter to the current picture . left of him allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ational mode . these modes are :
ver@@ tically distri@@ but@@ ing without Dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected area .
horizontal parts with no Dup@@ lic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected area .
ver@@ tically split . the left section shows the original and the right to the effect of the filter .
horizontal . upper section shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ Mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the fo@@ aming area , and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show over@@ - and sub@@ section . the used colors can be customized in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image , and on the part of the image , you will see the Preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all modeling parts of the last use of the module are noticed .
the side@@ bar features displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo@@ properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when taking pictures . these data are from the EX@@ IF data if these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive @-@ search tool based on the Marble Cand@@ le . you can fold and fold the mouse button in a square or push it out . all pictures inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is naturally occurr@@ ing your pictures Ge@@ o@@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit art@@ pall@@ ets and for selecting colors .
the pal@@ ettes files that are stored by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , select from a list of the installed pallet and browse the folder to files .
the c@@ ursor is displayed as line as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it shows the color of it . color is described below the pal@@ ettes view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection , click on the area next to a color to get the c@@ ursor to move . afterwards move the mouse with an pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is inserted into the c@@ ursor under the knob color , the color will be inserted into the c@@ ursor . the color is either inserted or transl@@ ate another ; depending on it , you can set the check box by clicking the check@@ box under the c@@ ursor .
a choice which produces as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cut and inser@@ ts .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shar@@ ehol@@ dings in red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a line @-@ symbols , if there are three numbers of numbers in cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; added .
the colors in the palette and the output of colour cho@@ ices can be pulled with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then you will find in the colour selection on the left .
&amp; graph@@ it ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing on &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in science , especially in the computer science . so far , there were not a modern &amp; GUI ; the programs that are &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the inter@@ viewer ; the project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for looking from &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs are free layout programs . &amp; c@@ graph@@ it ; displays grap@@ ef@@ in with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; and it has the following functions :

additional required software : &amp; k@@ tele@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in an own window . at the beginning , when you open &amp; k@@ topo@@ graph@@ it . in this case the main window will open only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Last modified files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the screen image :
as you can see , displayed an overview in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position from this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right for pressed &amp; alto ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
when the currently being played in &amp; k@@ topo@@ graphic ; loaded file of another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ign@@ ore the change . if you want to ign@@ ore your decision , you can easily change the menu item settings ; please , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ topo@@ graph@@ it , and eg ; in file access or at command line , you will open the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ ha@@ viewer ; install it or want to display the graph@@ it Graph@@ ene in a sub@@ window of the already running inst@@ ances .
as with the last option you can save your choice perman@@ ently but can also change with the setup dialog .
after the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split to several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
when you use multiple sites , you can select whether the parts are displayed on this page . if you are maintained the aspect ratio , the pages may not be completed by the respective parts of the graph .
turned side preview with one onto several sides , without head@@ line and with another font
the page once again has the possibility to specify the behaviour if a file has changed on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ig@@ no@@ red the changes ) or the program each time .
the page opening is possible to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ topo@@ graphy , when a graph opening is opened outside a running session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( using the graph@@ it in a new window or determine that every time it is needed ) .
the seat adjustment gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; tap@@ ing . you can open a default behavior ( the files at the last session or not ) or determine when every start is required .
the context menu , which is usually appears in main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n window ; opens more options :
here you can choose from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ ou@@ tal@@ g@@ ing@@ men . the entries as described in the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorith@@ m , the default for directed graphs . the algorith@@ m puts the edges of directed graphs . the algorith@@ m specif@@ ies the edges in the same direction ( from above or left to right ) and try to produce short edges as soon as possible edge @-@ cutting branches .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ coated grap@@ ef@@ el@@ s. it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . thus , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ w@@ ai @-@ Algorith@@ m is used , which is equivalent to a statist@@ ically important multi@@ dimensional scal@@ ing .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorith@@ m creates a jump @-@ spring model layout . it uses the fru@@ str@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ H@@ EU@@ RI@@ STI@@ K , and contains a multi@@ purpose bracket for the treatment of large and sub@@ clu@@ ster@@ ed graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorith@@ m arran@@ ges the knots circular in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wi@@ ese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cy@@ c@@ lic structures .
open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , which will then run out of a shell . the command should also accept the Graph@@ ite file as parameter , and the calculated layout of graphs by using the graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorith@@ ms are special options , or change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn .

the K@@ IP@@ I module cap@@ tures images are at your disposal to read new images and cut it out .
this module can be used to read new images read by external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
pictures : using the Koo@@ ka Interface to read images from a scanner which supported by the s@@ ane project or another source such as video stre@@ ams . so this will have to have Koo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
if you scan the menu entry images , a dialog appears where you can select between all available sources on your computer . you can also select the source of your image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the Koo@@ ka window appears where you can replace the default values of duc@@ ing your own image , before using the button to select the image . the estimated files@@ ize will be shown to you in the right , lower corner . in the Koo@@ ka Hand@@ book you will find more information .
ensure that the window will be completely displayed , because some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pushed the button scanning , you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to determine the target image appears . here you can also select the Com@@ pression and select the type File . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create a folder by clicking the image .
shots can be generated after you have selected in the menu impor@@ ter &gt; screens . a window appears in which you can adjust the different displays :
choose the complete desktop in order to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will dis@@ appear , so you will be able to read other monitors and windows . in case you will read out the whole work area will only be read out the window under the mouse .
the delay determin@@ es how long screens will wait before it starts . if you have to switch on other work areas , you should make this delay high enough to navigate the time .
once the image has been produced , the dialog options of the target group will appear with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geograph@@ ic local@@ ization allows GPS coordinates to add and to process the met@@ ad@@ ata &apos;s met@@ ad@@ ata . the geograph@@ ic data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ Key@@ word of the image and local@@ ization can be displayed in one external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geograph@@ ic local@@ ization will provide pictures of geograph@@ ically in spher@@ ical coordination system that uses GPS and Galil@@ eo to loc@@ ate . height , column and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ rel@@ ate your pictures with geograph@@ ic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical local@@ ization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ rel@@ ate in the main window and go to the menu . in order to load a possible cor@@ relation to time and local@@ ization , you must load a trace file with G@@ PX file , of course you have recorded data the same time at the same locations , like the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded a automatic cor@@ relation which displays the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore , the camera time is converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . this time you can set up your camera time zone .
setting for the maximum de@@ viation for the maximum time vari@@ ance is an upper de@@ viation for the GPS time and camera time . the de@@ viation of them will be merged . the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for pictures , you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ rel@@ ate all images in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used when you have no matching data . if you know that in reality , you can set this limits in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can cor@@ rel@@ ate to inter@@ pol@@ ating the button .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog box will need to use the button OK to set the data at the current picture .
the local@@ ization can also be found with the displayed card and continue . select the relevant region and enlarge it . the height must be picked up manually , until you can always be selected manually . the card can always be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and one mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to mount the GPS data to the images . here is a small script used to make a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can export the albums released as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be UTF @-@ 8 encoding to make best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be customized . the rider choice allowed it to select to HTML . the albums are not allowed to select one large number of albums . in the area among them , you can quickly choose a large number of albums on the right @-@ hand side and the text which will appear in the head of the HTML page .
the tab appearance defined the general look and layout for each image . this rider is largely created itself . if you click on a picture , this image will be shown on the picture , otherwise the image will be shown directly with your image viewer , and eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed .
the rider record defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved to all your associated images . choose a folder from your desk . a sub@@ folder with the name KI@@ PI@@ HTML@@ export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other colour depth , you can change the standard color depth . the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are self ex@@ plan@@ atory .
the rider models makes you some of the settings from the album tab for the th@@ umb@@ nails , which are small images shown in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user like far the action . press Ab@@ ort to break the process .
when the module created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . this web browser is automatically launched during production . the web browser will automatically display the preview of the gallery . press the module to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows to view a selection of images and perform on them base operations like fil@@ ings , zo@@ oming or shif@@ ting . the viewer can be used with short commands and short@@ est . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without im@@ pair your quality .
this module allows to store pictures in the JPEG format below , without the usual losses of quality or met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequ@@ ence of the los@@ s@@ free storage is that the file size rises since there is no compression of color form@@ ations . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital@@ camera is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ ad@@ ata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ liste k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .org or K@@ IP@@ I Team .
with the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata model , you can copy the data from a picture to another . then select the image select dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image will copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied to the button OK .
this function does not work with any image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer Module is a tool for converting a series of images into a m@@ peg video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to add selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert the pack@@ ets of M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a base picture to the single images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically scal@@ ed automatically for the selected video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the Di@@ asch@@ au . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the media you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au , then you can create the module via the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au module .
the images selected by you are then listed below image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . in case you can select the video format from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify a picture which is displayed in seconds . the speed of the picture process is defined below . a lower value generates very sud@@ den , a high contrast of very smooth ex@@ changes .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and the path of the created file can be found under the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file in the audio source file , then this will be integrated into the film . after you can easily miss the generation of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a cup of coffee and enjoy the di@@ gre@@ y@@ fish if you are back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can custom@@ ize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages on the right below .
the print@@ maker allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper . the combined photos can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is currently useful to improve or print with Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your in RAW format to one of three formats , TIFF , or PP@@ M format .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original itat of Ih@@ m is : expect from d@@ cra@@ b not that it will be the same results as the software from your camera product . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ b better results .
first , select the RAW file that should be converted and start the module . the raw picture @-@ konver@@ ter window appears in the mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the process process , if the first option dec@@ ides to adjust the camera settings as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplif@@ iers . if the result is not optimal , you can process the picture later on .
a four @-@ color RG@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera does not work in RGB mode , the RG@@ BA switch has no effect .
once you are pleased with the preview , you can choose one of the three output file formats and the file name is equal , and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ able algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file size .
the full image format , TIFF , maint@@ ains all information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you might want to process your pictures often or later , you should not use the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality wor@@ sens . TIFF and PP@@ M are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are stored in the RAW file in the EX@@ IF data files .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion . if you want to cancel this process , you can use it off .
the launching domain Mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by test to a single image that are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , you have the possibility of existing file automatically . this is helpful if this is not available in a previous attempt , but the progress indicator shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to compress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a record . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the recordings .
this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it is used to remove the image from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can remove the image or enlarge .
propor@@ tional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen format .
propor@@ tional : not propor@@ tional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust printing resolution and size of phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target size , including background size , edge @-@ size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images before . more pictures can be collected to the list of images .
after compl@@ eting the module , you will add the pictures window with the selected photos . you can add more pictures from you to a file selection dialog . for the recently chosen image , you will see a preview of the right side .
you can also drag the images to the image list and add them to the list of images to be sent .
using the button images , you will remove the selected pictures from the list of the sending pictures .
after you selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add the addresses and the subject to the selected photos .
NOTE that you are not waiting for many pictures at one time . the most e @-@ mail accounts may send con@@ stra@@ int for the size of em@@ ails . it is possible to send a good idea to send many mails if you want to send many images .
the E @-@ Mail window will be used to change the images for sending the images . your configuration will be stored and once again used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the election of comments in a specified file the comments will be joined and added to the text file into a text file .
the PNG format below the File Format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it should be best modified under the los@@ s@@ free formats as such as TIFF . you should therefore not be changed if you want to change the photo quality . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in pictures file format , and the original files in JPEG format will be added , then the original file data will be added to the images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status information , in search of errors , but your email program will be started automatically at the end . the button lets you close this window ? EN .
after the start of the module advanced di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions how to display your slide show . you can select between the selected and all pictures of the album .
option OpenGL runs in the presentation are using very elegant picture inputs via OpenGL . however , you need to own a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slowly .
the filename indicates that the name of the images can be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop will ensure that the presentation in a loop loop will be displayed . you can then break them manually with Es@@ c ;
the option will random@@ ly choose images shown in a random order . so it will not be the order of images in the album .
after delay between the pictures you can set the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds should correspon@@ d to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , it should be out of your computer and the chosen transition effects . so you should be out to show your friends !
there are more than a do@@ zen transition effects between them you can choose . random@@ ly choose between the images and another effect .
while Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool bar at the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you in .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , stop the previous and the next picture and stop the slide .
on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filename , the position of the actual picture and the complete number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool for putting a picture as a background image for the work surface .
this module creates the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the under@@ plane , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can watch with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . like you can see through a comparison with the picture , so in person , places and in group key@@ word entries are available .
in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have entered as you have received information and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look after EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder view on your hard disk and of course the current pattern is described here .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you choose a further person , only the images are shown on which both persons can be shown . by this selection procedure , you can tr@@ yout the number of displayed images from a few thousand images on a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view the images of your area .
in the picture any person has the same symbol in front of her name . however , you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person has its own imag@@ inary image , this also applies to locations , key@@ word and other categories you have defined for yourself . see also the image .
to view images beside the name , select the button , which is on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in this context you can select the view for each category . you can indicate e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of j@@ os@@ words ( if you have no suitable images for your query ) .
however , you need to specify the image for every single person . in order to view this , you will need to adjust the image folder , and in the context menu , you will need to adjust the picture to your wishes . in the illustrated window , you will need to adjust the picture to your wishes , which should be shown and cut off or cut off .
if you are searching for an entry in the main window , you will find a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for the Fest@@ legen the Picture properties . this dialog gives you an image again .
if you wish to enter a string into the field description or description , you can also enter a date when you want , you can also enter a part of the total date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , on which Jes@@ per is shown and not Anne Helene .
this is the user &apos;s guide for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t want to read hand@@ books , but rather try to try functions , you have the following alternative to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick exit to view the screen photos and the entry video .
start &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo album , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start downloading , or start the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; and you can download the images from &amp; c@@ photo@@ album in the menu .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar shows you here : . like the name says , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the time bar can display several different time units . each strip shows you another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by which bar offers only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time line enables you to use the following ways : you can change the displayed entries in the database ( if you select a date ) and the time bar will display the current date of the current pictures , when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select one area of the tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button , so you can select the mouse over the ruler . if you select a range , you will hit the selection by clicking on a bar in the tim@@ eline .
&amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two options available to create HTML web pages with your pictures ; integrated in &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; integrated in &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create on the HTML &apos;s menu ...
before HTML pages , you &apos;ll need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and target .
first , enter the title of the review and a description which is supposed to contain the HTML file later . on c@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example page you see an example of these settings .
next , you choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the index page . ferry information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that the viewer can also be displayed without description . you can &apos;t use all pictures of a party . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain be@@ holder .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look clearly , so the most setup possibilities are clearly , so it is not specifically received .
below on the page you can set different resol@@ utions for the images . this allows you to display your website and display a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no more pictures , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer from your site can change the resolution at any time . it can also change your pictures with low resolution , as well as to a lower speed limit , and if he wants to get a picture larger , it changes too much higher resolution .
in this setup range , place the various folder and the URL where your site is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent kit .
first , you must select the master folder , where all your pictures will be stored . this folder will be stored and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select a folder or a file supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if you &apos;ve created them all for viewing the bas@@ ins . if you have created for the base folder , a web browser will be launched , the URL you should be here . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files are not yet installed in the final destination , you need to manually enter the defin@@ itive goal of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base file in which all sub@@ folders can be found .
the recently described setup possibilities have changed all three to base folders or URLs . in this point , a sub@@ folder is laid out , whose name will establish you in output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the images . if you would like to create a HTML page to look at the images , recording , etc . , you will need to make &amp; stu@@ photo album ; this work doesn &apos;t have to make this work even once .
with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures in a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import and import other images in your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they can be stored whether the pictures itself is stored in the file . the advantage of all pictures can be stored in the file . the obvious draw@@ back is , however , the file size is correct .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or create HTML pages , see , create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures of a des@@ per@@ ate fashion . first , the pictures of the URL , which are shown in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . this is naturally only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file through the HTML format .
the following is described in the following dialog for ex@@ port@@ ing pictures , which you can export via the File Export ... .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is possible to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three cho@@ ices available :
at option Manual , you will copy the images to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy Autom@@ atically near the .@@ k@@ im file copy copied &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically begins for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures already have been compressed using JPEG and don &apos;t want to compress the files . if you want to compress this , just select the Export file to compress .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send your friends pictures , you may not send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big here . here you can tell the size that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file , select &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; ex@@ port@@ ing the exported database as described in .
the assistant for import@@ ing is made up of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import them to import images .
it can be that you think the category persons of the imported file personnel is called ( if you are a d@@ ane ) in this category for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog window which are to be imported to the import file and correspon@@ d to those categories in your database .
in the fourth step , you can delete the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the image .
it must be easy to browse images and watch : if you look at pictures , you would often want to see images within different image groups and see a picture with your friend looking , you might want to see all pictures , on which this friend is shown .
in this manual you will find the steps below ( 1 ) to find the information on your pictures , through ( 2 ) the search and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tion possibilities .
K@@ photo@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . but it was expanded and today it will take care of your videos . in many places this manual is talked about images , but frequently this also includes videos .
&amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; stores all his information in the file in@@ dex@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most file of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CVS , where they want .
&amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this in future start page . if you want to read another folder with images , you can start &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . for example : c@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / images / in@@ dex@@ .x@@ ml .
read about the menu entry settings c@@ photo@@ album ; enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of user manual you will discuss the different settings options .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call setup possibilities and the options for viewing the viewer you can call through a button to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you as you can specify various properties , e.g. individuals , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
on view the dialog box , it is used to work already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a lab@@ eling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set complete assembly groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of an enterprise as stated in .
in view of the list options , you can choose to specify the list of members . in the left window , you can configure the category . in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; share his module system with other graphics applications , such as dig@@ i@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . ferry information can be found on the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called via the modules . the modules can not be described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page which can be access@@ ed via the module itself .
since the modules can be used together with multiple applications , so you can test the modules with the command line ; so you can use new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ lap \ &gt; or via the command Help . don &apos;t tell you , I wouldn &apos;t have war@@ ned you !
the applications which are using K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album are not working . this is the draw@@ back when you share features with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications which can also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported by albums . even if &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order to albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ;
with it sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view@@ point , so all pictures , which shows you the picture preview currently .
next to the current album must be &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s brow@@ sing the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will be used the category , which you have chosen in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums , for example , if you have to use a photo album , so if you have chosen to view the view and give it to the module .
since some modules with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove these from the list of the modules . launch the settings dialog , and select the modules that are loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; start your own image .
as you are familiar with any other K@@ DE application , you will see all of the menu bar and a tool@@ bar . in this section , you will not see the window with which you can &apos;t see your image database , now click on this window , now click on the entry images , which shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with comments on the picture , where the image is recorded or click any remarks or for a larger number of images , if shown on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for search and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box by taking persons , places and key@@ word . these are a very important part of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; because you &apos;re still using it again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is the move to pictures inside the list : if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 images , you can see the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be post@@ pon@@ ed that the persons used to be moved faster and arrange them .
if you prefer an ill@@ iter@@ ate list , click on the icon for sorting after date below the list .
if you have selected remarks for each image , you might want to edit all the selected pictures , and click on the images with notes . please click on the front and back buttons , which are under the picture of the picture on the top .
if you have multiple pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . besides San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ lap . to show you that it is a special symbol displayed .
in the context of context of the feature films it is possible to add one entry to an existing or new or Sub@@ category . additionally , you can also make an entry to a category . attention , this is predic@@ ting that you &apos;ve just sorted your categories alph@@ abe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the feature films by forming the edge of the frames , click and move the upper edge of frames . you can also make an own window by taking it outside of the window .
when you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs , click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to store the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also set out a frame . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and here then a window to f@@ ading . this process can be seen in the image .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will get an overview of the current pictures , or all images in case you have no filter . for example , you can configure the size of the th@@ umb@@ nail when easy to configure the mouse with the middle button . try it easy .
if you place a picture in the background of your desktop , this image will be set as a background picture for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is not displayed in image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images from you and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select the Edit menu . now you will see the window which you can see in the picture .
&amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the photos stored on the hard disk . of course you need to record the images anywhere in the database . in the image , you need to see the image of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , with which the right corner is cut off , are not saved on the hard disk . for example 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pictures are available , so &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; but you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see this function you need to copy files from the folders and want to copy again . if you want to avoid the record of your pictures , so you can avoid any major hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu please click on a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you would like to have a little more privacy , you can also lock the images that you can see for others , you can also control your small sister , you can lock and choose the menu entry .
with this , you have set out what pictures should be hidden in the case of the F@@ alles , just select the menu entry images , allowing all images that you are blocked off . if you want to get out the images again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password to unlock the images to unlock the pictures . to view this password , select your password in the menu Privacy .
please remember that this photo protection is very safe . you can read or delete all images on the hard drive and to the others it can only read out or delete the password . this type of password protection is intended to be released on the file in@@ dex@@ .x@@ ml ; not very familiar , that are with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar , to pass to private images .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; manage and read about hours so you want to look at some time . from this reason it has a picture _ and video viewer . this can be seen from the preview , as described in .
you can see the viewer you can see . it shows the picture , but additional information you can enter over the picture , like who is done on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
in case you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image , you can also configure the mouse and what else you can see . all these options may be displayed on the viewer . all these options may be shown below by a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you are here , the browser , see , matching entries will be shown here . if you &apos;re talking to Anne Helene , the browser features all pictures of Anne Helene . as if you chose Anne Helene and then Anne Helene .
if you have loaded multiple pictures in the viewer you can get back to them and get back , by using the keys image high and the end . you can reach the first and last picture with pos@@ session of Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded into consider@@ ation , you can run this as di@@ asch@@ au . and then you can run a new picture after a few seconds . like frequently it can be controlled by pressing Ctrl key and plus or Min@@ us . start and stopped by pressing Ctrl ; S .
a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; is it in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer simply uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch back in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can use it in the image and extract it out . with the Min@@ us key , you can zoom out again . with the Min@@ us key , you can zoom out back up the image of the image . shows how a Zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is marked and shows the result of ZO@@ OMS .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ om@@ t displayed . using the li@@ ction paste the ZO@@ OMS is so that every pixel corresponding to the screen of a pixel image .
NOTE that the only zo@@ om@@ operations work with videos that are in @-@ fold with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ oust@@ ics .
with the rotary functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this will not work with videos . you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the text menu .
when you can see pictures , you can take a picture of a person whose name you will have to see on the image . in the moment you can open the image and make configuration settings of the picture , but you will perhaps draw the image to mark and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see images on paper . you can start looking at the pictures , while you can select it as well or bad@@ ly , while you watch one after another .
for the two examples above , you will give you the opportunity to watch images with a feature while you see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you can see the corresponding letter . in view , you can see an image where features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you will be able to edit it in your browser . you can also download all pictures you want , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can copy one module to copy the selected images on a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the view view . if you have categories in your view view , then you can add features to the images by clicking the letters for the feature , after the image is selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to paint the photo album ; on the painting .
the painted is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can reverse your old later .
in fact , you can see a picture on the painted side . to finish the painting of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; click on the painting from the text menu . to finish the painting you just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you must have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; do not have fully paid but the documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood .
in the object tree you can choose single objects . then the object features displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wi@@ red screens yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to add a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select menu entry in the menu .
if there are various positions , the following menu will be bl@@ ind@@ ed to choose the right position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene , either from the menu bar , or from the menu bar , or from the menu bar .
if you have any properties changed , click Apply to apply these changes . then you have in@@ valid values will be displayed , and then click on any request or cancel the changes with breaking .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference for the displayed object .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 does the user documentation .
if you edit a tex@@ ture or part of a tex@@ ture , you can preview a preview in the community view .
press preview in the self @-@ shared display and a small example of the scene is associated with the chosen text box , even if you want to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ate item ( for example a tex@@ ture within a tex@@ ture map and not the whole tex@@ ture map ) , cross locally .
the image shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse and change the position and the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for shif@@ ting and turning the position for shif@@ ts . you can change the shift by pul@@ ling with the mouse within the whole window .
each object has a vision model as a wire model . you can only specify this value relative to the vis@@ ibility of objects or as an absolute value . Objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their vis@@ ibility to select the selected vis@@ ibility of the scene .
&amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window rules or if you need a different arrangement , you can save them as desired . you can also change multiple window orders and easily switch between different arran@@ gements .
in order to anch@@ oring a window or under a present view , drag the start to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle shows the new position .
to create a new column , draw the early water or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange several views in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map charts up@@ stairs in the view@@ points .
the last possible window assignment are p@@ age@@ views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring area or click on the small to the left @-@ up arrow in the beginn@@ ings .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the early asser@@ bar . to prevent sli@@ ps , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are p@@ ending you can an@@ cho@@ red at any point .
you can save the current window view ... save the window order ... save a dialog in which you can save the window order under a existing or new name .
when you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g of ren@@ dering this program , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering symbol button in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view .
a R@@ ender mode equivalent to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . he will define the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you are using a scene in different images and quality levels , you may be able to preview many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to full pictures of highest quality .
if you click on the Settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select menu View of R@@ ender modes , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but is mean@@ ing@@ ful but a name that can recognize the characteristics of mode .
in the cardboard box size you can only bear the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to take a small part of the image , select the cross section sub@@ section and give the image detail to the ren@@ dering .
on the drop @-@ down quality you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this is from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use refle@@ ction lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
when a picture is made with only a beam each pixel , there may be different errors . these images have often not displayed a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or incre@@ ment effects in curves and lines , besides that they are sometimes smaller than a pixel . this effect is called al@@ i@@ ases .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technology called anti @-@ al@@ i@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , pictures with this feature is better .
when you turn on Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam ever . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as default , adap@@ tive , non @-@ rec@@ ur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is better split , because each pixel will be divided and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ ur@@ ring depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray automatically proce@@ eds to the default threshold of pixels with super @-@ sampling , then if you adjust the default value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated if you want to add a grid value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the rec@@ ur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . when the difference is shared between the values given the given threshold , then the pixel will be checked in 4 lower pixel and the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion allows you to adjust the depth of the scale .
another way to reduce the al@@ i@@ asing effect is the production of rob@@ ing for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays leads to a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the latest setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use refle@@ ction . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use refle@@ ction flex@@ ion . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map chart you can set if the alpha channels are calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , when the associated beams have no object .
open a new window to display the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly expired , you can find the reason here .
to import one &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray image , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog .
currently , &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler currently supports the complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog for list of messages can be displayed .
if you do not support source code in &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the source text file in the editor to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor , and drag it in the object tree .
with copying and paste in &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is called a scene . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the Help menu , opens &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . place the path to your document and version . it supports versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; Search for external files ( for example difference data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if you enter files , you must also enter the path to these files here . if one file is used in different paths of the library , the first published file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for display the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for display the selected inspection points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the field of view in the camera @-@ view and in the window type labels .
you can adjust the object @-@ cat@@ ching of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model . you can set the grid for shif@@ ts , scal@@ ing and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore a better proximity to the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball can be separately adjustable for two directions .
when you cross large detail st@@ alls for extended projec@@ tions , all wi@@ xt screens are further sub@@ divided , if the camera requires an extended projection . extended projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions for projec@@ tions , but require more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is crossed . the wall will be displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you cross floor , a bottom is placed below the objects . the bottom is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you tick b@@ out of edges , the non @-@ rec@@ ur@@ sive anti@@ al@@ i@@ asing method is used for the Ren@@ dering of scenes . values for depth and threshold value allows you to adjust . accurate data to the parameters in the section of R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window request , it is declared how to create and save window orders .
drop down Standard Window System : displays all of the existing window orders . &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the chosen window assignment in the start of the program .
the list Add existing windows . a new setup allows you to add a new arrangement with the button and removing a selected arrangement with the button .
each window dis@@ order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window assignment . new views can add you to the button and remove selected views of the button .
the new window . with new column , you can create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with file card you receive a flash@@ card view , along with the previous view and the view not in the main window , but also generates a separate window .
so you just have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to start any more specific knowledge of both programs . if you are able to create the ultimate but simple scene , you should very popular among them : a ball on a plane .
but you should consider the following warning carefully before you compl@@ ain about it as a result . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set the camera , you cannot be applied to the Ren@@ dering as a result you will receive a black image .
if you insert no light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will get only a black image .
if you have installed everything wrong , you will see the first start of &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre@@ set con@@ structions are :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object . Mark the scene and then select the menu entry Edit . now you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera is considered the whole scene you can produce . in particular , the view of the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . this is showing you the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the object tree contains a new entry with the name camera . when it click on it , you will find the content of the view characteristics which can be found in the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find out more details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , but this is more instructions to change , but consider the camera in view control points , with which you can change the focus of the camera . simply click on the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired position .
if you press the button 1 or press the button , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately in accordance with these settings . as a result they see here the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a squ@@ ader ( inser@@ ting the f@@ ader ) and the size at x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a de@@ cent method for the solution of this task .
&amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; actually a sim@@ pler way . you can use an infin@@ ite level as the ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view also displays the level as well as at the moment only as limited scale level . if you render the scene , the level extends to the horiz@@ on .
when you are looking to the object tree , you will notice that you will find the default options for each new object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : scal@@ ing , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the ground into exercise under the horiz@@ on line so you can make some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
just choose the ground in order to introduce its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose some different materials at the moment .
in both cases a dialogue will be displayed in which you can select how the object is to be inserted into the object tree . you can preview the name in the property tab . you can preview the name in the property tab . view the pig@@ ment as the pig@@ ment is now looking forward .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material , because you need adjust@@ ing the pig@@ ment of materials at any time with one click on preview . give it a lot of ways to preview the pig@@ ment . but there are also many ways to get the pig@@ lets you get the sim@@ pl@@ est .
when you look no color on qu@@ ader and ball , click the button to apply and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now correct . if you ren@@ dering your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result :
of course , this does not have the color . you need to enter two new attributes . then you can also enter this entry twice ( you can also often do more often but the chess board color list can be used only with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select the colors of any color and change the colors in the view characteristics :
this step should you just be able to perform , because you should have understood the fundamental procedure of &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you should have understood the ball as just as the floor :
in view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . place the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget the ball contact or button tap ) , so that the ball would floating above the ground as you have shif@@ ted the ground around a unit .
of course the ren@@ dering results in now a strange results : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put the following step into a suitable material .
when you have selected the ball , you can as@@ sign a material now . like at the bottom , the ball will give a pig@@ ment as color :
select Re@@ ar Project and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then select button and put the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects when you take time , see some metallic features :
then change the values like in the following screens you click on or press En@@ ter .
the settings of radi@@ ance effect and refle@@ ction shows some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromed surfaces , even if metal tables : even if metal is not selected :
you should now have a good impression of which offers you &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; I hope you already have so much learned that you can create simple , but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you inst@@ alls a scene of ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ dering of the operator ( i.e. from the camera , which are calculated from the perspective ) by any pixels in the scene . the R@@ ender is calculated and how atmosph@@ er@@ ic effects appear like fog as such as fog . so the scene is processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing to see the camera without a camera . without a light source you see also nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , each scene is to be ri@@ di@@ fied , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
open a file . in the Standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have to have created with &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
wh@@ en@@ ever you open a new model , added the file into this menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved this model , it will be saved under the same name . is it a new file , you need to enter a name and storage .
the scene represents the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saving will be rejected .
you can only select this menu entry if you have not yet stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last command . this menu entry allows you to select , if you are using editing .
saves the current window assignment and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for the setting of &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the appearance , the key cuts and the default behavior .
open a dialog for changing the short@@ cuts . you can change this option default commands for &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; change orders or add new commands .
open a dialog for setting up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove these tools by tool@@ kit for &amp; kp@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; -@@ commands and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pair rough surfaces , without any berries on the surface single mod@@ el@@ s. and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump card as well as a tex@@ ture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ zens of these plots . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a tex@@ ture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour to pixel base , by applying a image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ch@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and brow@@ sers . the application features a file access where you can select images for display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in size or full@@ screen @-@ mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ch@@ show ; is very simple . the file number lists files that you can click with &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
you can set if any picture is displayed in your own window , or if all images should always be the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , type the first signs of the filename in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right lower corner . if a matching file name was found , you may leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in dialog set @-@ up - &amp; ku@@ ch@@ show ; there are five card types . in three of these , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working methods of &amp; ku@@ ch@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to set the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , the default is no full screen mode .

the other settings contains more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) do not cover these options .
in order to arrange an image , the user can only start a starter and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the presentation can be started by the preview button .
to select the image , the user can also zoom in the image and zoom out in the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom as well that fits the complete preview in the window .
when the picture was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview can be selected in the settings , then the image will be shown below , shown below , when saving is saved , the image will be saved and lie back into the main window .
by button settings the same named dialog is open before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option simply must display a preview . if this preview is not desired , the option has to be chosen .
this setting allows you to select the kind as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; store a dialog for each image opening a dialog . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite will store this automatically with a generic name in a previously defined folder , you need to save , without any file name .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs key , you can set up a list of this symbol and its function . choose the right mouse button in the player window , click with the right button of key into the player window by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select a short command ... select .
you may also install existing multimedia buttons so that it works as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short command works . thus make up your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , text browser , playlist , playlist , playlist for D@@ CO@@ P function rec@@ ess &amp; z@@ b ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports command @-@ line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; but Amar@@ ok an own command @-@ line options added .
you should specify a feedback if the script may not be executed because of a lack of depend@@ ency . please check in your script if all needed modules are connected , so that the user is not running , why a script is not running .
Beg@@ in @-@ &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos;s Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding posts for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding posts v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
in the folder scripts / templates you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages . they can easily fix them as a base for your own scripts . they will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the eas@@ iest way is to use command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be bending after each K@@ DE installation .
most scripts would enable the execute external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec function is usually called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simply called . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sent mess@@ aging to all the running scripts . for this reason , sc@@ rip@@ pled its standard input and respon@@ d to events . of course , sc@@ rip@@ es should also ign@@ ore the events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store and loading the setup data you must take care of every script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok goes on the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change signals that a new piece is displayed . the script can now drop &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or play length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ al@@ izes a change of volume . the new volume is an inte@@ ger value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title : contains the path to the selected files of playlist , if a custom menu entry can also be used to remove the script used to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ails ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if the user stop a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal for SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to do the use of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok Script administration can also install script packages that you can download the user and z@@ b ; such packages have been compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be able to recognize the archive using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can clearly recognize the archive using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the increase of amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right right .
the main script should be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining capacity of the modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file status :
if your script package is ready , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org to susp@@ end and use the link to the W@@ iki Sk@@ etch page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .

with the choice of custom colour scheme , you even have the tor@@ ment of choice and can determine their own color scheme . use it among them activated color selection for front and background color .
playback will continue playing , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start playing , the playback has been attached to the place , with which she was stopped during the last moving .
the on @-@ screen display using on @-@ screen display allows you to preview the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , you will see a preview of the O@@ SD and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click to select ... to select the desired font for O@@ SD . the cross @-@ down shadow effect that the text in the O@@ SD is sh@@ aded .
own colors use the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on colour selection . if own colors are not activated , the pre@@ set &amp; k@@ de colors are used .
the input field display text display the displayed in the O@@ SD character . by adding foot@@ boards the O@@ SD can be adjusted to its own needs . below you find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option is intended for X@@ ir@@ ama users . this enables you to specify the screen of a multi @-@ user monitor environment that will appear to the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection panel . some drivers activate a further adjustment possibilities in this card box .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , browse &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for introduc@@ ing the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folder : this works that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the cros@@ ses and their sub @-@ folders after music .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screens .
Amar@@ ok only uses the k@@ del@@ ib@@ s package and don &apos;t have any other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ del@@ ib@@ s installed . you need some of them to find out e.g. Module or scripts . we have written a small guide , how to minim@@ ize c@@ del@@ ib@@ s minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD is pre@@ di@@ ct that your window manager will run the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ ast@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will run for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ del@@ ib@@ s and Q@@ t , because these make an excellent development environment .
probably , you can perform one of your files in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can perform the file to run in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log you can also send the broken file to the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most import@@ antly , it &apos;s important that di@@ lib at the reading of the Met@@ a information from this file system crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something sufficient .
make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b , but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when editing the Met@@ a Information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then turn off the machine when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the trace trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open to a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurr@@ ing crash , the bug is guaranteed to us .
this is done to write many program data as UTF @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a @-@ Info , but this is not known as Unicode . the following Perl script promp@@ ts the problem .

this script uses the Perl module to MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Symbols in the status bar ( random mode ) see always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbo@@ lic changes can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click on the control centre at App@@ ear@@ ance symbols . NOTE that in some cases , you can click on a symbol for up to three times , until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : symbol look@@ up error : icon @-@ up : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed with L@@ DD &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you might need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf that Amar@@ ok the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems with the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also search for other users or for developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear only one error , if you have a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist . how come there come to pieces now ?
it &apos;s easy . use the file access to the left and open the desired folder . then draw the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ itiv@@ ely , the start window was converted into the statistic windows . you will find below extras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to rate the evaluation list , the evaluation list must be displayed . click on the title bar list and select column display . click here to set the review for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist to your menu .
drag the playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let it fall there , exactly like you would do it with other files . so easy is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to add @-@ button , the button will be back to the playlist . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel program and install Amar@@ ok ; new . also look after lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ al@@ izations .
the equ@@ alizer is in a context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it via the menu bar under the Extras equ@@ alizer ....
no . Yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question is supporting G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can &apos;t support any imag@@ in@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can be ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will be no MP3 Decoder ( made for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Play@@ ing MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the Al@@ sa sink to set the device with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must be set to use the device for the same time and to play the same time as audio card ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software @-@ Mixer ) .
this command should help you in search of the problem and help a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you might have to specify a different s@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded first to AL@@ SA . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you read a decoder with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , exactly like x@@ ins .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the sound server with highest priority ( real time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ e@@ rap@@ per su@@ icide is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause un@@ distur@@ b playback . read this bug @-@ bug in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc can also help .
either use not use the host driver but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ins , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia complete to get the faster video code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ge _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the driver driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optim@@ ised for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . each smaller of the buffer , the less jobs respon@@ d to the visu@@ al@@ izations . Yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I like to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , turn off &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . register GST regist@@ ers to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok , before ! ) : - Download the FF@@ m@@ peg file , comp@@ ile and install it on the module folder from G@@ Stre@@ amer all FF@@ m@@ peg files ( you can find the module folder with GST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run GST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report on bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . if you have a whole list of proposals / wishes , please send it best to our ma@@ iling list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . Set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing , make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music , which you are going to bed before bed@@ time .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running this title , if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a function@@ ing SSH environment is available , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you Inter@@ pre@@ t and title of current item from : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RS@@ A ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user @-@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your user@@ name . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RS@@ A is present .
the visu@@ al@@ izations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changed window .
the combination of Ctrl + right mouse button provides one piece in the cli@@ ffs sequence . by p@@ ushing the mouse button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and reset .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look inside the Control Panel icon ?
click OK &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; you can select the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser should be displayed .
my Personal License $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can &apos;t be created and on the console offers many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it will not work with NFS . you must either link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ Ks MySQL support .
place the CD , then click on the menu on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . in the wav file , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired target folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , you get files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

shows information about the pic@@ kled media . this information is displayed in the table view and include features of the media , such as size and titles length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed off , a small strip is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is out .
switches the folder view or out . the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents are enabled , the contents will also contain a text menu with functions such as Media @-@ Info , lock and unlock the media .
turns the contents on or out . the table view allows selecting and pul@@ ling files into the project view . the other view is also selected to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD folder .
turn off the head spot in the project view , or out . the head spot is a small area that is only visible when the project view has open projects . the cou@@ p@@ iste has no real function , it looks pretty pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views .
this will open a dialog window to change the key orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the button assignment below .
this will start installing the K@@ 3@@ b ; so you can set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the system administrator at the launch of the assistant ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can work general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work correctly . this dialog is intended for Personal@@ ize and re@@ adjust@@ ing the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; is also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you can use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p , or something more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , so that &apos;s more your taste and the type of your task is decisive , which can give you the back programs .
in this chapter , we ass@@ ume that you can use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p . you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
apart from the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de program are supported , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD , and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video @-@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Video _ ) void form@@ at@@ D@@ vd ( ) void form@@ at@@ D@@ vd ( ) void form@@ at@@ D@@ vd ( ) void bur@@ n@@ c@@ vd@@ Image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ vd@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method , one receives a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then an reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the up to K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void add@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and will then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der du@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / mar@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; and can be saved to &amp; k@@ de ; with it , you can easily read audio CD ; also read and can be saved in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( un@@ borne de@@ compression ) . further coding can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first , the title of &amp; CD will be read and stored in WAV files on your computer ( los@@ s@@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per share ) will compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the read out of &amp; CD ; , is compiled by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled pack@@ et ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) must be installed ( for MP3 ) , Og@@ g@@ Vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ dings . all these programs are not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it &apos;s not necessary to compens@@ ate anything itself . if for example FLA@@ C is not necessary , it is also not necessary .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; even if not the firmware of the audio CD ; / DVD unit is not provided for any copying system ; even if not the mechan@@ isms of copying protection does not be possible to avoid the mechan@@ isms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while saving installation only has to be performed ( the setup dialog can be found as often as often as a suitable configuration ) , it will be explained to the drive for the slim approach of the interface , which will be christ@@ ened in the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which co@@ ax programs installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from Free@@ D@@ b from the internet or work fully without network , where everything is written manually .
this is only a short list of the principal commands . on this page , for example , you will find further information how this program uses as well as screens with descriptions of the programme tab .
the CD@@ DB will start the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD data according to the device from request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online in the latter case first to use the connection to the Internet . )
the program will start reading and - if an encoder in the register diagram editor has been configured in an entry system - the coding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder which can be read out using a different encoder as the default . it is possible to note that previously the encoder in the tab dialog is configured in the setup dialog .
opens the File Manager , so that a already selected file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog for the type of messages ( such as protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
open the main control dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with various maps ( such as encoder , to set the En@@ coders ) . go out before the program can be successfully deployed !
this chapter covers audio quality , body and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right body code .
if no audio files are to be lost , a los@@ s@@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be used for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small compression rati@@ os and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information via data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG files are the most frequent bit@@ rate for lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 kbps ) , but more than this bit@@ rate are less important , because both Ko@@ di@@ ers will produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is provided with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ High up to very high quality quality ( with high bit rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality for de@@ eper bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing og@@ g players is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - support these devices mostly support the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most mus@@ ic@@ iles acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kbps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kbps C@@ BR , compression rate 5.5 . needs always 256 kbps for complex and fewer complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kbps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11th 128 kbps for all pieces of young people , portable devices and auto@@ ster@@ e@@ o@@ ids . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kbps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely have the absolutely highest quality without consider@@ ation to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that manually enter or through the program will be collected from Free@@ D@@ b via the internet , are available in the program available as a list of parameters . you can transfer / needed to create the folder and file name as well as the code of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the body and these parameters . the manual or the help to the code readers explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; Title to the j@@ ail@@ words ( English : day ) to add MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame must be added to l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button of a button in assist@@ ants ) :
it is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database to read and enter the information you can enter into the computer , so that all other of the information can be downloaded from ones@@ elf in the calcul@@ ator . it is written here only by text ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
Yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. of the book ) am not att@@ or@@ ney . however , no one can prevent the public on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so the artist may not be added directly to the music business . all information can also be used with a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active to select a cross@@ field ( sending a address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems to be used with another ( f@@ ake ) address of the retri@@ eval of the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
in many countries the main database are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator is used , the geograph@@ ically below mirror server is to use . this saves bandwidth on the network and res@@ em@@ bles the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org offers a current list of refle@@ ctions on the online call for &amp; CD ; information during read out a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that it doesn &apos;t want to know , search in the source code .... It was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first from the right distribution first , if this is not yet done .
to save the saved WAV files , the co@@ di@@ erer and thus select the desired file format will be selected . during the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio files ) on the setup card can be added to the register map itself .
the co@@ ater package must be installed by the Linux distribution which can be used before the code can be used . further information on Ko@@ di@@ erer is also displayed in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , you can obtain further information on its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . the name must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
that can have many causes . to check out the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read @-@ code your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not be successful !
there is a chapter with a step by step for example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood anyway ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for example , and you will get enough information to configure those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable Bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and I@@ D3@@ v@@ 1 sample words ( tags ) .
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can always do .
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to it ( eg ; by trying to copy some inside ) .
the first section covers basic incl@@ usion of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each registration &amp; CD ;
here , we determine the possibility of using music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kbps ) and what structure is used to use the program running Free@@ D@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings , we will probably not change them at any output of a &amp; CD ; change when the matching settings are found .
the specifications name will pass on the program program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbo@@ lic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working , even if more than a &amp; CD drive can be provided , the effective specifications of your drive can also be attached to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to handle the device &apos;s existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map General Settings . there &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be as busy / em@@ bo@@ ated as illustrated in the screens .
for in@@ complete information please consult , so you will be informed if data are missing from keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b computer .
NOTE : the computer must be connected to the read of the &amp; CD ; connect to the Internet to access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second selection process is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found right when you can easily change the directory name / filen@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily change easily . the directory or name will be easily modified and the ID3 tags can be changed with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , you will need to be able to check if you want to enter the drop @-@ down mode if you want to use the database before . however , this must be worth@@ while using Free@@ D@@ b in the offline mode , the two cho@@ ices must be selected , at least the first mode has to be set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is Free@@ D@@ b for us . these are settings for the data on request , for call from the Free@@ D@@ b server about the Internet . as white the system that data is to get the CD ? read the section via Free@@ D@@ b . see everything as shown in the screen image .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , but we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page Fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look into a mirror server nearby . on this road the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting can work as the first attempt .
both work even equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls will bo@@ iling the protocol 88@@ 80 as standard , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to Free@@ D@@ b Server . the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp on your PC exists )
Number of simultaneously permissible pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one of the existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and en@@ code ? the author does not make it yourself .
CD ; following the read out of the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; cast out at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you want to cross this , then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored in which the WAV files can &apos;t be enabled , if you don &apos;t want to make the files in the private folder , if you don &apos;t want to make this folder some files with WAV files .
everything that is just as it is on the screenshot . the command is something long , under circumstances , something that may be bl@@ ind@@ ed to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . like previously mentioned , the resulting bit rate is sufficient for very good HiFi stereo plants . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 and 256 kp@@ bs . the resulting compression is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
NOTE the record &quot; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restri@@ ction of the Tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; I@@ D3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the input @-@ file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this ex@@ emp@@ le :
Number of simultaneously to en@@ code WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we have just completed the basic configuration of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as default for each ad of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music you never need to change it again .
in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder can be set up and set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ D@@ b is to be set up and has to be repeated for each registration &amp; CD .
since we have a &amp; CD ; do not use the image files in Free@@ D@@ b , see the screen shots a bit different from the same for one &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; so you will manually get the files to pick it up from the Internet .
don &apos;t try to find the exact copy of this script . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD player has to be defined in the main window , in the main window .
after a brief moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen image . this only if the &amp; CD ; identified as audio CD ; identif@@ ies and can be read from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then check the following Questions and Ans@@ wers after the Help or go back to the previous section .
attention : when the &amp; CD ; successful from Free@@ D@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the title of the artist and the albums are shown .
for the case , there will be more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there &apos;s a window t@@ ends , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion fits to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not have the check box for automatic shut down from Free@@ D@@ b ( on the side &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually configure the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not need local database , but need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - entering CD data and the title of the first piece
insert the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen image , enter the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; actuator title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a comp@@ ilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower commentary field can be used for single comments in@@ valid@@ ated per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments , together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of data from Free@@ D@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to test the contents of the CD @-@ editor ( e.g. if all words with big letters start or not ... ) , but also to ver@@ ify whether there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
NOTE : in this example , we only use I@@ D3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album , and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you are limited to the video tab , you will have a look at the tab of Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ Settings ; have a look inside the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files later , with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create I@@ D3@@ v2 Tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ aches or file formats . see the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
simply select an entry which is obviously un@@ tun@@ ed with the style of the sent CD ; for example , this is not important as we read the &amp; CD ; and read the information on fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are available at Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor appears and you will see that the fields for the album is already filled with the given data , which we recommend for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current form . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way up to you all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from Free@@ D@@ b . it is sorted in one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . notice that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
NOTE that it has a check @-@ in prior to each line of a piece . only the titles be selected so marked out . a simple click on the screen will choose the selection of all pieces directly at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selecting the read process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then will we take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going .
click the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is placed in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the program &apos;s status will be displayed in the lower left section of the window .
this error message allows you to work with a co@@ ater you have not installed . pieces which have not been successfully en@@ coded , with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target audience are not what we &apos;ve got here in the example . do you checked if you have a write access to the temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished , but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and code in parallel . notice the status indicator in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to press this behaviour . the only one that seems to read and en@@ code . for high @-@ weak machines , the result is un@@ clear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem in simultaneous read and co@@ d ( of course two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is coded and a third order is en@@ coded , after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message is inserted in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . and 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you will need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; however , if you get to CVS as part of the k@@ dem@@ ulti@@ media package . if you are already familiar with CVS , you can get a pre @-@ compiled copy of your distribution . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is directed to people who comp@@ ile the source files , and not intended for users who use the pre@@ compiled pack@@ et of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program you meet your needs if it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program running many different other programs , has many variants of settings . the best read the step for step example to know the options and settings . it shows screenshot of the various maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still click on read yet ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked with any starting point as it is going on from this somewhat empty screen ( above all , if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably the program has already started . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately not an e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and who will always be something us@@ ef@@ ul@@ ding or change it . at least , if you read this , it has also agreed to this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal .

you can also find a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , window to the &amp; k@@ mid window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and keep the button Ab@@ ort in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu piece or put the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played afterwards . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece playing , you can jump to any spot by using the middle button and drive on the knob and drive on .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can change the arrows to the left and on the right hand speed . to get the speed of the speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , causes a pressure on the space bar , or selecting the menu button in the menu . thus breaking the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; Play@@ ing .
lyrics can be saved on two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ rif@@ i , others use Lie@@ dt@@ external event and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up which events should be shown and even better : the er@@ ection type is automatically det@@ ects that you have been selected manually , so you will be able to change your kar@@ aoke text automatically , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to adjust a er@@ ection type , select from the menu adjust@@ ments the entries Tex@@ ter@@ restri@@ ctions and song ideas . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are listed in the series . in this section , how you can easily manage collections .
to create a collection , open the collection manager . click here to organ@@ ise the collection below the point .... Click New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the required hab@@ its in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to no other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . concerns this if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the button . it appears in turn to the file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on adjustment Autom@@ atically adding to the collection .
if automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( when using file or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically add a collection to the collection , a piece of the temporary collection will be activated and upgraded to this collection . the collection will continue to be upgraded .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to select the collection manager , select the collection and then click on .
you can select the order in which the songs are played , if you select the series from the menu down menu of the menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be defined .
to play a song , choose it in the collection manager , or use the selection above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump on a song , select the button Next song , next song from the menu or press the button arrow on the right .
to sk@@ ip a song back to the reverse , select the button &apos;s previous piece , the entry is a previous piece from the menu or press the key arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , they don &apos;t play as they are stored by &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events will be used in events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ Map which converts any events of the Type Change patch to Bright Piano in Events of the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , which was always a trumpet , if originally a piano one should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are compatible ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps . thus , you need to edit the corresponding file of your hand ( with your favorite d@@ itor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that saves all required settings for playback of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may often appear as desired . but it is , that every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that it is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , the patches are shown as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the mark is ig@@ no@@ red . it is assumed that GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and do not leave the order for any of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to take all sounds that use this instrument with the number M . if your keyboard are not supported for example ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . this includes the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI @-@ file is playing a note with patch 127 ( rif@@ le ) , it accepts patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that the term drum patch is meant to be with that of any sound , another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not that of the sound the sound of the same drum means ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section is the order of rows very important , as well as presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form notes on the per@@ cus@@ p channel . see example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you wish to destroy the first and second channel , you simply do it at CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the per@@ cus@@ sion on a certain channel ( General MIDI channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following specimen :
N is the channel , which is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be used for this channel . if you &apos;re using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ig@@ no@@ red to change the patch on that channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion @-@ channel .
the value for pitch ratio can be multip@@ lied in which ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender will be multip@@ lied with the value n , this is converted to the formula 1 * ( r / 4096 ) , and then it is used until the map file is not used , thus , in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al@@ com@@ ism .
this setting is needed , because GM indicates that a pitch , that &apos;s a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event will be played with the value 4096 , one tone above . unfortunately , but try some key@@ boards up to one oc@@ t@@ ave to play on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row of Kla@@ is ( one for each MIDI channel ) . see these act@@ atures , which sounds just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have a tool to change , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played sounds . see the menu Settings under the Point channel view : settings
the pace LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the larger the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the pace , use the arrows turn left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it , like a music piece has to be played , so it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices into very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can not use any@@ body , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file requires app . 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file requires a similar sound quality . during a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed and etc , you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; have this happened , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support you need to download and install the re@@ distribution ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no pleasure to add all files .
do agree , this is supporting &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in previous step , you will be able to add automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to temporary collection .
you can make the arrow button from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard tem@@ po you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way I have to play if the collection is playing at the end or I want to play a file , or change the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; move the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen quickly a file , without them directly add to a collection , turn off automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to temporary collection .
supp@@ ose you have the MIDI Files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . and first do you want to play the first file . so , adjust the adjustment Autom@@ atically adding to the collection and then put it on this a MIDI @-@ file .
then do you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you make it ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you so much ! if I see these songs or see the postcard , animated me that on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m not much free time at the University of Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; but I try to take a bit of time for my ho@@ bb@@ ies . when ho@@ bb@@ ies I have program to collect MIDI files , music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files you can also download one error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me huge pleasant anticip@@ ation , if you send me a postcard from your place or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a MIDI file , but if you want to receive a MIDI file , you should get in contact with me , as I might have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and judge no one in my spare time . I therefore want to make mention of it because when I get back messages from users ( Post@@ cards or E @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the error , that the pitch for A@@ WE @-@ cards was too high .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the test of the G@@ US support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bie@@ ker , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Marc Die@@ the@@ ider , Ulrich Cor@@ des and everyone , who sent me a patch , an error not@@ ifications or also only a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail sent .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these brilliant musicians in the net , which give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its website , which is found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html is . on the homepage you can see the development and look at links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you to use a sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality is much easier . it &apos;s not the same if you use FM radio or an A@@ WE @-@ card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card you have to compens@@ ate &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ IS@@ UAL , then if you have any sound card , except you can hear no music .
if problems occur , just contact the &amp; k@@ de ; email or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for m@@ Player , phon@@ o and FF@@ m@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files from the M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ ie ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer .
for additional help please check the K@@ DE site on new releases , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user ma@@ iling list .
the application window is formed from the so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ tically windows . there &apos;s always the window with the playlist . and finally there is a window window that will only display when information is stored .
it is possible to drop the preferred connections under the book@@ marks , but this is individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category continuous playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ arch@@ ical stage . if you click an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied into the current category and play with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only select the files in directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category . by clicking on a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to be chosen from the menu and select either the processing mode or selected one other category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
following the conven@@ ience of the author &apos;s &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation of running and loading can be disabled by editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; if the option is not available , it can be simply added .
it is also possible to activate other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at Start does not need to be short , but it will be replaced automatically by opening a different source . this would be distur@@ bed by the end @-@ animation , the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be your favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; Hol@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ defin@@ ite &quot; src = &quot; file : / / / home / Koo@@ s / m@@ um@@ .g@@ if ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / if some examples of S@@ MIL formats are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing the M@@ Player Con@@ figuration dialog from &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here the edition of m@@ player is evi@@ dent .
there is no rider for this tasks in the configuration dialog from &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual loading of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , such as the setup of the back@@ end per m@@ im@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be used to valid@@ ate the specific field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in playlist .
to return the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages must play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ Type , / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the alignment dialog file of the K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; comes in a console application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser window library . if there is no mistake , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the text menu ) .
with this always a default port for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c ) , for example , phon@@ on must play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play by TV cards , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . you need to use the use device and the TV channels . to this , the scanner can be used manually and edit the configuration file .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video is to be found out of which one is selected . the correct name must probably include a DVB to it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video , it should work as well ( probably this type of recording of video equipment under Linux is the only one works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ linux extension has to be function@@ ing for the X server must therefore be in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
intern@@ ally are used by S@@ ME for the sources different names . at the time of creating this documentation is this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ec@@ li@@ pse , pip@@ ing , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start with the playback of the playlist .
are there references to do so I do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not from the VCD name : / / ) ?
Yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to result as user root after joining the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine is only slowly getting up , why does my CPU become checked to their performance every time ?
NOTE : the answer is over@@ hol@@ t . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs to check the last stored value , only the first time will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ;
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . on Unix @-@ like systems , it is probably based on the package &amp; texts live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; GNU distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some comp@@ il@@ ated packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these make an easy installation without further comp@@ ile and are included on the k@@ ile ; -@@ Website .
this manual is for everyone - independently of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggest@@ ions for documentation is considered . the support for this project or documentation should be made , should be made contact over the k@@ ile ; -@@ Website .
Ask question or when comp@@ iling &amp; acquis@@ itions ; or are desired extensions , this should be addressed on the ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; setting for the &amp; k@@ de ; the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphic surface and within this one simple , immediate and custom@@ iz@@ able access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; provides easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its ways you can learn the manual for Kate &apos;s . users from &amp; k@@ ile ; can start with reading the Chap@@ els Editor , by &amp; Kate .

here only a good start to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given here , it is not the ultimate book . about &amp; lat@@ ex ; you should maintain good b@@ ills , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W.

just as the other version of recording includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to be set up as well as a text format , page description and text size . the introduction starts with the command \ \ documentation { document } and must be made with the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class , and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ entry assistant conductor &amp; k@@ ile ; is a n@@ Ã ¼ st function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the document ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some evidence for the creation of the document . there are also some evidence of the document generated .
document classes : this is the way to document the document : articles ( article ) , book &#91; L@@ etter &#93; , report &#91; L@@ etter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ in@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ utable &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .

this list , the most commonly used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration , they merely require only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t wor@@ ry about wor@@ ry . this is only a short description of the functions and further information of the information will be presented in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; however , it is as such as other source code @-@ ed@@ itors - the her@@ ence of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) is noticed by the mod@@ est appearance of the output . however , it is notice@@ able by the mod@@ est aspect of output file . however , it saves you by the emphasis on time and shut@@ down .
with the automatic de@@ bur@@ sement of environments , for input of a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically set up an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this feature can be disabled in volume settings ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into few elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encour@@ age the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the longest and sub@@ and the lowest element ) :
in view of the document , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective point .
when creating its own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; od@@ d file &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the central mouse button in DVI ; viewer for the corresponding line in the lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; -@@ Data reve@@ als a description of the format document and other information as the font and is besides PDF the size of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , converting and to convert DVI ; files for different systems and dishes .
when using the running surface , the elements of DVI ; -@@ File is cli@@ cked on a element in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked on the contrary section . once upon a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , will be cli@@ cked on the respective point in DVI ; -@@ viewing .
Master document : this function is used for work with multiple files . with a Master document , the work with other incl@@ .@@ tex files is simplified . if using a project , a project master document can be set to project settings .
quick@@ set : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled automatically and the result will be displayed automatically ( unless a bug in the source code ) .
file storage : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file on the remote log will be called the date and there is no call from &amp; eye@@ piece ; after the free@@ way .
in consider@@ ation of editing the tool bar , the three gro@@ und@@ r@@ s must be found for the quick setup of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The rec@@ al@@ right &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection panel More is for use of articles such as keywords , foot@@ notes , or reference . the necessary measures are :
name : with this command , a name is designed for a section , a picture or different element .
regarding : is used for a reference to a specified number ( selection for a selection panel ) .
when using quote , a selection of liter@@ ary entries is displayed . at &amp; Bib@@ Te@@ X ; this only works if the file is going to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; kb@@ ib@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; Bib@@ Te@@ X ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection panel with the name of the name is used for the laying of the font name . it can be set for the main text , the foot notes , etc. are defined : there are the following font description for placement :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two selection options for creating a new document by selecting the document type and the legend of the document . 2 . the document can be written by reason .
the cl@@ amps according to the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class include the settings for the command . the font is fixed . the font is not to start at the beginning , can this also be done in the text .
once the above source code has to be entered , the lat@@ ex must be compiled into source code . the eas@@ iest way to this is the use of the building of building or at the push of a button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the recording automatically .
the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be chosen according to the errors . when using quick removal , eye@@ piece should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be respec@@ ted .
an environment ( in English ) is a text that is different from the resi@@ dual document . is , for example , a report with the font name is provided . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ &apos; and \ \ end { environment } , \ \ , and \ \ end { cultivated } , \ \ , and \ \ end { environment }
in the area ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } up \ \ end { environment } . there is no liability ( number ) for the dis@@ abilities within a environment .
there are many possibilities to provide the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . there are certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive printing , under@@ lines , etc . it will end up either with the command \ \ , or automatically the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the solid pressure and is long as G@@ Ã ¼ st , until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be depic@@ ted using \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ s : creates a quote from document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ s } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ ity } .
after writing of the source in writing with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; recording language , a step @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile follows ; .
once assistant was entered a bit text , some adap@@ t@@ ances for the better read@@ ability of the document must be accomplished . a quote , some places in fat and cur@@ sive printing and a po@@ em to be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor , or Ctrl @-@ E editor . for an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and sp@@ a@@ ible .
DVI ; is a large file format ( with D e V ice I now@@ here ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some in the computer . there are many different types of .@@ dv@@ i output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ sions or computer screen TV@@ s .
for printing a &amp; DVI , the same steps as possible for creating the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can print out the document by file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar encour@@ ages the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI , file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , you can start converting in desired other formats using the kne@@ es in the tool@@ bar .
you would like to encour@@ age the direct jump from the editor to da@@ p in the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries to be setup . only Modern under the settings can be set up ... Tools will be balanced .
in order to make the fore@@ hand search , the mouse po@@ inter must be cli@@ cked on a line of the source in a line . the jump to the respective point in DVI ; -@@ viewer will be done .
with this function in &amp; eye@@ piece ; one click on a button of the medium @-@ button in DVI ; -@@ document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; and for this purpose , &amp; quot ; in &amp; eye@@ piece ; as a text editor are set ( settings E@@ ye@@ piece setup ... editor )
if using quick removal of the &amp; DVI spl@@ itter , you cannot imagine a bug , if a bug has to be submitted , this will be shown in the recording file respectively into the News window .
the file log@@ ging file contains the error source in source . in the editor , the Kn@@ auf La@@ Te@@ X @-@ Er@@ ror and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X @-@ Er@@ ror shall be used for spra@@ ying problems . to view the faul@@ ty line , must be cli@@ cked on the error in recording and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to incor@@ rec@@ t line .
once on the respective button is cli@@ cked on the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template for the document . pre@@ set fix@@ tures are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can be written either from the ground or the assistant to create a new document . further information can be included in the section .
powerful user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; stored and loaded to make the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you have to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; or create a new template , create a new template of an existing document and create a new template from document . create a new template .
when creating a new document from a template by file , some string sets replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... settings General are set .
when creating the template , it is necessary to know which string chains of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SOP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SOP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and thus the use of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way the following steps was executed :
when creating a new document , you can create your own template instead of default in the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . a simple way to create a template should be sought after one in the internet and the steps above described above .
&amp; quot ; used &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers and her@@ ence of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bib@@ Te@@ X ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his mist@@ akes you should learn the manual for Kate &apos;s . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start with the reading of Chap@@ els by the Editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command @-@ reference , which can be called for the quantity help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you may be able to find a suitable description for almost all commands that can find in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with pressed Str@@ g button to compens@@ ate the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on the \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ sk@@ ip only \ \ par rounds orders .
when drawing the text with the left mouse button , the balanced text will be copied automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with the pushed button , can be balanced to the source code in the ed@@ itor@@ box .
&amp; k@@ ile ; you can browse the different types of sources of sources and produce them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathem@@ ati@@ cal form@@ ulas are emphas@@ ized by another color .
many wiz@@ ards can be found in the text . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ Ã ¼ r@@ zel encour@@ age the jump to the most or last diving mark . this jumps is also high@@ ligh@@ ted , so that it is automatically activated by the first input of a draw .
the working is probably one of the main asp@@ ir@@ ation during the use of a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; Kate ; already excellent cap@@ abilities have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; most important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; provide special commands for their selection . under construction are the following commands are included :
orders a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which contains on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning is not a text with all text codes , thus tables and all other lines of the source text . the only one @-@ be@@ ading thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the waste is separated by two empty lines .
orders the word in the current C@@ ursor position . this command also has an extended meaning as this command also commands &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands covered with a repeat factory ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) command .
for the building of a part of the document can be removed from this first , it will be removed by pressing the button Ctrl ; K with which the whole line will be removed . &amp; quot ; with his own commands , the following commands are provided for the text of the text :
a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description for working statements .
it has already been suggest@@ s that environments a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; play . therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under the surrounding area , for a good easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , in the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the command to the outside .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to fly the surroundings .
if the c@@ ursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , the end of the environment will be trig@@ gered ( or vice versa ) .
during the input of many committed environment commands , this command can be lost quickly . this command is har@@ der and the last environment will not dis@@ pers@@ ed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under the Te@@ X Group , some important commands are to match those of those work environment .
this command is used for the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the bo@@ red clamp .
with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the sh@@ ro@@ unding clamp .
when the c@@ ursor is before or behind the h@@ ired fl@@ ammer of a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group is in@@ jected to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many sc@@ iss@@ ed groups sc@@ iss@@ es may be lost quickly the back@@ side view . this command is har@@ der and the last group structure , so that the restored structure of the &amp; tex ; groups not dis@@ pers@@ ed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple signs of execution is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for the purpose of the instructions shall be used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and is sufficient for two shif@@ ting signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automated inser@@ tion signs can be set @-@ up under the settings for Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and follow @-@ up .
there can also be used specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and therefore Germans or French . there are also many other languages available .
when the Shift From Shift ; En@@ ter aste &amp; k@@ ile ; there is an intelligent line @-@ around . if the current position is located within a list of lists ( such as en@@ umer@@ ates or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for &amp; k@@ ile ; not only a row , but also the command \ \ item .
within a tables of tables &amp; ro@@ pes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ including a nice line break down .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to put pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to work . these can be found under att@@ itudes ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some user bears the columns in tables environments , and can bind all E@@ t sign ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; if this tab is not to encour@@ age tab@@ ulator . although this tab is not responsible for &amp; k@@ ile ; some stop@@ over is added to the column position of the current tab .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code book , it has been extended in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to build special orders ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) there are three different modes for automatic switch@@ over . all these modes can be set up for different working modes including settings . do all these modes can be adjusted .
when start a new environment by the command \ \ begin { surrounding } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ end { surrounding } on an empty line ( for the text ) add to .
when the film button is removed , the last letter of the input can be removed and depends on the same way the list can be di@@ min@@ ished by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; k@@ ile ; alternatively a jump to these positions is possible , so a simply jump to these positions is possible to be plac@@ e@@ ably plac@@ emar@@ ks and the desired settings then be activated .
among settings man@@ ile ; direct ... k@@ ile ; comp@@ ile settings can be made to these lists . there are various sizes for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as orders of the general language used .
the command mode is for the complete set of environments , for the complete set of environments , there are always a great list with \ \ begin to be entered and the entered in the book will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the ful@@ filling of the environments for exec@@ uting .
when calling the full screen mode , the set may be done automatically and the key @-@ button blank + Shift @-@ button , the command can be automatically determined and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment will continue on the eas@@ iest way and through gl@@ itters of the input can be completed .
after this is accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogn@@ izes that it is a first \ \ item command with one command .
under att@@ ach@@ ments ; direct ... k@@ ile ; comp@@ ile settings can be made to these lists . this mode is used to find out the reference list for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; Under@@ cover @-@ defined lists of ab@@ dic@@ ts , which are immediately replaced by extended character strings . the lists can be implemented as an example for example the file ex@@ ample@@ .c@@ w@@ l , which , for example , is included in the example L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for instance , the letter L is in@@ scri@@ bed for instance , and the word for reference to the volume or the key spro@@ cket Ctrl + Alt ON button , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large , large places are not helpful . however , it has been noted that many W@@ ells are written in a document more than once . that provides &amp; k@@ ile ; the bur@@ nings for all of the already written walls are .
this mode can be set up in the menu Settings ... K@@ ile Adjust@@ able . here also the threshold for the display of the sets can be specified .
the complete utility files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the personal Home folder . mode is available for sure ( down ) , Dictionary ( W@@ q ) or tex .
the dialog graphics inser@@ ts the setup of graphics as simple as possible . in order to understand the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be respec@@ ted .
PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but provide an outstanding basis for the re@@ sign@@ ment and re@@ arran@@ gements of pages . the PDF output is available , so you can find the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools are re @-@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to maintain the results of work carried out , the source code must be compiled in the volume . all components are group@@ ed into the volume , creating converting and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for ob@@ es@@ etting such as &amp; eye@@ piece ; or the additional conversion can be used in the default configuration by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and be watched by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when the command super@@ structure is usually called a viewer after the comp@@ ile . should not be used in a embedded viewer , then a new window will be opened .
a new project will offer the menu project New Project .... This will be asked for the following information :
when design@@ ing the filename @-@ window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed by the scripts in the vertical batt@@ les .

all &amp; X@@ SLT ; -@@ sources , which are included by the &amp; X@@ SLT ; file or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
the click of a source in the shown list transferred the text line in the main window at the beginning of the corresponding file .
if the In@@ spec@@ tion dialog should not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen Insp@@ i@@ ences ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the box of the source code in creating the source code .
all the found templates are listed here . it is advis@@ able to apply the export rules of &amp; X@@ SLT ; therefore multiple templates can be provided with the same wire and mode details .
clicking on the shown location in the shown list moves the text line in the main window to the respective line of this file .
local and global variable is shown on a map chart in the dialog X@@ sl@@ db@@ g spec@@ tor . the following example shows X@@ SLT @-@ source code where a global and a local variable is declared .
by clicking a variable from the list , you receive a summary of the summary below . if a variable is a particular expression , for example
includes , then a new XP@@ ath could be expressed by entering a new value for the variables print@@ out and pressing the button .
when pressing a variation in the list is the text line in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
the 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us version ; includes many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all of these tools use compress as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a subst@@ rate . the combination gives quick , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; this is why we know it , and how superior it is . take it one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! not click on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML @-@ processor and ready !
this application is an in@@ dex@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if in@@ dex@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in a certain working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current employment and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time you &apos;ve had started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already been working , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file in@@ dex@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current work folder . if not , then choose current work folder , then enter the folder where in@@ dex@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to a output at the screen , your file is fl@@ a@@ wed . please check the bug and try again .
if the file is already selected high@@ ligh@@ ted in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then the current file can be downloaded instantly . if not , delete the file the check@@ box and select the file using file - file sel@@ ector .
if only want to know if the file well is well , click the well @-@ adjusted checking selection .

specify the name of the file as the result is called to call . the file is normally saved in their h@@ omet@@ own .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even might do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the plug@@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can use the ad@@ verse in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; and the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . more you will find them below .
to install a plug@@ in or a part , we will start with the plug@@ ins menu . the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog gives all the plug@@ ins to manage and add new plug@@ ins . we describe every &amp; GUI element :
here you can input the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location is used and quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the path to search the plug@@ ins .
many people work in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; supports adding team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Projekt Project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self ex@@ plan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several ro@@ les within the project , as is both team manager and Sub@@ project manager .
the user can choose from the list of team members who is looking for . this happens when he looks the team member from the list and ex@@ presses the S@@ etz@@ e button . the currently selected member ( its exp@@ ense ) appears grease after you are : text .
nick@@ name and attitude of your own identity are important for news and notes . see for further information .
beside an overview of your team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it may be an event for information to the team manager , if something particular is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions to be executed if something particular is happening in the project . for example , the opening of opening and end of the project can be seen as much som@@ eb@@ ody is saved , or the sending of a message when a file will be saved , once they will be added to the project , etc ;
events can be created and deleted on the Side Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
an email will be sent to the address selected in the recip@@ ient . the addres@@ see may be a team or sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i such conduc@@ tors will be set up .
remarks are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes Inclu@@ ded is simple . it can either be selected from the Editor &apos;s text menu or entered the ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in an commentary box followed by ad@@ ditions .
notes can be sent to an order member of the Team . in this case , the nick@@ name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) , with the nick@@ name of the team member states , the role as part of the project leader should be listed in the area and sub@@ project leaders , as in the following examples below .
pointed names and ro@@ les @-@ names are independent of large or lower@@ case , but spaces are in@@ valid .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a development environment for sc@@ ri@@ pt@@ - and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is supported and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script@@ ing languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be called by means of Qu@@ anta . Th@@ an dialog covers some pages that are treated afterwards .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding Tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
big / lower@@ case of tags : big / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case means the tags are added as added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
big / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically added at@@ tribute . normal Big / lower@@ case means the attributes are added so added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically include : if attached , is available for tags that is optionally available after the closing day ; inserted immediately .
not optional tags include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and closing day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ counted characters into the respective coding during typ@@ ing .
MIME types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es for recogn@@ izing different types of files . using button standard , the standard offers may be restored .
default character encoding : the coding of new created or in other manner as with File Open File ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) , but this setting is excluded from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . this setting is excluded from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copy , so that with a power failure or crash when the result of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also for not stored documents , a backup should be created regularly , according to the set time .
preview and documentation can be represented either in the ed@@ itor@@ box or its own view ( or documentation into a cardboard box ) which makes it possible to preview the preview and the source code simultaneously .
put the window settings to the default back to the next start is useful when the user interface could change through changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / hin@@ ge of views . it con@@ forms to --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the War@@ ning name range serves the tax of the possibility to dis@@ order war@@ nings by blo@@ cking not anymore .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; you can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as to synchron@@ ize the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in divided mode .
here , the par@@ ser and the structure , which shows the picture of the par@@ ser node in the document .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse kno@@ bs .
in the area of structural timber settings , the vis@@ ibility of the tree can be opened automatically , as well as deep in a change of structural timber . empty areas are the empty areas in the text , while le@@ ere groups are found , with which no element has been found in the current document .
the area for defin@@ ing short@@ cuts ( one type of templates ) , which can be un@@ locked to extensive text . Ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it may be valid for any other means than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ Applications of third page which can be used by every K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application ; while inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in should be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in if it is not at a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be transferred to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file ( path of current file ) or the file folders .
component in the &quot; Flash @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in may be refused the load . only @-@ read @-@ Parts con@@ scienti@@ ous ob@@ jection does not accept the load if this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : if the plug@@ in is enabled , then the input information is correct . if the plug@@ in will not be available , but if the plug@@ in will not be available , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as of version 3.3 , the deb@@ ugger was developed completely new , as the support for the D@@ BG deb@@ ugger . instead of which , a deb@@ ugger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which allows different implementation of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; including .
using the deb@@ ugger for a project started with the selection of a suitable deb@@ ugger plug@@ in in the project settings . with the button options , in addition to the deb@@ ugger plug@@ in option , the specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ugger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us solution ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the contents of monitored variables . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all support points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually , use in the lower dock .
a view in which the edition ( like in HTML ) is shown in the de@@ bug . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the Deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything is or a part of the following functionality available .
with this action , the connection to the deb@@ ugger , if necessary , or it shares the plug@@ in with , on deb@@ ugger that a project is opened , that a deb@@ ugger must not be noticed .
the counter@@ part at deb@@ ug@@ ging session Start the session . closes the connection to the deb@@ ugger or termin@@ ates the noise .
send a HTTP request to the server to use a deb@@ ugger requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view deb@@ ugger output .
pro@@ ves the deb@@ ugger , with the execution of the script , and the current line will run on . if this is done when the script is stopped , the execution is done before a de@@ bug request started , the script will start with the requirement .
pro@@ ves the deb@@ ugger to begin with the execution of the script tag , without information to monitor variables and the current line number . if this is done if a script was given , the execution begins as soon as a request is posed .
the deb@@ ugger introduces the next statement on the script without entering into the functions or includes .
the deb@@ ugger introduces the next statement in the script where possible if possible in functions and this is correct .
displays the deb@@ ugger to go over and go to the next way , as there would be the current .
open a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is supposed to be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the Vari@@ ant view .
with this dialogue a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how to adjust &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your needs , and how to help us &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help can become better .
documentation type Ed@@ it@@ ier@@ pak@@ age ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables us to provide support for mark@@ up and script@@ ures ; your simplicity and flexibility are from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are in two ways to include family 1 , the brand languages and family 2 , the script language and family 2 , the script files and the tool box . day folders are handy , symbo@@ lic deriv@@ atives of cap@@ tions ( above the E@@ diti@@ er window ) , the text and instructions can be quickly inserted into a document when a user could each .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details to convert .
this document describes how to create di@@ XML files , then the &amp; desc@@ rip@@ tion@@ rc file ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ pt@@ rc ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any danger of writing .
tag folders are nothing as a folder . you only contain the &amp; desc@@ rip@@ tion@@ rc file , and the tag XML files . tag folders carry the name of the writ@@ able language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and decl@@ are whether they are necessary , or not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better in@@ sight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter covers each element in detail . everything about the cap@@ abilities and bound@@ aries will be explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains no @-@ element type of itself nothing else .
the type of the tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; argument to function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the day class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . returns the name of the class where this method is part of this method . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common at@@ tribute group and the attributes inside this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
Set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describe an at@@ tribute of one tags . this element can only occur once for each at@@ tribute . additionally , there will be more tags that describe such as this at@@ tribute will be , &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns source codes for the attributes shown in the tag ed@@ itorial dialog , and in the at@@ tribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p metho@@ d@@ ology within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and metho@@ d@@ ology . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that combines the elements of a list . it can only occur in a list of attributes . it is an only element type element .
specif@@ ies the position of the attributes shown in a dialog box . this day can only occur in a dialog only once for each at@@ tribute ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements available within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that finish a day . this item is a only element type .
all di@@ XML files need to start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly acquired and closed .
spaces influence nothing but look out &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would dis@@ appear .
to check the di@@ XML files , the tools dialog above is at the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will be published , whose simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , checking only at charging the day XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following example , for a family 1 di@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ scheme . the filename for this di@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , for a function@@ ing family 2 di@@ XML file . in this file it will be a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the filename of the XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; att@@ r name = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the code port@@ tion@@ rc ; -@@ Data is just a simple and there is a editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D coverage DT@@ D settings . this can be di@@ ed@@ esc@@ rip@@ tion@@ rc ; for you can create an &amp; desc@@ rip@@ tion@@ rc ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be a simple &amp; desc@@ rip@@ tion@@ rc ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
a action can be fixed with setting actions . click on New Action to the same dialogue :
the key@@ word associated with this promotion can be assigned . with clicking on button user you can be assigned a key@@ word , using K@@ one , the current key reduction can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be added a text in the detailed settings and inserted this text in the document to the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually sk@@ rip@@ te , but it is not limited ) which can change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) or the various see in ... promot@@ ions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Script@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to find the % script@@ ing variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% pid : will be replaced with the PID of the running &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be used to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the filename of the current document or path to project file .
in addition to the above methods , a script input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can be assigned to the default entry . in the drop down input , it can be assigned to the default entry . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is normally useful only with this setting .
according to the input , also the output of the run application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types published ; error messages can be specified to the standard version . it can be specified to which the default output is set to , by default the drop down output is set to :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in the case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add and configure promot@@ ions . select Settings promot@@ ions .
the parts of this window are fairly self ex@@ plan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window opens the Edit mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to matching Tool@@ bar .
complete everything and if the day has at@@ tribute , and you can schedule their use , activate dialog &quot; Day Edit , if available , to enter a input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in combination with this symbol ? replace it before we have trouble .
for creating a symbol that the action is better represented by using &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to see what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
in regard to that the day is start , I decided to create a button &quot; button . by using green ( green it usually interpre@@ ted , or should be interpre@@ ted by a message to user ) that click on this symbol is &amp; lt ; started in the current document .
after creating the symbols you have to be connected with the action . this happens to the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , choose it and confirm with OK .
press the Use button and continue with other tags , so there is any thing , or confirm with OK to complete .
supp@@ ose you want to comp@@ lement a few common &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; or it should be shared for a better overview of some separ@@ ator into several groups . adjust the tool@@ bar to adjust tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( on top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after the selection of the element it will be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the arrow to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to preview a fast way to access the quer@@ or . I will list it and add tool@@ bar to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator does not support the group@@ ing . any@@ body , which does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by adjust@@ ing all symbols to make sure that everything works .
do not secure in the correct folder . after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be saved in proper folder . please adjust their &amp; desc@@ rip@@ tion@@ rc file . so , you fit their tool@@ bar ( n ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most not@@ able extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for script@@ ing language or form@@ att@@ ing language , which you like a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use only .
before you start your own documentation , you could be in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository , whether som@@ eb@@ ody has already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; - language . then you will need the doc@@ rc file . then we over@@ ride the second part , we will discuss the second .
# K@@ DE Con@@ figuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = php@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 Level = Table of Cont@@ ents = in@@ dex@@ .@@ html f@@ ting system = basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic synchron@@ .@@ html ...
NOTE the # before Get@@ ting started and Language Reference . this indicates that it is no known limit for le@@ ase depth ( except for the exter@@ ity ) md@@ ash ; but try it out for yourself .
NOTE that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the upper end of the tree view &amp; md@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but look out &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ ourc@@ end@@ at@@ ry .
the table section is the area of doc@@ rc file . for example , if when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the m@@ ys@@ ql _ f@@ etch _ array function is to be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file refer@@ ring .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ rc file , namely to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your file doc@@ rc ) in the same folder as doc@@ rc , and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure these are well worth , send your doc@@ rc file with a description of important info , e.g. which documents were used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository for the use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but are proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative information ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool boxes with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent with email to friends , partners or else . in different places you can send an email menu , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive from where all others &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can be downloaded and only available to sign@@ ify the resource , wher@@ ein there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resource is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case you will need to look for an exhau@@ st@@ ion . in the dialog New asset you will need to keep an exhau@@ sting ( URL preview can be empty ) , and by clicking OK up@@ loading the up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can upload the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , even before installation , investig@@ ated &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the in@@ war@@ eness of the resource is war@@ ned and it can then be canc@@ eled . if integr@@ ity given and the resource is correct , then a notification will be displayed correctly with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages that is currently not from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is currently not necessary to work by adding a D@@ TE@@ P package . there &apos;s a sim@@ pler way to convert an DT@@ D automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be comm@@ enced from the DT@@ D launch and convert a DT@@ D file . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that will be used . after that the following dialog appears :
the target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .

in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . this chapter has to be familiar with these fundamental concepts ; this chapter has to be closely related to these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefits .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this differenti@@ ation concerns a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars over actions is all that is selected in common folder c@@ ture from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of admin@@ istrat@@ ors to secure different tool@@ bars , promot@@ ions and samples in a single user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web developer for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user folder so that users can use only this user .
project leaders are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS , with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which are the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Ed@@ itor@@ box , the buil@@ ders , box cap@@ tions with information and tool@@ bars . please find in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click the cardboard box with the right mouse button to obtain a text menu with the current document pass@@ words , like close to the current , other or all map documentation , re@@ loading , or upload using CVS commands to the current document .
legal st@@ acking in the ed@@ itor@@ al section lead to another context of sub@@ text@@ books , like fundamental editing steps ( cut / paste / paste / paste in the mouse button or Open the file if the string is called under the mouse po@@ inter .
at the end of the editor , the tool@@ bars are present at the end of the editor . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional will be shown as a standard for which a set of tool boxes are shown . in the course of further expansion from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bar will be adjusted to the new features and thus associated user needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate and feed them . in the presentation with cardboard box , documentation , documentation , attributes , attributes , attributes and documentation may be provided .
project management is a powerful tool designed &amp; quantitative information provided in the project and allows to manage all files in the project via right mouse click . actions like add , remove , upload or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of syn@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which link can be used . global templates are always available , local templates are only available for the users and templates in projects are only available in the project .
here you can find information on the available scripts . the concept of the integration into Global , Local and Project will also work here . by clicking on the right button of the mouse , you can delete further functions such as the script to start , edit or send by email .
with this view one indicates the internal structure of the active document . by adding an element the c@@ ursor is set on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking it opens a list of commands to navigation and sub@@ mission of the tree .
this tree appears among the other buildings . with it , lack of attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace can change . the changes of all available attributes can be cli@@ cked with few mouse cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can create a pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and considered project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us has ; two ant@@ it@@ ators at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the us@@ eless information : the windows window and the problem window .
this box shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . so , for example the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this box display shows all error in the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the syn@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are exten@@ sively expanded and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they receive the respective command . the chocolate is the opportunity to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . if they receive a tool@@ bar to compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive an tool@@ bar at an email , they can secure it in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if you have a number of options to get to the configure script . to find a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and run here .
if you have problems with starting from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should review whether your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H to your bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a well @-@ developed development environment with a multitude of powerful features .
during effort , the best &amp; HTML editor , developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a close @-@ up idea : what would be , if &amp; quantitative information would be ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now it is far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore suitable &amp; IDE ; be it .
well , up to the above claim must be kept that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development municipality is based on what a man has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so as they need it for their needs .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can easily increase the automation around any task . by the program Kom@@ Pass , they can still extend their script syntax . ( more on how to find them in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly developed to a well @-@ developed editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; linked to the original developer the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program produced .
more in the details of the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ hel@@ p@@ Center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .

a quick access list of files you have opened . this list is al@@ tered wh@@ en@@ ever you open a file , which is not located on it , where@@ by the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . you should try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project presentation suit , only one bug is reported .
to paste inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there is special characters for &amp; HTML , so that they are correctly indicated and not used by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing reference .
converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Sc@@ rap , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and space in &amp; URL ; s first line to inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day .
switch the block selection and from . that allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script errors are missing !
sear@@ ches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or ed with GUI and pre@@ defined ex@@ pres@@ sions to help you .

- and switching the problem of problem at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main protection . the problem @-@ re@@ porter is activated when to change structure .
displays the symbols of the main window . this column allows you to place Book@@ mark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , it will appear in the menu with the entries of previous or day@@ time , depending on the position of the c@@ urs@@ ors in document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu following the filename of the other documents .
open a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file extension .
presenting a dialog for Insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory after new files you might be . this enables , e.g. graphic files to your project folders or a sub@@ folder , and to add them to the project .
re@@ loads the files in your project on the server . list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more power / output modules ( K@@ IO sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects find out the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . those are stored in the project you / tool@@ bars and are only assigned to this project if you have assigned them this project .
a dialog for storing your tool@@ bars . allows you to select type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialog box to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to store up to you . tool@@ boxes are stored and you will be asked if you want to back up the tool@@ bars .
remo@@ ves a tool bar from the sight . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you are not yet saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
with this way , you can send their own tool@@ bar to som@@ eb@@ ody ( perhaps to the quant@@ um lens ) . the menu item will open a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
allows up@@ loading of tool boxes to the main server , where anyone else can access them . see in .

this menu contains a list of the tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool box . if the Standard ( HTML ; ) Tool@@ bar is available in the menu menu , which contains the list of the tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific lower .
activ@@ ates or activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting Tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . Intelligent Insert means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ tion by tool@@ bar if this day is contra@@ dic@@ ted to the rules .
the plug@@ ins of the plug@@ ins are listed below in the plug@@ ins below . click on it to activate the plug@@ ins below .
select the syntax of high@@ score mode for the current file . the list of available emphasis schem@@ es depends on the list ; -@@ version .

immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limit@@ ations in the K@@ DE libraries , the connection is sometimes need to cause or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition this menu contains an entry for every open sub@@ windows . with choice of one agreement the corresponding sub @-@ window will be activated .
the status bar displays the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
the changes in this dialog include any application that use K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; - web browser window .
the behaviour of the editor &apos;s behavior . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool boxes , or adding the sequ@@ ences .
however , this should generate an help according to the field of mouse player , but it is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative information ; is a qualitative product that is available free and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always require help . if they want to support the quant@@ um company ; evolution in financial form you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the above , since e.g. after the fill of the project name , all these paths and author information fields can be automatically adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example , fo@@ o . when input from name , file is automatically filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file will be stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine to which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
lets you be empty this field , the default values of the selected protocols may be used , depending on the remote host settings .
this is the folder where the templates for the project is stored . it is a relative path for the project and by default templates . if a joint collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be configured instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path for the project and standard tool@@ bars . if there is a common collection of files for different projects , this folder should be configured instead of the standard .
this allows to add files from local files@@ ystem to the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
this setting is great if you have static web content you have to download and change . for ser@@ ver@@ side script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed different .
ho@@ oked when files that are being embedded in the main folder of the project , if a project is not started ane@@ w , not f@@ ish@@ able .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a specific selection according to the good .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook end or by removing the check@@ er , cl@@ amps from the project .
the latest entry of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings , which can upload your work . these settings can also be up@@ loaded in menu window in the sub @-@ window profile or modified using the Shift @-@ Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some of the settings are described in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are re@@ ign@@ ore with project covered operations such as project folders .
additional option to see above , also listed files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project . in addition , more about project views can be found .
the deb@@ ugger plug@@ in can be selected . the deb@@ ugger plug@@ in can be found in . the deb@@ ugger plug@@ in can be adjusted using the button options . in addition , the deb@@ ugger plug@@ in can be described .
in the lower window profile , upload profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a vision for the content of the server for each profile , which show an own structure for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub@@ window of event configuration , you can change action actions and add these actions , modify or delete these actions , if any particular event occurs , as such as the si@@ ckle of a file . see in the details .
by default &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us e@@ ath ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior is currently not affected .
in order to open a different project , select Project selecting project or icon project from the Tool@@ bar menu . the Project Project will open and allows you to select a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . if you want to save changes before rele@@ asing , when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us changed ; same thing happens when you invite a new project .
the project development gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
folder be@@ have as well , however the entries are missing and open with ... im right with the right button of the text menu :
various profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the state of the up@@ loaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will bl@@ ind@@ ed to prevent removing .
the password is kept in the core memory and for@@ got on programming . this option is useful if most common upload files is necessary , and the rather un@@ safe password on the plate can &apos;t be used in question .
this will stop or leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high speed profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile is displayed :
this is the server name to copy the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer log for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed k@@ io Sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
port for transfer . usually this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anx@@ i@@ ety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discre@@ tion . the password will be stored on the plate , but everyone can be easily read in the clear text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , that can be loaded with a simple exchange of view , and replace the current files and tool@@ bars .
p@@ age@@ views can be stored in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most of them . this does not only increase productivity , but also allows adjust@@ ments from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own work .
as mentioned above are tool boxes in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best via the menu tool@@ bars are suitable . use and add tool@@ bars under the section adding tool boxes below .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set to them with a new tool@@ bar ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , which can be done with new action , a new tool@@ bar can be implemented , which can be specified in the dialog , where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool boxes .
by calling the context of a context ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries removal and action were displayed , which are self ex@@ plan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool boxes ... and settings are set .
templates are important in the essential Document string , code cal@@ op@@ es and files for link . such as a usual file system with ext@@ ented organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or any other system in the Vor@@ lag@@ tree ; templates are in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limit@@ ations they are presented to the files@@ ystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the pre @-@ tree below global templates . further information about templates are available .
documents can be created from any text documentation . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple framework for the purpose and organ@@ izes the work in such a way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the prec@@ ursor tree below global templates . see in more information about templates .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be re @-@ added in documents . you can find all from a comment on a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . see in the pre @-@ tree tree below global templates . see in more information about templates .
as the name says , we serve as templates for all sites of templates . you are organized a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder c@@ ture . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
create a document structure based on popular@@ ity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and save file as presentation of local template .
once this is done , notice that ( even if it &apos;s saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out in the tree tree below .
select text in your document and click on File As a template to store as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with pul@@ ling and put on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a pre@@ ference folder . you can remove all file management functions such as pul@@ ling and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting across the file storage of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can choose to create a folder in the file area or in the project files looking to create a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates allow a very target procedure . you can include head@@ ers and foot@@ er and create dynamic with &amp; PHP ; create , add files or link with them . in addition , one can keep some things when using templates in projects .
the preliminary structure in sub @-@ window templates is based on the files specified in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / apps / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as described above .
to specify the folder &apos;s behavior with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a drop down box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ ind@@ ed when linked under par@@ ental attributes .
this is enabled by default and adjust@@ s for everything except the master folders . if a master folder would be dis@@ able , except they would be explic@@ it@@ ly able . in case of a normal folder the bl@@ aj would appear with something like a text module . if nothing appears , there is probably in a tri@@ bal .
allows advance displayed or subsequent text for templates in this folder . this could be general header or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and enables copying contents in a folder with special header lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , you have a complete command collection ( on it , right @-@ click ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and include templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which can be access@@ ed via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source code in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor is as follows : he will publish a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor appears . then you can edit it and if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor to a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ili@@ ate from &amp; PHP ; does not display them directly with the V@@ PL ; editing , it is still the source code editor . there are no plans to change these behaviour .
the second mode is just like the first , except in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor is visible and the c@@ ursor is running in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , the button is offset by the active C@@ ursor from a window to the application , where@@ by the position is re@@ tained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization ratio between V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and source code editor , you can choose between synchron@@ ization following a click or automatically select option . in principle , the recommendation can be set between synchron@@ ization following a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast machines and a big span for slow .
supp@@ ose , you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is also called . as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; Editor . this serves as a new document being created with the V@@ PL ; meaning you can change the following :
met@@ a tags include the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a items can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down below . a click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules to the list below the list . changes on the list is only possible like with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file .

there are many graphical tools for comparison . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated , because one of the contri@@ butors had been correc@@ ted and at the same time it was correc@@ ted to many places . another programmer had changed in the same file much text . the result were numerous conflic@@ ts during comp@@ action .
the program was used for me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no references to the digits , where perhaps only the reverse had changed . the result of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , which could represent the difference within a line and changes to white signs . later , any more valuable functions were added .
if you want to compare plain text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that made a lot of work was compar@@ ing and collap@@ se of folders . this feature turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ c@@ ting perform is fully supported if two people are working independently from each other in one piece co@@ de functions and changes at the same time . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three source files when using :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; will also help you Compare and merge complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; for the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and evalu@@ ates the possibilities of current color monitors . if you have to check code monitors , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab are displayed visible . if lines are only distingu@@ ished in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the left side of the left side . ( no wor@@ ms more if no one changes the reverse )
when a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates that the file is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files are in the same name , but in different folders , you can make the tip by typ@@ ing only the file name for the first file . for example :
col@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 , folder 2 , 2 , Ord@@ ner@@ 1 , Ord@@ ner@@ 1 , Ord@@ ner@@ 1 , Ord@@ ner@@ 1 , Ord@@ ner@@ 1 , Ord@@ ner@@ 1 , Ord@@ ner@@ 1 , Ord@@ ner@@ 1
opening the dialog gives manual type of file names , selecting the file browser ( File ... ) or selecting an recently opened file . you will need to specify a third file in the next time . if you have to run the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
via the button Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the Compare and merge file will be selected , for B and C , but using a file , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filename from A in both other folders .
if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for goal and can process itself . however , it is not necessary to specify a output file later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before you start with the Compare / summary .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare an entire file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; enables you to select text pieces from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active comparison of comparison , you can &apos;t connect to the dialog with the break button .
you can also drag and insert a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file e.g. several similar features . if you need to figure out how to find these functions it would be a relatively large exp@@ ense . you would need to copy and compare these options . now you can easily copy and compare the relevant sections .
NOTE : currently you can delete nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the text of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some ed@@ itors interpre@@ t the pul@@ ling and copy of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text@@ box , the information line contains the sign A , B or C , the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( NOTE that Windows C is optional . ) Every path is too long , let the mouse take a while on line . then a small emergency window will display the full name . )
the three source code matches the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees that the file is different . if both files are different , the default color is for that color . ( color for conflic@@ ts in the settings ) . the color scheme is very useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well .
in addition to the text is the summary column . when differences were found , the column displays the respective colour . when differences in white signs , color is not so important to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + such , white signs are only relevant in string and comm@@ ent@@ aries , for the pre@@ val@@ ence and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column of the text is broken down , where the source file has no lines . if the line file is activated , the line is dot@@ ted line with a broken lines .
the result window ( below the compar@@ is@@ ons ) has also an info @-@ line with the in@@ scription Output : , the filename and &#91; am@@ ended &#93; if you already have the result . usually , it contains the automatic mer@@ ging already text , but often it contains conflic@@ ts .
! ! ! to all the conflic@@ ts dis@@ sol@@ ves , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to be found in un@@ con@@ sol@@ ate / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflic@@ ts . )
if only two compar@@ is@@ ons are used , any difference in the manual is to be resol@@ ved simultaneously .
due to a click with the left mouse button in one of the window , the first line of the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then emphas@@ ize the current group . it will be high@@ ligh@@ ted using the color background color for the current range and on the left the screen appears a black beam .
sometimes , the automatic mer@@ ging or through manual operation does not leave any more line in the group ; then in this lines the text &amp; lt ; no line in the quot@@ ations ; this text is not displayed in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you might copy and somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; collap@@ sible ; however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this feature .
NOTE : if selecting the sources you ign@@ ore the Options or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in figures or comments are also treated like white signs .
navigate mainly with the image bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard buttons , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can also use the keyboard buttons in the beginning , at the end , at the end , Str@@ g @-@ Start and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w can also be used by other programs to navigate directly to the navigation .
in the eye centre you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Insert button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns backs up the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as described in the section , and editing the ed@@ itable out@@ line ) .
the tool@@ bar also contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference ( Ctrl @-@ picture back@@ ward / Ctrl @-@ picture back@@ ward ) or for the next / pre @-@ resol@@ ved conflic@@ ts . therefore , not automatically solved the conflict . therefore , must be distingu@@ ished between sol@@ uble and un@@ solved conflic@@ ts .
to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( Ctrl @-@ C or Ctrl @-@ Insert ) . if this option is activated , you will always log into the cli@@ p@@ board , but be c@@ auti@@ ous with this option , but you might be acc@@ ident@@ ally over@@ writing the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line @-@ po@@ ds are stored according to the under@@ lying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ return character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Wag@@ en@@ tion + \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the source of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and will be restored on the next Start . ( menu Settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with a firm width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides scripts with variable width to choice you should not use it . )
if you enable this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the chosen font is not supported , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be displayed in their pure form but would be rendered automatically . on these systems the knob adjust@@ ments an un@@ awak@@ ened color .
if this option is activated , the key number is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
when you enter entering or Return , the line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy then drops the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system .
when compar@@ ing files is att@@ empt@@ ed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all of them can be ig@@ no@@ red in the source files . only during this first step , white characters may not be ig@@ no@@ red in this step . in this step , white signs are not ig@@ no@@ red . also when co@@ aching , white signs are not ig@@ no@@ red .
some ed@@ itors ( on some systems ) store a car call@@ sign &apos; \ &apos; r &apos; and the line @-@ back switch &apos; \ &apos; . usually ig@@ no@@ red and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car call@@ sign be visible , but if this option is visible , the car call@@ sign be visible , but the default is to be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are not shown in the result , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intense according to smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default settings . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic re@@ jump mode this setting , how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ solved conflict is dis@@ continued .
automatically sol@@ ves automatic conflic@@ ts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection ) . if you are using it better if the auto selection also affects conflic@@ ts in numbers or comments if the options are ig@@ no@@ red or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + -@@ comments enabled .
these options are discussed in Section to scan folders and merge tracking . see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merger .
when a file is saved and an older version exists , then the original version will be the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if such a backup file is running with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , this will be deleted without a further backup .
the language of user interface . the change of this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop and start to start the change . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE release of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is adjusted there globally via the control centre . )
the following coding settings can be configured separately for each entry . if you are activated using this option , the upper settings will be used for all entries .
a brief indication of the cho@@ ices for the coding is a brief indication of which the local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has a pure inform@@ al character . )
Custom@@ ize the file coding for source files . this affected may be treated as special characters and can be interpre@@ ted individually , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
when you edit a file , you can specify where code can be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ ach@@ uting commands , it might not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files can not work 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the pre @-@ working command can only be fixed with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
turn this off to press any changes in white characters into text or reviews . ( NOTE : this also applies to changes in figures or comments if the options are ig@@ no@@ red or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + -@@ comments enabled . )
this selection is available only when you compare three files . in normal mode , you &apos;ll see only the differences between two of three files . according to choose from A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C ; next to the normal one another super@@ vised column is displayed with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
ordering the comparison window to each other or above . this can also be useful to displays long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click will perform collap@@ se and uses the file names for output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ start the merge file , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can remove this function for example to cut off irrit@@ ating parts or correct the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command , and the command of the command has been given first ( see above ) , then the issue of the command is only used when line @-@ up command . each input line must have the corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to enable users more flexibility when saving the D@@ iff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program the best . however , the good news is that in most cases ed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
in this context , use this pre @-@ working order for line input : S@@ ed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The . * is a productive expression of any character set out in the first clamp . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CVS and other Ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some keywords to automatically recover files ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word subst@@ itution ) . thus you will change the same pattern $ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ _ BAR _
while you experim@@ enting with S@@ ed , begin to understand and perhaps you may think this regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs to support the very similar things .
the Ign@@ oring of figures actually is a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ working order for Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ etting &apos; s / &#91; 012@@ 345@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit will be replaced automatically .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple arran@@ gements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to dis@@ connect the objectives of each other . for example :
instead of S@@ ed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; Aller@@ dings are only for per@@ l some details . where S@@ ed \ \ ( and \ \ ) are only needed ( and ) without the set &apos; \ \ &apos; . for example :
the data after the normal pre@@ positi@@ ves are kept for display and co@@ hes@@ ion . the other operations change only the data that the line @-@ off @-@ Alg@@ or@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
NOTE : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ processor comes as input from the normal pre@@ processor .
the processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences and in worst case important data .
often , programm@@ ers need to process many files in a folder . this is why you can compare and merge complete folder to a folder .
... power a proposal for each object ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and sim@@ ulates the sim@@ ulated changes without them truly perform ,
... the selected actions can be made either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only selected by the selected objects ( F6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the Compare and merge of single files . you only need to specify file on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged then Fol@@ ner@@ 1 is used as a base . if no target audience was given , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as the target group .
NOTE that only the comparison of folders will automatically launch the mer@@ ging . to start collecting , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
while downloading the folder you will be inform@@ ing a little news of the current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files listed below were listed until then .
if the file is completed , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of list with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder can be found during the scan , shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder c@@ ture is usually displayed together . you can double click on the + / - click on the picture or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions of the sub@@ direc@@ tories and all sign@@ atures can open up with which you can open all folders .
if you double click on a file , the file will be started and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the symbol in the column name reflec@@ ts the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail of the selected object . in such a case , the coll@@ ision rate will not be selected automatically . if the result will be launched , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as in the above picture is shown in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if its overall content is identical . then , folders are the same color . in folders , the age is in@@ significant for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a sheet which is only green then becomes yellow and later when it &apos;s old , red becomes .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a file and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such fl@@ a@@ wed objects may exist , the result cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a file and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such fl@@ a@@ wed objects may exist , the result cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active if only two files and no explic@@ it target audience were indicated and if the option direc@@ tories is synchron@@ ize . then select the necessary promotion , thus both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : summar@@ izing and the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible filen@@ ames for output file only B ; directly after combin@@ ing copy &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the new file will be selected , then you exam@@ ine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and if the files are different , but the date is identical .. as such , the date is not fixed , the resulting file may not be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if in alignment dialog the file compar@@ ative analysis is selected , K@@ AL@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved problems , un@@ solved , white and white conflic@@ ts . ( the column for resol@@ ved conflic@@ ts will only be displayed if three files are compared or merged . )
you can result in either the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . when you have selected all inter@@ net@@ ting actions ( also in all sub @-@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have not given an target group , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C will be used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merge B will be used as target and for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as target .
if you have selected a target group , please check if all entries are to be displayed in the folder area , and there are some options through certain entries might be sk@@ ipped . check these options to avoid un@@ lock@@ able sur@@ prises :
to result with all entries , select directory setting / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key symbol ) . to perform only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F6 .
if by contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still exist , a notification appears on the def@@ ect elements . they can then select a valid action .
if you perform all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options run , sim@@ ulate and break .
Sim@@ ulate Sim@@ ulate when you would like to see what would happen without that really changes . you will get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads to specific action with all entries . if a manual input is necessary ( combin@@ ing a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screenshot ) .
when you are ready with a file , you will re @-@ start log@@ ging / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; make a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will proceed to sk@@ ip the cause of the problem . so , if you proceed to dis@@ solve the problem , or to avoid the problem , you may proceed to other way before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries were individually merged , not@@ ably &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries ( in the current session ) and results in later , all entries are not stored again . even if you change the merge connection , these entries will be guided once again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ reducing 3 ... ) has now a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern list will be displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . there are several samples to be inserted . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . file must not match this pattern .
files and folders made in this pattern are not displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . it can display more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . the default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .

ign@@ ore files that are also ig@@ no@@ red by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set using a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a h@@ ired -@@ at@@ tribute . this option allows you to decide whether these files are displayed in the element name or not . this option is enabled in the default settings .
in links to files : if the option is disabled , symbo@@ lic short@@ cuts are compared to the option , the files will be compared to which the links will be disabled .
if the option is switched off : if the option is switched off , the links such as normal files are compared and rec@@ ur@@ sively per@@ spectives . ( note : a link to a folder itself would lead to a file of the loop itself and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es . ) This option is dis@@ missed in the default settings .
performs a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics @-@ columns . ( the number of un@@ solved , un@@ solved , not - white and white conflic@@ ts . ) The complete analysis is being applied s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , which contains no text . ( enter a pol@@ em@@ y anti @-@ sample ) .
if you compare large file over a slow network , it may only compare the chang@@ er date and your file size . however , it will cost you a certain measure of safety . please use caution . this option is to@@ g@@ ging by default .
simil@@ arly to a chang@@ er date . there is no real comparison instead of it . that can be equal to the same if when copying the chang@@ er date is lost . please use caution . this option is to@@ g@@ ging with caution .
activ@@ ating synchron@@ ising mode when two folders are compared and no target audience was selected . in this mode , the proposals will be identical . the results of the files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled by default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered un@@ certain , because the other file is not modified also . you should check this in any case . ) This option is dis@@ missed in the default settings .
if a file or a file is replaced by another file or delete the extension .@@ original If an old backup file is already deleted , then this will be deleted without another backup . this also applies to the normal operating result of individual files , not only the collap@@ se whole folder . this option is switched on in the default settings .
normally , the Fol@@ der merge operation remains visible to the combin@@ ing single files . if you do not want to move the window divi@@ ding window with the mouse , you can switch the window folder in the window menu , switching between the both views and text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file using double click . however , you can use a single file directly from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be settled , and the file will not run again if you start the folder .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ AL@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders based on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a separate archiv@@ ing file with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . some things you should consider :
a path can be relatively und@@ .@@ or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , stand@@ by &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , due to the file system on the server sometimes , a short list of limit@@ ations follows :
or it cannot be distingu@@ ished if a link indicates a file or folder . you will always receive a file as link @-@ target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option to be conf@@ id@@ ential . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently available as a differences @-@ viewer in K@@ De@@ vel@@ op . K@@ De@@ vel@@ op starts the right mouse button of the differences between the differences and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part of the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files ; however , it takes a patch file in Un@@ ified , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the patch exists in the Un@@ ified format . then one of the two files must exist . then start and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch needed to recover the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the text menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this file doesn &apos;t work if any of the original file has changed since creating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the part is executed , only the compar@@ is@@ ons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the quot@@ ation or the list of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ D@@ iff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ is it comp@@ are ) there are already . moreover , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it may result in diff@@ 3 from the D@@ iff Tool @-@ Collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot while living in the sources other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that have taken this way or go to it .
you probably have the program comp@@ iling from the sources and the configure script may not be found the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( such as k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the REA@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are dealt with as identical ; but if only one @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated as not identical . i@@ F r@@ lines , next to each other , this is is co@@ inc@@ idence but this is is the case .
the editor can be noted for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this important information is lost when the result is stored just as text file , and it is too much effort to design an extra a file format which could save this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can still produce a certain version of a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly missing ; No src left ; published and the text can &apos;t be put aside . what does this and how can this be removed ?

only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder , and therefore not in the target group .
( in current program version , you have to update the folder with the update feature in these options . )
it will only be displayed entries to copy the differences in the target file . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing after the target . ( behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is dis@@ missed in the default settings .
NOTE the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window . if the lines are already available , they will be removed during clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are handled as differences in white characters .
the &amp; kp@@ ager ; shows a min@@ iv@@ orous look at all virtual desktop . it is quite practical to change their size on the working areas to finish it or move them . this will work both within a desktop as well as multiple .
the &amp; kp@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop areas , including running applications . these applications can be selected and even moved on working area and to other areas .
with the medium @-@ button a window can be moved inside &amp; kp@@ ager ; the movement can be moved within a desktop as well as other desktop areas .
the text menu depends on which the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on : if on the empty background of &amp; kp@@ ager , it is cli@@ cked , the text and the name of the application and the entries may minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on working area and end . commands of the following commands :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the working area . appears only if click on a application .
sending the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when you have cli@@ cked on an application .
this approach can be marked with window inside &amp; kp@@ ager ; s can be moved to the middle of a button in the middle of the desktop and also shif@@ ted on other desktop areas .
when this field is crossed , the &amp; kp@@ ager &quot; name will be displayed on the virtual desktop .

&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse show a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from RS@@ I syndrome ( re@@ pet@@ iti@@ ate @-@ in@@ spir@@ atory syndrome ) , and that every mouse click pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse ze@@ iger have prepared a while on the same spot . it is thought that every mouse click pain . furthermore , it may em@@ ulate the pul@@ ling with the mouse , but this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; can the pain handle when the mouse comes and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , suffer from pain , you should consult a doctor if you are not allowed to take a doctor if this is not done .
to clear it once again : even if &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against ains that are caused by the use of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic aid supplies , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads out a mouse click as soon as you interru@@ pt the movement .
is the smart shif@@ ter activ@@ ating , makes &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; a break , wait until the end of the mouse button . in this way , you can carry out the mouse button . the smart shif@@ ts requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it .
this period has to spread out after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click out .
is an intel@@ lec@@ tual moving switch , the time shif@@ ting move ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is stopped , the mouse button is waiting , before the mouse button is left again , if there is no evidence of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; now supports a slow motion by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . this moves are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es@@ .txt ; the first time it started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears out , you can get &amp; k@@ de ; to connect the reaction time . open on Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; start at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; available only under &amp; k@@ de ; please select the respective documentation for Rate to find out how you automatically start a program automatically .
if all settings are reset to the values , when opening the dialog , you have already pushed the button , the settings are reset to the last hit by using tigh@@ tening .
at best use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pre@@ ferences . in particular , the smart shif@@ ts should be p@@ amp@@ ered at first . if you then click the automatic mouse button , you can later go to the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : the clicking on the neutral review of windows or on locations in the browser window , which does not lead to un@@ certain reactions . you can &apos;t park the mouse to such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should pur@@ ify your mouse . it is normally quite simple . the tri@@ ck can &apos;t just clean the mouse gel , but also the ro@@ les that come with the mouse h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere .
first , you must remove the mouse h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere . like this is done , it should be clear from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the ro@@ les . these are located on the sides of the lock , which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can easily scr@@ apped with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
in very rare situations the operating system interru@@ pts the execution of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just begun in this case the smart altern@@ ate means that &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; the operation does not end through the batch of the mouse .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; move under a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists , that you can run a mouse click here . by this , the status of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse cli@@ cks and thereby putting the c@@ ursor to another point .
solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor to place where you want to make it out . but if you don &apos;t want to make your mouse on a neutral field . secure zones for mouse po@@ inter are h@@ iding ; the grey surfaces around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title line of windows .
I try to work with the smart shif@@ ter , but I do not create it to edit text .
the smart shif@@ ts is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can move it . it is very likely to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or to re @-@ end it in the cli@@ p@@ board . but it will probably even take problems . here are some advice here :
use the smart altern@@ ating if you just start to use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; please select one end of the text area to use and hold the Shift key , while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and click again the mouse button .
do not use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way , when &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is ex@@ pressing a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart shif@@ ter also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but for this , it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window must be installed . this should be the case already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and are set correctly .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; st@@ ressed the mouse button soon as soon as the mouse po@@ inter has been created for people that suffer from RS@@ I syndrome , and those affected of the st@@ ains pain .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured for a particular time that a pul@@ ling process begins , before the mouse button is left . in this way it can also be carried out using the mouse .

probably you have set the order for the voice output not properly or in@@ complete . open Settings k@@ mouth ; build the page general settings and specify the command for the language edition ( see setup dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ er are currently supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without restri@@ ctions .
in order to show a command line for setting the voice command , it is assumed that the festival is in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ TTS is a language generator . currently he supports only the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ TTS with free and without restri@@ ctions .
in order to display the command line for setting up the voice command , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS will be installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ us@@ etts . the speech output is possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option has to be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a listing of Ph@@ on@@ emen to a Wav@@ e@@ eme . this license allows you to create the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text at phon@@ em@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the acceptance that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to provide the last sign of the text so that an additional character must be displayed . the full command is therefore el@@ abor@@ ate as in other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; c@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data is to be switched on .

K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being used in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since setting the voice generator only takes place in K@@ TT@@ SD , you &apos;ll need to use only as possible as possible as voice services in &amp; k@@ mouth ;
for setting up the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the spe@@ c generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that cannot speak with people who can &apos;t talk , lyrics by the computer . there is a list already saved pro@@ positions which can always be re@@ printed again by the user .

an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partly .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list above htt@@ ps : / / send@@ mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you must install program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher and properly set . see also
when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet had not been set up , the card card will be displayed . see if you have at least one speaker , the map map will be displayed . see .
most TTS syn@@ thesizer provide various languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such that can set themselves in volume or speed . you should also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer , and you should use at least one speaker . you should use the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with multiple prints for the same printer .
when you click on the card reader in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card will be displayed . this will then automatically start when you start dict@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and is not a speaker .
all the advanced speaker appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the top spokes@@ man will be used for voice speech , when there is a speaker .
with a mouse click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the nar@@ r@@ ator on the list . the sequence of speaker in the list also determin@@ es its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; act ; -@@ System .
choose a pitch type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a ma@@ iden and girls .
if you click here , appears on the new speaker on the card card speaker . to change the settings of this talk , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; come back to you . go back to the map illustration General and check if voice command is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) you can start reading and manage to read text . click to read and manage text orders to read and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the voice command from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map illustration General to open this map chart . here you can set some general options .
Mark the check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this is successful , and you will start reading the K@@ DE @-@ TTS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the marking , will display K@@ TT@@ SD and the TTS System by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr ends , run &amp; kt@@ ats ; continue , unless the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this is high@@ ligh@@ ted and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system field of control bar , dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start text orders , stop and record again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click OK or OK , then all changed settings are applied on all pages .
the card card will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the map illustration of Android and cross there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web site . check first and read the text that will read and select from the main menu tools text . after a short period , the language edition should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web site . you can also sk@@ ip this step but then many &amp; HTML are also read off and other invisible brands also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . then check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs first , and select the text that will read and select from the main menu tools text . then read the voice output .
this also works if &amp; Kate is embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notify you about events specified by you . you can also read the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ts ;
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can build different types of messages . you can exchange &amp; conversation ; for example , you can be not@@ ified if your nick@@ name comes . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can read the IR@@ C message ext mentioned in an IR@@ C channel .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ ify , appears a menu entry notification from the menu adjust@@ ments this program . the settings here for K@@ Not@@ ify will be different according to application .
filter for the string replacement filters provide a good opportunity in &amp; rec@@ t ; incor@@ rec@@ t or incor@@ rec@@ t messages to correct ; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which can be sent out or incor@@ rec@@ t messages , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed to be assumed . read too .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not necessary .
in filters , text is edited before he is sent to the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation , to make false spoken words or short@@ cuts , or to make certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thesis and their voices .
to understand the work@@ ings of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts .
the output of screen read@@ ers has the highest priority . it will be pre@@ loaded to all other orders and will hold these contracts . if the edition of the screen Reader is read , the re@@ stra@@ ined contracts will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor turns to hot . a warning has the priority and keeps the edition of messages and norm@@ alized text . these jobs will be continued after the issu@@ ing of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interru@@ pts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application that you can read by &amp; k@@ mouth ; one long text on a web page you can enter . &amp; k@@ de ; Not@@ ices are also news . read more .
the rest are simple text jobs . any order that you are using a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example for one applications which have text jobs are thought for the issue longer texts that have no particular urg@@ ency .
all four order types will be ready in que@@ ue , except the output of screen read@@ iness . if a application sends the issue of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such an entry will stop and termin@@ ates this output .
first , you must know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen read@@ ings . it will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text jobs as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news .
filter editing the text and continue to pass it on the next filter . there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
replacement parts replace parts of an text by other text . the resulting parts can be delivered either as words or as regular ex@@ pres@@ sions : - ) by text or for the format of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; available in a better under@@ stand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Rec@@ re@@ former use a X@@ SLT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; provided by a format into another format . included some X@@ SLT files to the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with spokes@@ person fil@@ tering , you can send contracts on content of the text , or depending on the text , sent to a speaker . if you have sent a female voice to a speaker , you can read the text by K@@ DE news about it . &quot; read more about it .
each of these different filters has set the rules where it will apply to a language edition . if the filter indicates that its rules is not applicable , he will continue to move the text on the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or an &amp; k@@ de ; - notification will be sent automatically by all activated filters , which are arranged on the side down below . the mach@@ ining by the filter are processed in the list from above .
this displays the list of the matching normal filter . is a filter not crossed and will not be used . filters are processed above from the top down .
click here to add a new filter . choose the style of the filter , and it will be shown below the following entry di@@ alogs .
for setting up string filters you need to enter a list of words or regular ex@@ pres@@ sions as compar@@ ative pattern . the text will be replaced in text , then the text will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text .
enter your filter a name . this name you may choose any number , it must only differ from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of the words and regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string bet@@ s in the column match and replaced it in alignment with the string of the column . the list is shown in the displayed order from above .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular ex@@ pres@@ sions from a file , save the current list , and list the entries from the file to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter will only be used when the speaker is given in the text order to display a list of languages . you can also select one list of languages available for mouse click the &amp; Ctrl ; -@@ key pressed .
here is a value assigned , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs by using Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will receive you with the program q@@ fig@@ . . if you have to get rid of the program . if for example &amp; q@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 may only be set .
the filter replacement filters can only be applied to the text if all conditions on a box in the box Di@@ esen Apply filter if necessary . all entran@@ ces is empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when compared to words , the character set @-@ based ex@@ pres@@ sions of regular ex@@ pres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . words must be limited by divi@@ ding marks ( with space ) on both sides .
in this manual you can find no instructions for writing of regular ex@@ pres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogues . press release &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; phr@@ ases you will find in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former transl@@ ate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from one format into another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ ations . however , the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path to the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker @-@ selection filter you can send lyrics to a certain speaker , which can be submitted on a speaker with specific properties . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter , sear@@ ches for the text . the speaker is published on the spokes@@ person for the text . the spokes@@ man , and the properties of the speaker , set up on the card selection filter , you can transfer the chosen speaker .
if a value is registered , the filter will be applied , if the text has the given regular expression . is installed on your System &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; pres@@ sions installed , you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anch@@ oring the regular expression at the beginning of string , i.e. , start the regular expression of &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you specify the properties of the desired filter conditions . if the text showed up the above filter conditions , the speaker will be chosen to show the desired requirements . click on the button to show the dialog selection .
use these buttons to store or upload your car settings or delete all settings .
the speaker sel@@ ector is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Apply filter if necessary . you need to apply at least a condition .
the speech output API , of &amp; k@@ de ; can be bor@@ ro@@ wed with the programmer to l@@ end their applications TTS skills . applications can communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD can be added so &amp; kt@@ ats can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ port of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both API@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require short output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the agenda to the property K@@ Speech .
text of the text is to read and option a language code like C@@ eg ; EN , de &amp; etc ;
there are still more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you can .
open two &amp; console ; window . launch kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; XML ; conversion filter set , but using the module for festival pages are not read .
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone even if you don &apos;t have to read S@@ able at all . you will also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c have to be installed and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or interaction signs appear faul@@ ts during the syn@@ thesizer , so all pro@@ positions will sk@@ ipped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch output . what can I do to it ?
first , make sure that the option string values are set to the correct value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain characters or words , may be solved by a string filter . see .

the syn@@ thesizer , used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license which you can find in the associated documentation or on the associated web pages . there are also voices that own a own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also download the code from k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de .
contains many languages , a list of all supported languages currently available on the htt@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zulu and Ib@@ ib@@ io .
the KT@@ TS works with any audio syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in one &amp; console .
the list of the above mentioned languages can be un@@ completely or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , after information , which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ tive module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you wish to expand the use of another syn@@ thes@@ izers , use the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for XML ; conversion filter is not necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compens@@ ate &amp; rec@@ t ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages to c@@ del@@ ib@@ s and the development files for &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source texts by &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility , or all the night you have downloaded , install and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first speech dis@@ pat@@ cher using your voice syn@@ thesizer correct . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program called kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be so further developed that the speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual movements . the user may re@@ ject pro@@ positi@@ onal or ab@@ sat@@ ile , repeat the output or break the output .
when a application text to &amp; kt@@ ats , you can request the properties of the preferred microphone for the output . if you are using a speaker , the language of English and whose sex is female , it will be chosen by the best suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker you will see in after .
if you click on the map speaker , click on the list , and to add a speaker to list or on Edit menu , the card &apos;s map speaker will be displayed . as an example , the device can be shown for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found here .
enter the path for exec@@ utable festival program . when the path comes to festival in PAT@@ H , you will need to enter the festival only .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to Festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; General applies , this setting is automatically performed . General applies to Western languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ der you can adjust the volume , sound speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls , this will not be chosen by you chosen this settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes require several seconds due to their size . if you have loaded the check@@ box , these voices are already loaded when using K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greatest memory usage ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not got any nar@@ r@@ ator ( or forgotten on request ) . see .
if this check box is marked with the launch of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start it is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon window to display the program window .
if this follow @-@ up is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not going to read it in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD read a text . by doing this , you have the possibility to read or control other .
here are all contracts on the que@@ ue , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the straight pro@@ positions . the speaker ID equals the column ID on the card standard .
with the buttons in this series you can turn on the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order is made of several sets ) .
with a click OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other card types ) is reduced and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , please click on the audio map audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen read@@ ings , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; be found here .
select the kind of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ats ; either no support for the corresponding audio module is compiled or rec@@ t ; may not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de can be used for audio output , select the audio output in the list . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . see here the PCM device . see also
the microphone speed is here : 50@@ nbsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal microphone speed . that these settings may be implemented , the program must be SO@@ x .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; act ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this map chart you can create special actions which will always be executed if the text order is interru@@ pted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of language orders :
the output of screen read@@ ers has the highest priority . it will be pre@@ sided over all other tasks . after the edition of the screen Reader was read , the re@@ stra@@ ined contracts will be res@@ umed .
war@@ nings have the upcoming priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor will turn to hot . a warning keeps the edition of messages and norm@@ alized text . these orders are continued by the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interru@@ pts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application to read messages . if you &amp; eg ; just send a long text on a web page , but you can gre@@ et som@@ eb@@ ody who enters the room .
a text order is interru@@ pted by a message , warning or issue of a screen re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the que@@ ue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interru@@ pted . if the introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory messages , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map chart are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and issues of Screen Read@@ ers , there are no specific actions , if they are interru@@ pted by a message with higher priority .
to read by &amp; rec@@ t ; K@@ not@@ ify news , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on not@@ ifications . the map indic@@ ations may be not@@ ified .
Mark the check box in order to dis@@ continue reading &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not marked off , the other settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; reads no not@@ ifications before .
if this setting is marked , not@@ ifications to which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
to add these buttons to add events to the list . if you click on the button , a dialogue in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before reading &amp; conversation ; sent by someone in an IR@@ C message your nick@@ name .
all events , for those in the list , nothing else is given by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ig@@ no@@ red .
use this drop down to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts should do if an event applies . you have the following selec@@ tions :
if you select custom text pre @-@ selected text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the properties of the desired microphone . standard select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card card speaker as a top entry . see also .
NOTE that there are three levels of events . if a specific event is set out , this action will be executed in any particular application . otherwise , the promotion will be adjusted for any other events of the particular application . as the last option , the promotion will be adjusted under standard ( all other events ) .
the event all not@@ ifications for the application standard ( any other events cannot be deleted from the list . this allows you to specify the not@@ ifications as follows :
use the button saving to store the settings for the not@@ ifications to a file . when loaded with an empty list , click on del@@ eting . all entries except all directions are deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice &apos;s voice and the sound height . plus marks for controlling the instruction language , for example Ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standards .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . following limit@@ ations are present :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival is used with the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration options are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on spoken .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML release = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; 1.0 @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE speak PUBLI@@ C &quot; - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis ? &apos; / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis ? and who has slept in my bed ? he asked the bear . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two kinds of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ing filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . thus the first set can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , because only the first set can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can start or cancel and cancel , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you see the set @-@ up filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a default set @-@ up filter is automatically set up . you can change your settings or add another set @-@ up filter .
on the eas@@ iest way , you can read the set selection from and give text to read . on the card selection , you will change some properties and check how the selection of the microphone has changed . to this , you have to set up more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start with the pre @-@ read , since only the first pro@@ position has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can submit text orders then on the card card orders or cancel , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer is not supported .
for these reasons , the normal sentence filter is automatically set up when you can launch kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can not be disabled , not only be removed , unless you know what you do .
the set @-@ bound@@ ary filters compare the text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign ( dec@@ imal characters are removed from the text automatically before fil@@ tering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ ills ) , war@@ nings , messages or issue of screen read@@ ings .
if you remove the standard set @-@ up filter , you can insert it once again by loading the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
selecting the card selection , you can write speaker settings for application . the card card is displayed if
using the standard law ( the highest on cardboard card ) . with other words , there are no spokes@@ person for speakers .
when using the appropriate speaking voice , all the features of a set @-@ fit microphone has to be clear or edit , elec@@ ts &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker sel@@ ects . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker out , the most originally introduced features .
select the method for entering the desired disk properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired script . if this property plays no role , you do not give anything .
Mark the check box if the property sh@@ rang before other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when the output is dealt with , it will always be used as a priority feature . if you may want to specify the at@@ tribute language , if you know that a particular application was sent in another language than the language listed in the workplace .
to be able to clear all properties in the area , which is most likely to delete the following button , click on the select button , and then to speaker , which correspon@@ d to the short@@ est of the following .
in this case there is 0 for the last text order in the que@@ ue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately if it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ it support but I don &apos;t get back to trace .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and kt@@ ats ; it was completed . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command GST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not resol@@ ved , possibly a not compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update track and un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output about AL@@ SA does not work if I play a text order at the same time . if I get a text order , fri@@ ezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : un@@ able to open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that conflic@@ ts in AL@@ SA may prevent the same time opening of several PCM devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can &apos;t use it in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice anymore .
add the new vote in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch with the &amp; URL ; by which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card card audio , there is a setting speed . that this will work , the program SO@@ x has to be easily installed and on the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ es such as festival games can offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this active voice is active or active .
the settings for the sound speed will be ig@@ no@@ red when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is in fact that the speed is controlled ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you &apos;re all bra@@ ve , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ Um@@ former@@ 5 , and set up the sound speed .
I do not manage that web pages are read with a female voice . I set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able gender does not seem to work , thus the X@@ SL file thro@@ ws out the X@@ SL file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the Gender @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own character set @-@ up filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; not more sat@@ ile fore@@ - or return . on the cardboard box it is displayed , the order is only from a set . what am I doing wrong ?
interaction signs ( point , script@@ ure , identification symbols , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be fil@@ tering . use a filter for the typ@@ ing code instead .

Festival is one of the best free TTS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices are generally good and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can volume , sound speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help you find out in the instructions that are delivered with a festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you must comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the sources of the festival . German votes are subject to restri@@ ctions in the for@@ warding .
this voice takes a festival of 1.@@ 95 beta , or later . the voice is still in early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / rus@@ sian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you have to enter a Cyr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; search the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the option should be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use Russian voice , the option should be set to a 8 @-@ bit cy@@ r@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ Syn@@ thesizer will be used . then Festival takes over the electronic edition . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; , one module for the &amp; Co @-@ control@@ center ; , which allows managing the network interfaces , which allows ut@@ ilities and DNS settings .
Co @-@ control@@ center ; enables the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings through a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; co control@@ center ; can be called by selecting from K Menu k@@ control@@ center ;
the &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings at &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; displays the network settings ( kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting from control@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf file system cannot install . physical equipment and their drivers have already been working and configured , thus &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; the device can be displayed at all and allows adjust@@ ing network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed for installing &amp; Linux ; you will need to install and set up your network devices later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module settings will be loaded when the network settings is selected in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index selected . when starting the module settings , this system used to automatically detect the platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the platform is offered to select the platform out of the list . by checking the setting Not @-@ again , this setting can be perman@@ ently hit . during next start of the network settings , this option will automatically be set pre@@ set .
changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode . in previous system configuration mode , all options can be displayed , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will need to enter the password mode at the lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system administration mode , the complete functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used for managing the network devices . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be done :
the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click at the button of the Extended settings .
with the selection of Auto the TCP / IP settings of a DH@@ CP server , or BOO@@ TP Server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no further configuration is required . in the list box , you can either find DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system .
with the manual Manual , without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is marked , initi@@ alize the system &apos;s network interface when the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensu@@ red that the IP address in the network is not used to enter a TCP / IP protocol . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off if required . power @-@ off from the list is selected by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off if required . dis@@ able an activated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specif@@ ies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be submitted to the network where the gateway computer is to be selected .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org is requ@@ iring DNS this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.90 .
the calcul@@ ator on the name resolution part of the R@@ iding name resolution allows simple management of this list . entries can be added , remo@@ ves or modified her@@ al@@ ings in the list with buttons up or down down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons up or down in the priority .
adding a button add ... from the group computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . the dialog of the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver will add .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and add the button to click . the entry will then be inserted into the list .
from the group computer to name resolution select an entry and then click on the button ... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list designated computer names describes host name @-@ to @-@ IP address of uses for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting an DNS server . in small , closed networks , it may replace DNS servers .
usually , list designated as popular calcul@@ ator , list &amp; ap@@ os ; local@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses can still be supported in the review of IP , in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click on Add .... The New file dialog is displayed .
click on the name of the well @-@ known computer and add the button to add . if the famous calcul@@ ator has several al@@ ias name , de button add several times and enter another al@@ ias name .
choose an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit ... The Edit calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then click OK on the list of static hosts .
the settings featured in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the Homepage of &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; htt@@ p : / / kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ is ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool with graphical interface as package @-@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; but in addition , the development charge includes libraries and others .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile these commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology are given , in the second all are discussed by &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files .
this area can not replace any further knowledge about IP networks . in this App@@ endix contains basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never found major pre@@ val@@ ence . from IPv6 it is expected that this description is mainly focused on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the main information is the knowledge that IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network admin@@ istrat@@ ors that can be used for a valid IP address , if your IP address can &apos;t be chosen any arbit@@ r@@ ary !
when creating an own small ( home ) network sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be selected for this purpose to avoid IP adres@@ ses using the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not transferred on the Internet , so their any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the range from 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is suitable for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all hosts are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( local@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP supervision .
the 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 Network address is reserved for the IP transport in the local own machine . normally , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; kn@@ et@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes al@@ tered by DSL connections , so that it doesn &apos;t be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , another content is considered to be specified .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file will be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ peri@@ config . another stand can be expected .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a security program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first goal was to answer a question for tar , which got my wife : how much longer will it take if you are sec@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; educ@@ ates the band and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ er of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the sp@@ ell are not asked if the band will be form@@ att@@ ed .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the sp@@ ell will search it after the right index on your plate . cannot be found if the band index should be created .
if all goes smooth@@ ly , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the tape is inserted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape .
prior to thro@@ wing a tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accompl@@ ish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; give you a change in symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band , and shows a message from the status bar . the tape can now be cast off without danger .
before a tape can be used , it must be form@@ att@@ ed by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a belt file must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can use a band before using &amp; k@@ dat ; and if you need to form@@ att@@ ed a band before use , this process needs to be form@@ att@@ ed before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; so you will need a form@@ att@@ ing of the band name , DA@@ T drives , however , will not be form@@ att@@ ing .
after entering the band name and the capacity de@@ parts &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the tape is lost , the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you must select the files to secure . this may be done in three ways :
choose a file or folder in a local file area . it will only be saved this file or folder .
Mark a f@@ use profile in the tree . only those files are saved in the profile .
create files in a local stream tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
with the right mouse button , click on the local extensions and select menu to the ...
once the backup is directed , the dialog for F@@ use . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog gives the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
Mark a file or folder in one of the archives in record for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry . ....
as soon as the test procedure was started , the dialog for checking . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking the review , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the examination as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ produce the restore , the files you will need to be restored , and this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or folder will be restored .
create the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only those files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
with the right mouse button click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu ....
once the recovery process has been launched , the dialog for restore . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work folder for restor@@ ing .
if you have confirmed the settings for restor@@ ing , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of recovery as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it shows itself as necessary to create the tape index file using tape content . this process is del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of tape :
this will create a safety profile with the straight files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a f@@ use profile :
the current work folder , where the backup should be done . the list of files will be updated automatically according to the chosen folder automatically .
for all folders who are listed under backup files that are listed in the same file system , like the folder . folder , which can be applied to any other file system , you can separate separately from the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ cre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shots will be used . only the files will have changed since then .
the file name , which is used to determine the changes since last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shots before the call of tar . this causes that all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and , and lt ; files was not yet implemented fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings for the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for tape drives ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the belt system .
is this setting active , transmitted &amp; k@@ iller ; before the band is bound by the command to load the drive . in some drives this is necessary to read read or write oper@@ ations .
is the option switched to block &amp; k@@ dat ; the draft at the tape drive . possibly this setting didn &apos;t work for all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the release is replaced by &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically e@@ jected to the band . use this option at flo@@ ppy stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable log sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; one band form@@ att@@ ed , writes it to the beginning of the band . this file should display only a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file uses as follows :
( N byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is host name : second , where host@@ name is the full name of the system , when the band is form@@ att@@ ed , the number of seconds , which have been form@@ att@@ ed since the epo@@ ch , form@@ att@@ ed in the band .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file using the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar @-@ archives created directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar , even other tar versions should work as long as it is not in incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup band . this symbol is only active if a band is inserted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is not suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t retri@@ eve information about your system , or where system allows you to perform the different protocol files ; experienced users access information about problems that can occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where system changes the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows for the quick access to the example on problems that perform on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; thus attemp@@ ts to provide some advanced features , which can be filtered and analysed according to their help .
in current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has developed ; a number of useful features , including among others :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sys@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also contained in addition and are explained in further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screens you can see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions , with the help of the single protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily fil@@ tering and sort . the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start attemp@@ ts &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol will be launched , so you will not start with system administrator . the protocol files will usually not be found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user normally have no just@@ ification for reading .
you can also use the filter bar in order to fil@@ tering the filter bar in order to clear the filter bar . in the default setting , the list contains the drop @-@ down menu , which will only be displayed for selected filters . then , in one of columns , the default values of the filter search is included .
you can also select another entry in this place . for example , in the protocol command system protocol , you can only select the column process , and carry you out into the filter bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent and created by this process .
this option is enabled in default and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors will be displayed using a display color lines of step @-@ lines . the color depic@@ tion of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to see only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can find the process identification as for example , if you would like to exam@@ ine the output of a certain command as for example , using the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the main menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; enables dis@@ playing multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open and manage the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ windows . once you selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has a website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ s@@ oftw@@ are@@ .@@ org@@ . D@@ ort you will find more information about the source of supply units of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it rapidly developed into the standard for checking the program start at the Hoch@@ cycle of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it &apos;s easier to use , powerful , and also more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it yourself : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . This is why someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ install and new form@@ att@@ ing . therefore , you need to make sure the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one of them .
the Sys@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a whole lot of scripts . basically you need to start a script for each system service , you do not need such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services does not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be able to run under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you require it . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run out there if you have to do anything with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ ject . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can design a look into the second column . if you want to change that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair any changes , then you can repair it by adding the system , and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ L in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder you cannot find correct files . instead , every entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it actually accepts a argument as start and stop . you can actually start the scripts of your hand by hand on the command line :
this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one contains a K , the script will be called stop . if it includes an S , the script will be called by argument .
some people wish for a simple way to create machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run @-@ level , that can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; run it also could also be a user -@@ Run@@ level ; &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you get the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; and it should not be very difficult because the program was as user friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is easy to say not to say tri@@ vi@@ al : draw an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to stop him on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also change scripts between Run@@ lev@@ les or change their position within one level , in which it is somewhere else . this will not be drawn by its original run@@ level ( or his position ) . this happens if they pull a entry from the existing system services .
please note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you need to select this in a new run@@ level . you must select explic@@ it@@ ly copy from Edit menu or select from the menu window - even then , if the same entry has already been existing in the target area of the action .
sometimes the sor@@ row number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the modified entries , before you can try again the system service .
please note : there is no way to re@@ produce entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the different operating areas ( run@@ level 1 Start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ ursor keys to hit a selection over@@ - or below the current .
to move an entry into another round level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use Ctrl ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( Ctrl ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ row number or name of a single entry , press the tab button to change the Properties dialog button , to accept the dialog button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to re@@ ject the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu requires a confirmation before it is executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc file , if it is available . otherwise it will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc file .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ lev@@ les , and now the machine is constantly new . what can I do ?
enter LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ sc@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; as a run@@ level X version , but it will not run .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , like system services in these distri@@ butions , unfortunately , the configuration for the propri@@ etary inc@@ en@@ tion programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning a extension of the program for that approach .
if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and if you are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are easily termin@@ ated without message if your configuration files are not available or false .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . in case you can use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be attached .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; is it sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you &apos;ve made changes you have to save this . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card types , the user and the user group list . for example , choose the desired users or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user or group properties .
some maps are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you have extended system settings , you will be able to make individual settings , if shadow -@@ pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ x@@ es .
the password manager will appear if shadow -@@ pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d may be installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ x@@ es .
this map illustration only appears , if for at least one embedded file system limit ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogn@@ iz@@ able to the file quot@@ a ) . here you can change parameters at any user , where@@ by the restri@@ ctions can be changed in KB :
this parameter can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected using the field monitoring system .
the card card groups inform@@ s about the group flag of the selected user . the standard group , at which the user belongs , you can find the user in other groups , by selling them in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select from the menu users or group or click the matching Add button button . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group is analogue .
with this module , you can add the LI@@ LO bo@@ ating system to modify and change the boot pass@@ words , adding the time to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , remove , change , change , change , change and more .
