<seg id="154">The split of original and unemployed files is simplified for a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or an abstract picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to store metadata in & digikam; if you forget that EXIF data and IPTC data can be written in the file, then you can easily select the metadata in the database by clicking the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Well, you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change the metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, real work begins, since you should select any photo of words, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all images that can make the same attribute. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's talk with jacks, key words, as you continue using other programs often hot, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import the catalogical images from another source with embedded jugs, then & digikam; automatically add the tree to the right place and can easily rebuild the images in the tree or simply by moving a tree to another. the modified jacks are followed by & digikam; updated as the underwater being updated.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata are covered. this is a very coarse representation, as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. file name and calendar data is the properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labelling or comments on the third important tool to katze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They don't want to see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to arrive with your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. out of the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer look at some details, then you'll start to see people, the square.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historic period is again present, you may even listen to the silence. the label has been completely modified your perception this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others, consider the title is possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you are showing pictures you should tell you a story. if you are taking pictures, you should help you understand about the motive that you can understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's ok when a picture is not perfect if it's the strength only to work with a labeling for themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam; you can export a lot of text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), when you export your pictures in web galleries. so you will find it into the labeling and / or the title of the web gallery. you need to tell the story here for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before googleearth? well, because with images the train of the spatial presentation is already running with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of the Geolocation are already innumerable, and will surely be deeper in the future, you can also export your journeys through images with geographical data. you can also export to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google's Google Earth viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word match with copyright and denotes the practice of copyright to remove the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for working others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information is stored in the introductory page of & digikam; as information, should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for verters and author): this field should be used for your name, or the name of the photographer, e.g. when it is not desired, the name of a company or organisation is not used. after that value, it should not be changed. this field does not support comas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autoortitel (Synonym for author Line): links with the author. examples of this field may be the job title of the photographer. examples of the photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer. since this is a merchant for car field, must be also completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (Synonym for provider): use the provider's field to identify who doesn't have to use the author. if the photo is for a messaging agency as Reuters or Associated Press, this image can be found here, then the image will be shown here, the group / agency has been shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and Copyright Sections, although this is not a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calculating or change the solution for this problem. for private persons this is for the majority of your photos only by gerinexpensive interest. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each image. & digikam; in the near future a special module for stacking processing is provided.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topic: PLATTENFEHLER, record loss, blackout, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, dessert, temperature, temperature, data size, spread superstructures</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that lost on the road or a brand. this type of losses are the same that can happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, these are problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest data stream company, has some interesting statistics for lack of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be careful and you cannot tell you more than a few years. of course you can claim CDs and DVDs in archives. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & Dollar; 2 pieces which have a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. if you have the believe in your space player.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you are good Disks and good recording equipment, they are not much more expensive than the cheapest one, but you write a lot more reliable. thus it turns out to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for mistakes, even if you have just been written. therefore, they are only effective data, the remainder we needed for formatting and control problems. despite this massive protection they needed to dry algae, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a reasonable program called IsoBuster. it runs under Windows and Linux; but it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications that damaged data of damaged disk, hard drives, Flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks released the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly sixty the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all of which to CDs and DVDs was also applicable also for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">If you are slow to check the data with a good recorder on high quality media in a non proprietary format. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can start the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">DiskMaker adopts your statistics. your manufacturer's warranty include a new disk, but not the data. Google will provide a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives: dismiserstudas</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks keep up at the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. if you are operating in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C, the most common error messages are due to the immediate emergency. these are especially Lesefehler and exporting. the expected lifetime achievement is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss because of overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss because of a current account before you have secured the files, but these losses are usually made back without big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices does not make a lot of power, that can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. thus, these anomalies can cause severe damage, destroy motherboards and other defects. thus protect yourself in front of the avoids loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity tips is an overload protection. this is a device that is absorbed and the rest. it is normally in the form of a connector strip. but don't think any plug-in power may also contain an overload protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overload protection, then take care of the UL 1449 standard. this ensures a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care which provides protection against flashbacks and thus protects the connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can be used on your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices that can be connected to your system. some manufacturers make overvoltage causes and also provide an overvoltage to your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overload protection. a large number of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection is using your system in front of the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure in seconds can lead to loss of essential data. it can therefore be meaningful to invest in continuous power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltages, these devices can be able to store and run down the system. some models allow them to save up to the current. if you have a UPS according to it, you should be sure to get the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of battery and the provided software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that is exposed to your computer system and compare it to avoid paying attention to avoid this. a high-quality overload protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you get used to avoid any cables. at the end, you should always remember to cancel all cables before you go into your holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service. with the right configuration you can connect this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to save the backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer to store data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives, they are very expensive - 40 Gb cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & Dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but there is no general backup solution. it is too slow for it.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com place online storage services that are available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB. the professional variant offers you more available, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you will receive unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very secure. transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and in the offer is a backup and a distribution box. so they are desirable.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are vulnerable for transmitting errors. the filesystem zfs and btrfs are at least the data integrity between operating systems and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you don't say if a transmission error occurred. all these disorders remain uncovered until you have no protection in your computer. nobody ever seems to have it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is much more secure than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transfers, since they produce interaction within the data stream, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by games problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates to be able to handle and highly scalable license for Solaris and Leopard. we only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its supertrfs file system. it is still using the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms which are used for & Linux; but it is still not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">It does not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of the losses in notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. for notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Loss of data loss because of viruses is less common than most cases. it is currently limited to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently only limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFs, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent misrupte data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the trial process is higher and an undefined status is not completely stored before the problem is not completely stored before the problem is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses include the greatest threat of digital data: wrong, theft and human error, the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are located 1-2 aperture values of fundamental physical limits. there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and robberation for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are in the direction of the 10 Megapixels. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more comfortable for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">"a 750GB hard drive will get you today for 100 & euro; so do not require any other loss of data loss. so, if you have any data loss in any data loss. so assure your data often after a plan and test it any more dangerous than the reinstallation of your operating system to make the exchange of disks or change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash gives you happiness when the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. forget airlines: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data or a whole room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterprevenation always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs to the neighbors, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as described above is a common reason for any data loss despite fuse the panic. if you have a backup which is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and poses a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential: a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete system. creates a complete snapshot to two intervals: the complete safety and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of files that have been changed since last backup. creates multiple snapshots. this backup is made back to one such backup. this backup will only be retrieved in the next one with the exception that it is only decreasing and not going on.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily copy to your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts. this is actually compressed and if you want to increase your safety about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Assure important images directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach brings you enough time to discover and restore action. at the same time, you come to the fuse and get back to the same time. at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after you have completed a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, associated images stored in image files, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, relocating images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">With that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year, it's about the time that you really interested in you are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you have to consider what is said today. unfortunately, there are no other possibility to manage and rate oneself every day. in less variants you are used in the past, so easier to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the explanation of the explanation in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: anyhow when you change your computer architecture, your memory and backing technology, you should review your library and if necessary to convert newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have to have the scalability with you and the area you want to put on a dedicated record or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and put it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command if your new record has been recognized by the system, but don't hang it on.</seg>
<seg id="235">& USD; dd if = / dev / SDB [#] of = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC & Dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can be read, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier to make this task a year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which slowly disappears from the market.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been created as an open source standard. but it can store a lot more. it is lossfree, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata. it is possible to save gamma- and chromatiity data for a improved colour assignment of heterogeneous platforms, but not as many as the present and a slow compression. this format would like to recommend you to saving your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread as a picture format. it can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossfree compression rate. a problem is, however, you can print your pictures in this format. it is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open frame image that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed now for using metadata. a handful camera controller is now available, and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon as well.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe's XML based XMP technology has introduced to & quot; Cinsible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF; the file information will be allowed with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers dragging it before a original of your photo, mostly stored in the raw file, because it is possible to archive the metadata separately from the image file, and the image files will come and see if you are using to use if you use the container as container and place it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation offering a wide range of applications and business models. among the activities of DCMI's work on architecture and modelling activities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and workshops, standard connections and workshops to achieve a further acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert Rohfiles to DNG and save them in your repository. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digikam; then you should add the metadata again. these were taken from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export it in web pages, add in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the section you will find a description as you can already add on your hard drive, but the camera interface makes you a lot of advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; connect it to the computer, switch on the display mode and turn it on display. another description of this camera will be found in the handbook of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a ferocious indicator show at the bottom end and the examples of all photos on the camera will be displayed. if this is the case, the filename and a symbol of file extensions will be displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you might need the camera information form to any entry. with the sidebars and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information to be stored internally of the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer. NOTE that some digital cameras wouldn't be available any information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer note, GPS, etc of image files. those information are the same as in the metadata side bar of the main window of & digikam; or the image processing. NOTE that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is downloading, click on the button to download and then download the photos from your camera to a single album in & digikam;. downloading the photos will be downloaded and we will be sure to delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos download, you can only select the desired selection methods from & kde; once you select the selected photos you will use the button to download and select Selected. the button selected is as long as you have selected to select some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera is supported this, an option is now available. these images have not yet been selected by & digikam; downloaded. in this case, the new pictures have been selected by a star in advance. if you select this option, the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you are using the buttons, you can download all of the selected albums, where you can download the target album, displayed as normal folder, displayed in the folder. details for folder assure can be found in the section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete all of you from the camera. if you want to delete all files you wish to delete a few, so you must delete these first and delete check out.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possible photos that you have been deleted from the camera, you will need to delete whether the photos will be completely erased out if you want to delete the photos from the camera. if you are completely erased out of the camera, you should be able to delete it over the camera image, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos frequently will not be utilized after the photos from the camera. this can be meaningful if you can load photos of different recording items in the same album, so it can be meaningful, the date and time, to integrate the image in the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and skewer image quality. if you use this latter option, automatically create a folder a day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer opens three more options, which are carried out before the photos can be saved on the record. if you select this, the respective entries are copied from the EXIF data into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% M: add the option date & time. for further adjustment you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you have the opportunity to change the filename in lowercase. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; is used for a photo, is being stored below the name, and the camera will be stored in the Preview and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to set up a automatic swing while running out. not all cameras are ready to use. in the section bar metadata you can read more details about the information you have embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, you will use the automatic lathe up and select the automatic rotation in the lower range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera has been made information about the date, which is made available to you, you can download & digikam; this substitute will be stored in the target album. all images with the same date will be shown in the same subtitle. in the section Sidebar meta data, you can consult, which information may have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually disabled, and in this case, you will need to change this option. if you want to change this option, you need to set this option on it and select the date-based lower at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The simplest way to load photos from their computer to load them is the button to download. choose uploading. you can select the file select dialog & kde; you can also select the uploaded file. you can also choose more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digikam; you, where the pictures will be uploaded, select the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term being used in this document, which is indicated on a map which can be displayed on a map. the identification of data can be performed by American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not just for professional photographer you can associate an image with an accurate geographic place. not everyone uses a plane to caring an area by automatic recording of GPS data to kartografting. environmental planner, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was made, you can view the area by clicking the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digikam; user you can locate the location of the photos, it is good to locate the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is what is the GPS data in the image? first, you should know that exiv2 are many GPS data fields, such as the direction, saddle and map reference to the geographic assignment of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to geographic assignment (manual) and most of the manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera which has integrated a GPS unit, but there are a few that work with GPS receivers together or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">The GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, these data must be stored in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data from images and GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>

<seg id="288">The IPTC promotions store the data into the corresponding IPTC field. thus it is achieved that the metadata are constantly contained in the database and are not only available in the database of & digikam; and these metadata are also available in & digikam; imports without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Pictures as embedded labelling (JFIF) in JPEG pictures, save the comments, which you can add to your photos, with the images created in the images. thus, these labelling can also contain from other image locations, are overwritten by the account of & digikam; overwritten.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by clicking the button updating right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the illuminator of & digikam; can only be set on this page. some pictures have to be switched on this page. some pictures you have set different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have one, then you can get a better result.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the picture processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select the toolbar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. this method can be specified here. in the image processing, this method can be switched with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-Subsampling is meant that images in a higher resolution of luminance is coded than in the colour formations. please read this article in Wikipedia about the Closer.</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as you have a lossfree algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can reset this value to a high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF-files you can connect the deflate compression salgingm for TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF-images. it does not have an impact on the image quality because the deflate algorithm is lossy-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save low loss. even if you have been posted loss of quality loss and file size far better than when this paragraph is written, metadata were not yet supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam; the picture processing was only a viewer for photos. currently it develops very quickly to manipulation of your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default utilization is that all green pixels are immediately connected to ultraviolet light when using this option, dissolve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option records a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 mesh-pattern with the VNG- or an AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used. otherwise, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is it a solid color balance, which was photographed on a white card, based on the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the user's the second sensors has the effect that the lower images will get more details in the tip. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the high-edge, so the parts of your camera will begin to catch the pointed out of your camera leading to the inability of your camera. you can try to reconstruct some parts of the shooting in various roses. at least, you can try to redesign some parts of the missing informations.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels is not so fast as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcrab try to redesign the missing green and red shares of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you will get the option to set a level. this is a value of three compromise and can therefore be customized for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Add the Luminaire value to your taste. you'll probably need to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1. this can also be obtained later in the image options of & digikam; -image processing, you should proceed to the time for the Demosaicing.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing -algorithm is a digital picture process to get a complete picture of the partial data being used, which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of color transparent. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw make you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation, and AHD interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity direction), the first algorithm was created by Dcrab. he produces color artefielding on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lentils, you can set the red and blue screen values here. this is certainly the best method for a color application correction since you are carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color formations and releases how they should be given up like this. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information like the colour space from a colour space to the opposite are thus the colours as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour Ask, when a picture is opened in the picture processing, start / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Click here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & digikam; examines the file then during the list.</seg>
<seg id="315">On the ICC profiles, you have here the option & quot; Standard squot; can be left for your profile. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures and does not run the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be fitted to the camera type and model that you are using. not all profiles are shown on the same type. currently corrects dcraw Gamma not for converting at 16 bits depth. this means that you must carry out the colour mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft-Proof profile, with which you can emulate, like your image of one device would be back, as your printer has been printed a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated, rather than to rely on the flash algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious to what colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not for the models of Canon. therefore, this follows a table of cameras and profiles. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion can be found the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for screams and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing; many modules are supported to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. then select the list of available modules. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window of the main window and in addition, you will also find a look at the context menu of the menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are done by modules can be revamped in the menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI-modules can be found in http: / / www.kipi-plugg.org or in the books of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of diaschau should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the video outputs, usually 4-5 seconds. the other Ancrucible switch off the metadata or off, which are inserted at the lower end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera functions are displayed on the left side of a list of all supported cameras. on the right side above, there is a button automatic detection, which is attempted to identify a camera, which are currently connected to the computer. below are the port settings. currently, there are Serial, USB- and USB / FireWire-mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / order, please enter your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digikam your digital camera, you need to connect and turn the camera to your computer.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digikam; the camera automatically detect. if not, you can set your camera or manually set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any number of your camera for your camera. if you have more than one camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirming settings dialog for the shifter of &gt; images in the trashcan, you can set up a look at an album. in the sections of a photos and deleting one album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right side bar can be used tactically by & digikam; apply if you are using changes in the right side bar without any queries. otherwise you have to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also enter the display of the welcome screen image by & digikam; while starting up. this accelerates the start procedure of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting up searching for new photos is forced & digikam, looking for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam; if something from the base file was deleted, asks & digikam; you, if it shall delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digikam; used to adjust the main window to your taste. you can select Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digikam; you will find further information on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikon; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and improve your photos. the picture processing can be started by clicking on the left mouse button on the preview and selection of the details displays / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The picture processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you are not part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can be installed in the section screen.</seg>
<seg id="339">A flag line at the lower edge of the window, the filename, current filename, magnification and the current picture size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at upper edge and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing of the picture processing changes your photos. however, the original photo will change the original photo before using file Save or button saving of the toolbar. NOTE that you can't recover the original photo, once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly produce a copy of your image, before you can change it. you can save with file Save.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the image, you can restore the original image by installing from the menu file, recover from the menu window. you will lose any changes you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting the editing or restore reproduce from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are using this often, you should get Ctrl; -z for reversing and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; you can press the back button in the toolbar at a moment. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can use the navigation bar in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation bar in the toolbar. if you have any changes in the current picture, you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can use it in the picture and zoom in Ctrl; Mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the cautious menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying transfer automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode. usually, you will not want to use the Esc key. usually, you can call this in the settings dialog by & digikam; you can call this in the settings dialog by & digikam; main window. see the section on setup of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print in the File menu and get the default & kde; printed settings. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole movements. all pictures can be printed out of your selection. you only need to select the images from the menu album exports. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The image window; main window displays a side bar on the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for the selected image files. the same side bar is available without the navigation file, also displayed if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple times click on the same tab the side bar will appear or disappear in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the lettering view, you can insert lettering with unlimited size or insert it. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels can be copied to the EXIF and IPTC Fields which can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 signs and are produced by special characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented them, use either the button, or change easily to the next image, the labels will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the use button, there is a button more. with this you can read more metadata in the selected file or the database. but this will always be carried out if you have selected a metadata setting that will always be written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars. it can be used in a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar, or with the shortcuts of the side bar. to rate several pictures at the same time, select these from and use the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is in the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword index shows a search box for filtering of the keyword, the subject index and a selection box with the previously in this & digikam; session occupied this words.</seg>
<seg id="362">The subject index is adjusted as dynamic as a keyword. you can quickly restrict the number of options when looking for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief for input at a picture series. if you have entered different passwords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Passwords can also be placed in the tree as well. all the key words are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you can select a keyword in the subject index and do not apply to the entire selection, if you want a selection using a headword, please read the index bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar index is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - data, index and search engines. if in addition one or more bulletting filters are used, only the cut volume is displayed on the right side. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull and cool down. suppose you have selected multiple pictures when the keyword exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection. next you will ask if you want to reset the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the subject index is set to no query, which has been selected on three images. they were set by Ctrl + a and put it here. a dialogue is asking whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place with any start of the program. it can also be switched on different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it can be one or its, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry according to which in the database is sought. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that has already been set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can also specify a widest search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button options. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you set a colorless modified workflow is that the colors show you from your camera or scanner. with a colour-managed workflow, you can achieve the colors on your monitor from your camera or the colors you want to print or publish them in the web. publish them from your digital nightchamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject goes on color management, everyone wants to know what buttons must be done for the results he wants to provide you with deep background information about color management. in addition, you should make you more information about color management. in addition, you should make information about your own information decisions so that you can obtain the required result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image is executed all six below criteria, you must not worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working in a monitor of the sRGB color space (further information below).</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions have been sent by e-mail or web, where sRGB is de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is doing so well and life for everyone makes it so easy, why should one use another colour space and make thought of colour pampons?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can see is shown below. it shows a 2-dimensional presentation of all colours that we can see, the hufeisendeformation region, and the colours in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional presentation of sRGB with some bigger colour space, so visit Bruce Lindblooms excellence page and then click information About RGB working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to vibrate my monitor if I have decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you're working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to get your monitor lined your monitor. if you're using a RGB space using sRGB, you will need to vibrate your monitor on sRGB using sRGB, using either monitor using the sRGB standard or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before using a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, dislike, Automatic and contrast extend from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction try to experiment the best from your colours. they are experimenting with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method casserts the whole picture above the whole picture, so the dark point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shaded. this function is often a magical correcting for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Abstract: this method adjust the brightness of the selected image, so the histogram of intensity in size is as flat as possible. thus, this results in order to achieve a very powerful operation that either works wonders on an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic off: this method maximizes color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright front shades and adjust the red, green and blue buttons on the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enlarging the method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values by moving the lowest and highest values on the highest possible area and a refraction of all values dazwipe. this is only visible when selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad pictures.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a bit limited to a colour space with 8 bit per colour. in case you can perform it too far from the original image, in case you can perform the white balance in drawing mode, so your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance and protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it on the menu entry colors white balance of the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The loop thing can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side you can see both the original image and preview of the target group. if you want to see the original whenever you want to look back the original image, then click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target pictures has a red marker. the luminance of the image below this markers is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right upstairs is a histogram, once you have a parameter change. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels is very small luminaires. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or what is displayed. the sum becomes Luminous.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or download the attendance details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the picture preview for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance. on this type the temperature and green values will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one colour channel is exposed. this will display the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and does not have an effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and loading are exactly this. each setting of the white balance will set you to save and reload them back in one text file.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob adjustments all filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white balance. see also neutral settings as your original. when you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Here you can adjust the coding per colour channel of the revised image format. 8-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding is also required for high-quality images. this codings are also needed for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be applied to the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu of color and color correction. this tool allows you to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always take you the same error and therefore you can always find the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A powerful way to correct ventilation program is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; Tools Farbeet effects introduces four colour effects, a pyvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, solar cells was also called Sabatier, a effect of which has been replaced by the extra light. the result was a partial negatives of the image. this tool was a partial negative effects of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar cells. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. an additional increase is generated only a negative image that is not generated on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is (1) and the processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -Effect. it differs from a saturation that makes it a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth. simply try to embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a colour optimised colour of the Japanese company Fujifilm; and thus a reference for its smooth screen structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strongly represents the film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias are also some photographer, especially those of which are hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates Neonlight at the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and shift gear. when using large images the filter can cut the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color-effects of your photos with the tools in the menu. once you are pleased with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem. even in this case, you can increase the saturation. all changes you can see in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the result with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple light intensity / contrast / Gamma is the tool needed to improve the exposing. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need for the field of shooting. specific the three shifter below the histoprogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, an histogram, of the active channel or of the selected area. under the graph, three shifts are clicked, to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and right side of light areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn operation is to move the regulator and look for sure how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side you can see the original and preview of the image. the preview is dynamic, updated on the left side of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis is displayed. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic release is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top spot for dark tones, medium for bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often gammavalues often called.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pushes can be used in the preview of the original image, to adjust the input values of the shadow, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is one button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow to change the selection values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values. for example, the compression of output can be used e.g., for example, to create something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: using these buttons can be stored and reloaded later, the Gimp levels are used later.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and use the three color pipet, you will adjust the color pipette automatically for all shadows, medium and sun blocks, and click on the preview of the histoprogram for rot-, green, blue and light beam.</seg>
<seg id="430">The an overload cell dictator controls all colour channels to show overexposed pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels. this is what you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, and output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target screen is displayed. the preview will be updated automatically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel which is altered by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures featuring a digital camera, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode is higher.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short venting to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that this bright tones will correspond to a dark tones and the corresponding picture pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark visible. if you change this markings on the area you want to change the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off, until the value is adjusted after your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with these buttons you can make exactly this. every curve you can create and loaded with the file system and later the file format is the Gimp curvenformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you are using this method and the three color pipet buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun. please click the original image to set the control points for the rotary, green, blue and Luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The an overload cell dictator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixel. if in more than a channel overexposed aggregate can be found, you'll get the effect only displayed in preview and it is no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminous channel. shadow and sun was applied to the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and it corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Channel Mixer of & digikam; image processing is a tool to improve the channels and change color shaded images.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix colour shades of images. you can process it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first reference like you can correct the relative distribution and impact. the left side of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target pictures has a red marker. if you can position this in the picture a vertical line of the histogram order to display the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Checks for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction, you can easily change these channels. if you want to reactivate the visible color components, since you can also select the screen for creating great black-white converter from your photos. try the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochromatic, the reduction of a colour is visible in the same place in the colour channel, and whose noise can be different in every channel. if this is the case you can improve your monochromatic conversion thus in which you can reduce the farmyspace.</seg>
<seg id="447">The store and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any kind of mixer can save you for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The an overload cell dictator controls all colour channels to show overexposed pixel and you can view the combined result of all channels. this is what you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in the blue channel. option Luminance is activated. the original image is under (1) and the picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating, because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography it is black / white one step, since color pictures can be easily converted to the machine. also with a set of film rollers.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white movie sighting with a green lens filter. this looks more well, among all the sceneries and fits very well to portraits against heaven. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) Grünfilter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangerter: simulates a black / white movie sighting with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air pics. so similar to 002 Cokin (tm) Oranitorter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white felt tip with a red lens filter. this produces dramatic asceneffects and can simulate moonlight curtains for the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow-filter: simulates a black / white felt tip with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similarly to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow-filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and middle tones used to add a bit of cold in the shadoption. this is very similar to the trial of a print and repeat development in a pipean. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus much of the 005 Cokin (tm) pipiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using & digikam; server texture, you can apply Decorative textures on an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a colour image, or not, you can look like a painting of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged dots or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this image.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the depth or three-dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper Textureffect is shown on the picture below. the original image is (1) and the changes in (2). the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Adding the & digikam; tool frame, a decorative frame can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a beholder in the limits of a photos is not a slight task. this is to keep its attention to the image. this is a psychological barrier for discovering eye. under the frame the module can be launched out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set up the desired frame type for your picture. immediately converted the picture with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), converting it with a nice three-dimensional setting of ideal for a touch frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original, but it is important for printing the images, especially if you have previously used the tool by aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert easy-format text into a picture at any point. this also goes on multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply use text shape, orientation, color from the color space and character set. the larger the picture, the larger the character set you need. to finish it, you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background. this image is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you have saved on the button "OK" after the picture is saved once the picture is part of the picture. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digikam; you can apply a template on a picture using the & digikam; tool template.</seg>
<seg id="470">The picture below stencil template used in image processing can be used to create a picture of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For a stencil there is no restrictions in size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format and should be to add the PNG format (9) to reduce your stencil files. if you want to add your stencil template to you, send us an e-mail in english to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-Users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil with the button basorder in the dialog. select the folder in which you will have stacked the stencil files.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root ordner for the stencils, a tree view is reflected in the stacked setting of stencil. selecting an folder will be updated automatically by the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the Preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magnification and change your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the present image. it is centered around the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Reduction: this button is smaller than this image. if you want to use the mouse. if you want to use the mouse, you must remove the image accordingly. check the image accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move Close button: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and set it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to use the template onto your image. the picture will be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has preference in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and simple, but it is, particularly in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unshadow mask is going to look at the contrast of the edges to make a painting. they can use it's more psychovisual Dunst. they can use it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this is why this means that the digital phenomenon can be printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be printed on paper. SLR cameras does usually need more subsequently than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG pictures, a camera in internal sharpening has been widely used. images in the raw file must always be sharpened in case of processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner has a sharpening filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by taking a photo with the sharpening value. you can also call the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should move slowly, because the results are not very natural: the focus increases the sharpness of the edges, but intensifting the noise. in general, you can focus more information and on the menu entry. you can also find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a bit soft to sharpening, is much easier than it. use the tool to remove the switch with the menu entry korrigate and experiment with you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Imp Masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help you edit the image. the showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount should be tried first. if you produce the Unity Mask, hides and produce the impression of grats near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is a lot of pixels which are affected on each side of a edge through the filters. high resolution images allow bigger radii. therefore, you should focus on the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the managed picture which is added to the original. thus the starch is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a split from the maximum RGB value and using the differential amount. thus, the areas can be applied to a edge of the filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones above and therefore clearly avoided in faces, believers and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the harmlesstograph filter. the original image is the (1) and this picture has been applied (2). the original image has been applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The image Editing; Tool Refokus is focusing on image by improving the sharpness. it was used by copyright protected air-irritation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to reverse a picture & quot; refocussed quot; in which there is a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. this is easily better to sharpening images. help can start better results than skillation. you can proceed from the menu by launching colors on image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circuit works much better than the palate's folding. the Gauß 'sche has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical results, which is widely affected by the original quellartes, which will result in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. the causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular shape. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures you should set a higher value if your image should be very inotable, but if your image should be very inotable.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected by 0-1. values are from 1, and eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation does not reduce the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the room filter can assume you to reduce evil factors. however, values can be reduced by 0-1. however, values can be low as 0.1 only rarely. if the noise is very bad. a value of value is 0,03. a high value is still further polluted by the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß 's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß' sche. this is most frequently used to avoid this value to 0. in most cases, you should use this value to 0, so you might have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizenith: this value determines the size of transformation format. an increase of the transformation size can be set good results, especially if you select big values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any item-focused parameters will be stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all supplements, color and intensity dots on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture anywhere else. the reason for this is that much operations which are not instantly visible, but later disagreeable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should use the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, Unsharp Maskine produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by means of indulting a larger neighborhood used for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to create evil measles. even under optimal conditions, it can never be the effect of the inspiring filter. for the Viennese filter it is always at least as good as the nonfermentation mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better at the editing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small, focused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this image has been made using a analog camera. the unfocussed result is attributable to the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the focus on the focus of digital pictures, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator in the regulator apprelies the inspiring of the area which was obscured for a naturally pure puppy.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows an adapted color for the pupil. in case you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non-desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Indian algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes several presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the currently available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the Reiter and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed instructions p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a smooth Glacier above the picture. what a value of 0.9 should be respected for details. please note that no sharpening should be necessary. please note that the details can always be mapped in detail.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. you will create a high-wave pattern. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated for a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then define the relative glacification. thus, set this value matching the level of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter applies to bigger structures. the higher value is required, the more is more smooth, as it is hard to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulent effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: on how often the algorithm is run through. usually 1 or 2 can be enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Variable stripping width since [5, 90]: first-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is very small, then ensure that small angle can produce a long running time. thus, you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrating stride width [0,1, 10]: integrated pedaling range in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: this more on quality you can get by choosing this option is only low. but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save and store exactly this. each setting of image errors can be correct and reloaded later in a text file.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors can be comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and take a high CPU load. this allows you to break the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see such image errors with little artifacts. the module is shown on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera which is made in Guatemala City with a bad film storage during the trip was made (1) to see and corrected the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digging; diamond-induction is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool allows selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair from the lens. it can also be used to remove senses from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on the digital cameras from digital cameras, so you can read them in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a gradient crawler that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow of advanced settings may remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) up to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter per pixel and can be spoiled for the filter per pixel. the image is slipped over the image and colour in it is glittering and thus smaller faults adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Focus: controls the sharpening level. this value sets the pixel pitch shifting. if it is raised to adjust the edges of the filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot receive, noise or lubricating.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response. if it is too strong, you can not remove all the noise if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the brightness of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to change an image. these settings influence the glittering process of the images controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerances of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings influence the glittering process of the images controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker ranges, but typically consumes the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of phasenjitterabsorb. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, noise and phasenjitter can occur at the edges. he may remove robbery and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are being used for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have placed can be stored in the file system and later charged.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and it corrected (2) and it was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a bit soft to sharpening, is fortunately much easier than a picture to draw out, and experiment with the gluten. this makes the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restauration is definitely one of the most advanced tools for photographing photo files.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for the restauration gives you the possibility to emerge a lot of unwanted artifacts, film varnish, scratches, compression-file and local errors that makes the images taken along the image contours and thus obtain the content such as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the texture is performed with another tool, the image correction is performed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannuts and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">To reduce JPEG Artefacts: compression by JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it is even very far away. as a loseworthy compression & quot; Artefacts & quot; - small standards which are to correct the uncompressed image. this setting can correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save and store exactly this. every setting of photo restauration can be stored and reloaded later in a text file.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restauration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and take a high CPU load. this allows you to break the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">At the bottom, you can reduce the image of a photo with a layer of noise when using a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to a Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film gritt among the faces. the original image is under (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see a further example of the photo restauration. this time, Textures can reduce on an old color photo, which causes the scan artifacts and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and corrected the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The Hotpixel's & digikam; Tools Hotpixel are allowed to remove images from photos that are used with a CCD camera, which are using algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem, because many cameras have a built-in repression of hot pixels using JPEG compression.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image contraction method. there is no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool becomes automatic and brighter pixels. these are highlighted in the image show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to take you the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the right dark image to correct image. an automatic processing of the dark image will be found to see the last dark picture and recharges this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview can help you correct the image. the forester indicates the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixel are emphasized in all outside areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filters.</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirteen: an average of the neighbour is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels which have a distance of 1 pixel pitch, comes to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or are used to interpolishing the defective pix in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Quadratic: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a spacing of 2 or less to calculate, a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) is then used to interpolishing the pix in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a spacing of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic meters (1-dim) to interpolishing the defective pix in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">At the bottom, you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposing, showing the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digicam; Vignesetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetops, that is to correct the corners.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, in particular, in the middle and large photo format, can't even illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the light the sensor there. telephoto lenses also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it has also drawbacks. many Center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which is impossible to hold the necessary sealing time, even with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise imfering effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure areas of today's filters and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerless and simulates the transformation with a Centerpoint on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three reglers, you can control the right-release filter correction and with three further exposing of the target pictures.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the level of light beam at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, or randomly adjust the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignets to compensate it to compensate it to a small degrees.</seg>
<seg id="572">Illumination, Contrast and Gamma Settings: the editing with the correction of the Pixel. you need to adjust the exposing of the target pictures with these options. the knob adjusts you only positive values as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want an enemy readjustment of the purposes, you let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma to zero and use the gradation of the & digikam; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignesetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the corrected picture in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminaire and contrasting correction was also carried out with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digging; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool runs with geometric distortions. color corps cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree contains the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar monitoring effect, but flattened on the edges. this bug is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth part corrects the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two geometric distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tonnenary dezeres can be corrected and positive values are crushed into distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger in edges as in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the parameter parameter has the reversal signs of the parameter of parameters.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the picture size and thereby conducts a correction of the first degree. negative values increase to positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated in the dialog with a preview the error correction. the values you are using for your picture will be stored and used for the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnaire resp. coronical correction should be carried out in front of all aggregates or size changes. if you perform a picture and then carry out a tonnenical correction would be the effect to be ready.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to find you this tool a vertical and a horizontal relieving line. move it on an important place, like e.g. the seabed or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. afterwards, you can correct the tonnaire / copular distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you are correcting a verified frame, the resulting picture of black ends is generated by the dot-tool in the menu, cut the images from the picture processing or via the zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the tonnenical correction from. the next logical step for some motifs, such as photos from the front, frame and paintings, it is like to correct the brightness in the picture of 90 degrees. NOTE that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnenical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and corrected the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see the URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window, you can preview the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below allows you to simulate two parameters of film pieces and film-sensitivity (ISO). the ISO knob allows you to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film material and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filters are used to produce red infrared film, especially the kale leaves makes it not sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, since the color formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film maker, applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is set at (1) and this image (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digicam; Filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film licenses on your images, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitivity of the films by making the manufacturer large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grains effect gives you a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grained look especially in your monochrome photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated for control of the intensity and granularity of the grains. although more commonly higher values are needed, if you need more grains, you can turn the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-gradation on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and this was the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>

<seg id="600">The sdigikam; Filter Oil paintings gives its digital images a nice appearance like an oil paintings. natural pictures and stylistic live are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two control knob to influence this effect. the upper chooses the pin-size between one and five. thicker brush are superior to big images. smooth or, from the other side view, hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the paper is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and glued 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digicam; filter coal assign use color and intensity gradient to create a carbon roller. it is useful when you imagine the Umrisse in drawing are not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you have chosen to sketch you. this would have good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob elects the pin-size and the lower adjust the contrast (Glam).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the high performance filter. the original image (1) and the changed picture (2). the result settings are 30 and 10. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digicam; filter engraving has marked your picture in 3-D as if it was used in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digicam; filter engraving is a fast tool for giving your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works very well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important at the content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the picture into a gray, monastic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, is equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving Filtration. the original (1) and the processed depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art via transplant effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelength 1: divides the image in cells, and it will look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wavelength 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 is distorted to the image here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of artwork through imfermentation effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharp: spenches the image along star shaped lines that exploited from a centre. this simulates the inspiring camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often reflected in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unity: spenches the image by rotating the pixels at a focus. this simulates the inspiratory action of a shifting camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removing grips: pamper the picture to generate the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion inspiring: spill the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the inspiracies of a linear moving, z: b: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">The picture gets softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütteler: spenches the image by random shifting of pixels and simulates the inspiratory tract of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unity: finds the colourants in the picture and overexploited this without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and then create, thanks to the filling with a mean pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. this calculation can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentrop are a nice small tool for making headdrops on your image. this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a modified figure by Pieter Voloshyn urcopyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Tropfencode allows to change the size of the drop-down. since the drop-size does not automatically increase the size and density of drops. amount changes the quantity and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image processing with a range free of control drops, e.g. a vision that should remain free of freely. if you want to run the filter, the area will remain free of control drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regulator. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the illustrated picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">When the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation. the tools can find tightening or transformation mirror in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo Bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo to enlarge in minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">Image to zoom out is easy. the great question is, how can you be able to find an image while the boundaries of the dissolution? how can you be found out or guess the cimg algorithm that is here a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If you have a photo the wrong size, you can change it on the desired size with the tool size. choose a transformation size in the menu and specify the target readings. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Use the tool for size using a linear interpolation method for changing the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge a image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">They must say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain the aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the introduction of the new size is the aspect ratio of the original image ratio.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter applies to bigger structures. the higher value is provided, the more is required if you want to produce a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect. even if you want to generate a' van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as well as loading are used exactly. each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo Bubbles is very quick when it makes it, but it can last very long and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">Below is shown below an example of photo bubbles by taking a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the larger image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cropping of a photos is not only a frequently executed operation, but also a often underestimated tool to create a picture, simply by pressing the mouse button, by pressing the mouse button. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you let the mouse button go out, the field of photos will be cut off. thus you can change a good overview like your photo after the cutting area. you can easily draw the size of the square by adding a new rectangle by clicking it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting button, use the button of the cutting button in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries for storing or save file in the menu to save the redirected photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the area, you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">Set the orientation for aspect ratio and specify the orientation as high-format or landscape format. in the portrait format, the larger value of the height and in the horizontal format is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to aspect ratio uses a lateral ratio, regardless of whether you're centimetres, inches or any other physical size. you can see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">On the right end of the Dialoges there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the Max. relations with the Max. ratio button to cut the area for cropping on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen size and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to aspect ratio save his settings depending on the image processing (horizontal or vertical), these settings are displayed as default in accordance with the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data will be reflected in the EXIF data, and not reflected the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of compassing aid can help to include assistance to make your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic arances are based on the principle of similarities. like the third the third triangles, a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles are aimed at the diagonal triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Middle: the golden middle is a division among different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it dives in all possible things that we can feel nice.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you was already used for the old Egyptians and Greeks. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you combine your pictures, buildings and even photographs to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is part of the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is the equal numbers after 1. the resulting part is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows is described as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle poses the smoother aid lines when you construct an image. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. in comparison to third party the Golden Spiral creates the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A rule, however, is the right corner of the golden spiral, even golden rectangles. this case can be used to produce the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this something can be simply because without having to guide the eye, it will accomplish its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangle shapes are also from the top mentioned Golden Spiral. NOTE that in contrast to the harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not comparable to these lines. diagonal of these lines may be a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use gold triangles to break your frame, you will create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to create your photo paper at one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal and vertical mirrors are used to mirror the harmonious splits.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button colour, you can set the color of help lines. in case you can see a picture of many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines may be visible. on this type you can customize the colour of the lines your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool for turning a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, then it's easy to fix the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this is created with the & digikam; image processing and the tool-free rotation. choose the transformation of free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this telescope is set in grade. with the knob adjustments you can set the slider on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">At your help the module's free rotation puts a horizontal and a vertical line. after you move it over an important point of image, you can affix it with a pressure to the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is the function transformation from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trimming the image is the function Automatic cutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after turning. but consider the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspektive transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is displayed in the center of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">In order to change the perspective, you must use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information which will help you to change your perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: shows the current angle in degrees on the top left of the transformulated area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees in the upper right corner of the transformulated area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angles left down: displays the current angle in degrees in the lower left corner of the transformulated area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees in the lower right corner of the transformulated area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjustment of perspective the picture gets a bit dirty. for a single adaptation is this effect small but two adjustments create a double as powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you will get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way this is the picture with transforming cropping from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">This tool is used to shift a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part in the opposite. this is no rotation, the image is distorted by other words, a rectangle turns into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformer.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shear your picture by using the horizontal corner and vertical corners. if you are able to press horizontal and vertical at the same time. a preview of the effects will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target range will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line triumph. move the mouse to an important point, like e.g. the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines, to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out, the image will be refreshed. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two deposits are generated twice as much solication and so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is the picture with transforming cropping from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages for image formats, so that they are available from your system and in some cases, from the kind as these libraries are compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam;</seg>

<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. in order to load a possible correlation to time and localization, you must load a trace file with GPX file, of course you have recorded data the same time at the same locations, like the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded a automatic correlation which displays the coordinates in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore, the camera time is converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. this time you can set up your camera time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting for the maximum deviation for the maximum time variance is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. the deviation of them will be merged. the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place for pictures, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used when you have no matching data. if you know that in reality, you can set this limits in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can correlate to interpolating the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog box will need to use the button OK to set the data at the current picture.</seg>
<seg id="819">The localization can also be found with the displayed card and continue. select the relevant region and enlarge it. the height must be picked up manually, until you can always be selected manually. the card can always be changed manually between card mode, satellite image and one mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to mount the GPS data to the images. here is a small script used to make a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can export the albums released as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will be UTF-8 encoding to make best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be customized. the rider choice allowed it to select to HTML. the albums are not allowed to select one large number of albums. in the area among them, you can quickly choose a large number of albums on the right-hand side and the text which will appear in the head of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defined the general look and layout for each image. this rider is largely created itself. if you click on a picture, this image will be shown on the picture, otherwise the image will be shown directly with your image viewer, and eg; Kuickshow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider record defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved to all your associated images. choose a folder from your desk. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLexport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth, you can change the standard color depth. the file size also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider models makes you some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails, which are small images shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user like far the action. press Abort to break the process.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer Module is a tool for converting a series of images into a mpeg video in the form of a diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to add selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert the packets of MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a base picture to the single images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled automatically for the selected video format. in addition, you can choose a background color for the Diaschau. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are packed into MPEG Diaschau, then you can create the module via the MPEG Diaschau module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed below image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. in case you can select the video format from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify a picture which is displayed in seconds. the speed of the picture process is defined below. a lower value generates very sudden, a high contrast of very smooth exchanges.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt, you should leave it black. the name and the path of the created file can be found under the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file in the audio source file, then this will be integrated into the film. after you can easily miss the generation of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a cup of coffee and enjoy the digreyfish if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, so you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printmaker allows you to print multiple images on a sheet paper. the combined photos can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is currently useful to improve or print with Gimp module for direct printout.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your in RAW format to one of three formats, TIFF, or PPM format.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original itat of Ihm is: expect from dcrab not that it will be the same results as the software from your camera product. sometimes you get better results with dcrab better results.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file that should be converted and start the module. the raw picture-konverter window appears in the mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the process process, if the first option decides to adjust the camera settings as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers. if the result is not optimal, you can process the picture later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrasting information. if your camera does not work in RGB mode, the RGBA switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are pleased with the preview, you can choose one of the three output file formats and the file name is equal, and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossable algorithm and produces the smallest file size.</seg>
<seg id="859">The full image format, TIFF, maintains all information of your image and uses lossfree LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you might want to process your pictures often or later, you should not use the JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality worsens. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata are stored in the RAW file in the EXIF data files.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion. if you want to cancel this process, you can use it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The launching domain Mode allows you to convert different images to one time. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by test to a single image that are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, you have the possibility of existing file automatically. this is helpful if this is not available in a previous attempt, but the progress indicator shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>

<seg id="867">This module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it is used to remove the image from the ImageMagick package. you can remove the image or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be selected automatically, depending on image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust printing resolution and size of photopapiers. the target size, including background size, edge-size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the added images before. more pictures can be collected to the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="873">After completing the module, you will add the pictures window with the selected photos. you can add more pictures from you to a file selection dialog. for the recently chosen image, you will see a preview of the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag the images to the image list and add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Using the button images, you will remove the selected pictures from the list of the sending pictures.</seg>

<seg id="881">After the election of comments in a specified file the comments will be joined and added to the text file into a text file.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the File Format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it should be best modified under the lossfree formats as such as TIFF. you should therefore not be changed if you want to change the photo quality. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in pictures file format, and the original files in JPEG format will be added, then the original file data will be added to the images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can view the status information, in search of errors, but your email program will be started automatically at the end. the button lets you close this window? EN.</seg>

<seg id="886">Option OpenGL runs in the presentation are using very elegant picture inputs via OpenGL. however, you need to own a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the diaschau will be very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename indicates that the name of the images can be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop will ensure that the presentation in a loop loop will be displayed. you can then break them manually with Esc;</seg>
<seg id="889">The option will randomly choose images shown in a random order. so it will not be the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">After delay between the pictures you can set the temporal distance between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds should correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, it should be out of your computer and the chosen transition effects. so you should be out to show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between them you can choose. randomly choose between the images and another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">While Diaschau you can access a tool bar at the upper left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch you in.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, stop the previous and the next picture and stop the slide.</seg>

<seg id="916">You can also select one area of the timeline by clicking the mouse button, so you can select the mouse over the ruler. if you select a range, you will hit the selection by clicking on a bar in the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& cphotoalbum; provides you two options available to create HTML web pages with your pictures; integrated in & cphotoalbum; integrated in & cphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create on the HTML's menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you'll need to make some settings. these are divided into three areas content, layout and target.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description which is supposed to contain the HTML file later. on cphotoalbum; HTML example page you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you choose whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the index page. ferry information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that the viewer can also be displayed without description. you can't use all pictures of a party. you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain beholder.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look clearly, so the most setup possibilities are clearly, so it is not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows you to display your website and display a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more pictures, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer from your site can change the resolution at any time. it can also change your pictures with low resolution, as well as to a lower speed limit, and if he wants to get a picture larger, it changes too much higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup range, place the various folder and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent kit.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the master folder, where all your pictures will be stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select a folder or a file supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if you've created them all for viewing the basins. if you have created for the base folder, a web browser will be launched, the URL you should be here. otherwise, the web browser should start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files are not yet installed in the final destination, you need to manually enter the definitive goal of files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base file in which all subfolders can be found.</seg>
<seg id="930">The recently described setup possibilities have changed all three to base folders or URLs. in this point, a subfolder is laid out, whose name will establish you in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the images. if you would like to create a HTML page to look at the images, recording, etc., you will need to make & stuphoto album; this work doesn't have to make this work even once.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & cphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your pictures in a .kim file. you can import and import other images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they can be stored whether the pictures itself is stored in the file. the advantage of all pictures can be stored in the file. the obvious drawback is, however, the file size is correct.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or create HTML pages, see, create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the pictures of a desperate fashion. first, the pictures of the URL, which are shown in the folder of .kim file. this is naturally only possible if you have created your .kim file through the HTML format.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is described in the following dialog for exporting pictures, which you can export via the File Export....</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is possible to act internal or external .kim files. there are the following three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">At option Manual, you will copy the images to the .kim file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy Automatically near the .kim file copy copied & cphotoalbum; the pictures automatically begins for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures already have been compressed using JPEG and don't want to compress the files. if you want to compress this, just select the Export file to compress.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you send your friends pictures, you may not send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would be very big here. here you can tell the size that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file, select & cphotoalbum; exporting the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant for importing is made up of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import them to import images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you think the category persons of the imported file personnel is called (if you are a dane) in this category for your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialog window which are to be imported to the import file and correspond to those categories in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can delete the categories of the import file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and watch: if you look at pictures, you would often want to see images within different image groups and see a picture with your friend looking, you might want to see all pictures, on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the steps below (1) to find the information on your pictures, through (2) the search and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and adaption possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">Kphotoalbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. but it was expanded and today it will take care of your videos. in many places this manual is talked about images, but frequently this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& cphotoalbum; stores all his information in the file index.xml in the uppermost file of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& cphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this in future start page. if you want to read another folder with images, you can start & cphotoalbum; with the option -c. for example: cphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Read about the menu entry settings cphotoalbum; enter a window with which you can change the settings of & cphotoalbum; in the following section of user manual you will discuss the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call setup possibilities and the options for viewing the viewer you can call through a button to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you as you can specify various properties, e.g. individuals, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On view the dialog box, it is used to work already existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a labeling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set complete assembly groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of an enterprise as stated in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the list options, you can choose to specify the list of members. in the left window, you can configure the category. in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& cphotoalbum; share his module system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. ferry information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules. the modules can not be described in this manual, because they are not part of & cphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page which can be accessed via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together with multiple applications, so you can test the modules with the command line; so you can use new modules with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userlap\ &gt; or via the command Help. don't tell you, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications which are using KIPI together are very different, so it can be that some modules with & cphotoalbum are not working. this is the drawback when you share features with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & cphotoalbum; and other applications which can also use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported by albums. even if & cphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, simulates the order to albums, so you can use the functions with & cphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">With it simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which corresponds to the current viewpoint, so all pictures, which shows you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album must be & cphotoalbum; the modules also has a list of albums. here's a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browsing the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used the category, which you have chosen in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums, for example, if you have to use a photo album, so if you have chosen to view the view and give it to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & cphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove these from the list of the modules. launch the settings dialog, and select the modules that are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start & cphotoalbum; start your own image.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are familiar with any other KDE application, you will see all of the menu bar and a toolbar. in this section, you will not see the window with which you can't see your image database, now click on this window, now click on the entry images, which shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & cphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with comments on the picture, where the image is recorded or click any remarks or for a larger number of images, if shown on all pictures Jesper and all pictures in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for search and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by taking persons, places and keyword. these are a very important part of & cphotoalbum; because you're still using it again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the move to pictures inside the list: if you have a family celebration, and on all 50 images, you can see the same 5-10 persons can be postponed that the persons used to be moved faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer an illiterate list, click on the icon for sorting after date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected remarks for each image, you might want to edit all the selected pictures, and click on the images with notes. please click on the front and back buttons, which are under the picture of the picture on the top.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. besides San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overlap. to show you that it is a special symbol displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context of context of the feature films it is possible to add one entry to an existing or new or Subcategory. additionally, you can also make an entry to a category. attention, this is predicting that you've just sorted your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the feature films by forming the edge of the frames, click and move the upper edge of frames. you can also make an own window by taking it outside of the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">When you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs, click on the button options... which offers you the possibility to store the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also set out a frame. if you want to see this window later again, use the button options... and here then a window to fading. this process can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will get an overview of the current pictures, or all images in case you have no filter. for example, you can configure the size of the thumbnail when easy to configure the mouse with the middle button. try it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you place a picture in the background of your desktop, this image will be set as a background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is not displayed in image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate images from you and press either the Remove button or select the Edit menu. now you will see the window which you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& cphotoalbum; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the photos stored on the hard disk. of course you need to record the images anywhere in the database. in the image, you need to see the image of & cphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, with which the right corner is cut off, are not saved on the hard disk. for example 5-9, however, the pictures are available, so & cphotoalbum; but you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this function you need to copy files from the folders and want to copy again. if you want to avoid the record of your pictures, so you can avoid any major hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu please click on a submenu with the name of privacy. if you would like to have a little more privacy, you can also lock the images that you can see for others, you can also control your small sister, you can lock and choose the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have set out what pictures should be hidden in the case of the Falles, just select the menu entry images, allowing all images that you are blocked off. if you want to get out the images again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password to unlock the images to unlock the pictures. to view this password, select your password in the menu Privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this photo protection is very safe. you can read or delete all images on the hard drive and to the others it can only read out or delete the password. this type of password protection is intended to be released on the file index.xml; not very familiar, that are with & cphotoalbum; not very familiar, to pass to private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your pictures with & cphotoalbum; manage and read about hours so you want to look at some time. from this reason it has a picture _ and video viewer. this can be seen from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer you can see. it shows the picture, but additional information you can enter over the picture, like who is done on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">In case you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image, you can also configure the mouse and what else you can see. all these options may be displayed on the viewer. all these options may be shown below by a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you are here, the browser, see, matching entries will be shown here. if you're talking to Anne Helene, the browser features all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you chose Anne Helene and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple pictures in the viewer you can get back to them and get back, by using the keys image high and the end. you can reach the first and last picture with possession of Pos1 and the end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded into consideration, you can run this as diaschau. and then you can run a new picture after a few seconds. like frequently it can be controlled by pressing Ctrl key and plus or Minus. start and stopped by pressing Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the beholder of & cphotoalbum; is it in full screen mode. in this mode the viewer simply uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch back in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can use it in the image and extract it out. with the Minus key, you can zoom out again. with the Minus key, you can zoom out back up the image of the image. shows how a Zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of ZOOMS.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomt displayed. using the liction paste the ZOOMS is so that every pixel corresponding to the screen of a pixel image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">NOTE that the only zoomoperations work with videos that are in-fold with the Plus- and Minoustics.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotary functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this will not work with videos. you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item comments from the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you can see pictures, you can take a picture of a person whose name you will have to see on the image. in the moment you can open the image and make configuration settings of the picture, but you will perhaps draw the image to mark and see further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see images on paper. you can start looking at the pictures, while you can select it as well or badly, while you watch one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, you will give you the opportunity to watch images with a feature while you see them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you can see the corresponding letter. in view, you can see an image where features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, you will be able to edit it in your browser. you can also download all pictures you want, print or whatever you have chosen, so you can copy one module to copy the selected images on a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in the view view. if you have categories in your view view, then you can add features to the images by clicking the letters for the feature, after the image is selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case you will allow you to paint the photo album; on the painting.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted is not saved with the image, but in the database. on the way you can reverse your old later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In fact, you can see a picture on the painted side. to finish the painting of & cphotoalbum; click on the painting from the text menu. to finish the painting you just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you must have the application of the program & Povray; do not have fully paid but the documentation of & Povray; should you be read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can choose single objects. then the object features displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wired screens yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To add a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are various positions, the following menu will be blinded to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene, either from the menu bar, or from the menu bar, or from the menu bar.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have any properties changed, click Apply to apply these changes. then you have invalid values will be displayed, and then click on any request or cancel the changes with breaking.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; enter the documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the Povray; reference for the displayed object.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 does the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the community view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the self-shared display and a small example of the scene is associated with the chosen text box, even if you want to have a subordinate item (for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The image shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse and change the position and the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the centre for shifting and turning the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a vision model as a wire model. you can only specify this value relative to the visibility of objects or as an absolute value. Objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility to select the selected visibility of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window rules or if you need a different arrangement, you can save them as desired. you can also change multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">In order to anchoring a window or under a present view, drag the start to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, draw the early water or left side of a view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange several views in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map charts upstairs in the viewpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window assignment are pageviews: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring area or click on the small to the left-up arrow in the beginnings.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the early asserbar. to prevent slips, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu View, you will find entries for any type of views. new views are pending you can anchored at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view... save the window order... save a dialog in which you can save the window order under a existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">When you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g of rendering this program, was & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering symbol button in the toolbar or select the menu entry view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode equivalent to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. he will define the image size and quality of the rendering. if you are using a scene in different images and quality levels, you may be able to preview many Render modes, from a quick preview up to full pictures of highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the Settings icon in the toolbar or select menu View of Render modes, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but is meaningful but a name that can recognize the characteristics of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the cardboard box size you can only bear the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to take a small part of the image, select the cross section subsection and give the image detail to the rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1041">On the drop-down quality you can select the properties that uses & Povray; this is from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user's guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is made with only a beam each pixel, there may be different errors. these images have often not displayed a Moirè pattern or increment effects in curves and lines, besides that they are sometimes smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliases.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technology called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, pictures with this feature is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on Anti-Aliasing, calculates & Povray; more than one beam ever. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as default, adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is better split, because each pixel will be divided and adaptive because the recurring depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray automatically proceeds to the default threshold of pixels with super-sampling, then if you adjust the default value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated if you want to add a grid value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. when the difference is shared between the values given the given threshold, then the pixel will be checked in 4 lower pixel and the maximum depth of the recursion allows you to adjust the depth of the scale.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the production of robing for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays leads to a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The latest setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse reflection flexion. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map chart you can set if the alpha channels are calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, when the associated beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Open a new window to display the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly expired, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import one & Povray image, select the menu entry file... and select a file in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler currently supports the complete command set of & Povray; if when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog for list of messages can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for & Povray; to import the source text file in the editor to import objects into the scene, select the source code in the editor, and drag it in the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler is called a scene. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the Help menu, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. place the path to your document and version. it supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; Search for external files (for example difference data) in the paths to the & Povray; if you enter files, you must also enter the path to these files here. if one file is used in different paths of the library, the first published file is used.</seg>

<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera-view and in the window type labels.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object-catching of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model. you can set the grid for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore a better proximity to the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball can be separately adjustable for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross large detail stalls for extended projections, all wixt screens are further subdivided, if the camera requires an extended projection. extended projections are all projections for projections, but require more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is crossed. the wall will be displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross floor, a bottom is placed below the objects. the bottom is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick bout of edges, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for the Rendering of scenes. values for depth and threshold value allows you to adjust. accurate data to the parameters in the section of Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window request, it is declared how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down Standard Window System: displays all of the existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window assignment in the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list Add existing windows. a new setup allows you to add a new arrangement with the button and removing a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window disorder is identified by the name. the name must be clearly and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen window assignment. new views can add you to the button and remove selected views of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The new window. with new column, you can create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with file card you receive a flashcard view, along with the previous view and the view not in the main window, but also generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start any more specific knowledge of both programs. if you are able to create the ultimate but simple scene, you should very popular among them: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warning carefully before you complain about it as a result. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set the camera, you cannot be applied to the Rendering as a result you will receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you insert no light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you will get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything wrong, you will see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset constructions are:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object. Mark the scene and then select the menu entry Edit. now you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera is considered the whole scene you can produce. in particular, the view of the scene from the camera's point of view. this is showing you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains a new entry with the name camera. when it click on it, you will find the content of the view characteristics which can be found in the different parameters of the camera. in the user documentation of & Povray; find out more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, but this is more instructions to change, but consider the camera in view control points, with which you can change the focus of the camera. simply click on the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button 1 or press the button, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately in accordance with these settings. as a result they see here the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene. you could insert a squader (inserting the fader) and the size at x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a decent method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and press the button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also displays the level as well as at the moment only as limited scale level. if you render the scene, the level extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you are looking to the object tree, you will notice that you will find the default options for each new object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, also change the possible settings in view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the ground into exercise under the horizon line so you can make some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the ground in order to introduce its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose some different materials at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue will be displayed in which you can select how the object is to be inserted into the object tree. you can preview the name in the property tab. you can preview the name in the property tab. view the pigment as the pigment is now looking forward.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments only shows a matt black material, because you need adjusting the pigment of materials at any time with one click on preview. give it a lot of ways to preview the pigment. but there are also many ways to get the piglets you get the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">When you look no color on quader and ball, click the button to apply and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now correct. if you rendering your image now with a click on the icon, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this does not have the color. you need to enter two new attributes. then you can also enter this entry twice (you can also often do more often but the chess board color list can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select the colors of any color and change the colors in the view characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you just be able to perform, because you should have understood the fundamental procedure of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball as just as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. place the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget the ball contact or button tap), so that the ball would floating above the ground as you have shifted the ground around a unit.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering results in now a strange results: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put the following step into a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">When you have selected the ball, you can assign a material now. like at the bottom, the ball will give a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select Rear Project and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball pigment, then select button and put the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects when you take time, see some metallic features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screens you click on or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of radiance effect and reflection shows some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal tables: even if metal is not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of which offers you & kpovmodeler; I hope you already have so much learned that you can create simple, but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you installs a scene of raytracen, the rendering of the operator (i.e. from the camera, which are calculated from the perspective) by any pixels in the scene. the Render is calculated and how atmospheric effects appear like fog as such as fog. so the scene is processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing to see the camera without a camera. without a light source you see also nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, each scene is to be ridified, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the Standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have to have created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model, added the file into this menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved this model, it will be saved under the same name. is it a new file, you need to enter a name and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene represents the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last saving will be rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry if you have not yet stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command. this menu entry allows you to select, if you are using editing.</seg>

<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for the setting of & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the appearance, the key cuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Open a dialog for changing the shortcuts. you can change this option default commands for & kpovmodeler; change orders or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog for setting up the toolbars. you can add and remove these tools by toolkit for & kpovmodeler; -commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to pair rough surfaces, without any berries on the surface single models. and without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump card as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of these plots. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object colour to pixel base, by applying a image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuchshow; is a convenient image viewer and browsers. the application features a file access where you can select images for display.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, you can exchange your scripts data with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use command dcop; which should be bending after each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts would enable the execute external programs and commands. in this way, the exec function is usually called dcop &gt; relatively simply called. here an example in Python:</seg>

<seg id="1390">If you enter the keywords OR to enter, it will be selected according to entries, which may be either the one or the other search term. example: one OR TWO OR three. in this example, all pieces are found, one or two or three (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries, then include the word mark, then connect the keyword with goose quets: Mike Oldfield. this will contain according to entries, but Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a certain search path, you can also search for bigger or small. for example: review: &gt; 50th This is looking for pieces that have a higher average rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you would like to search for a certain search term, you will find a minus sign in front of search term: -something goes into pieces which are not included.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these synthesis variants according to each other. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bath. this is looking for all pieces that have either Mike Oldfield, or have a higher average rating than 50 and not included the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the capture sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then click on the right button on the entries. the entries will then be given with a number. Number is the number one of the sequence to be played in which the pieces will be played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar tool bar is located at the bottom edge of the window. you can add buttons to some functions of the playlist. on the left you will find the playlist, you will find playlist, playlist and recurize mixing.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kde; is also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; you can use the command line utility dcop, or something more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functional scope, so that's more your taste and the type of your task is decisive, which can give you the back programs.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line utility dcop. you must make sure that & K3b, you must make sure that & K3b is started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Apart from the general & DCOP; -functions that have all & kde program are supported, supports & K3b; mainly two more parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & K3b; provides functions like copyCD, format DVD, and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-method, one receives a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then an reference to the project by using # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject. by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the up to K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString Name) void createFolder (QString Parent) void addurl (QString Parent) void addveItem (QString path) void rename Item (QString path, QString newName) void setVolumeID (QString)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and will then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder duo dcop $PROJECT addurl / home / trueg / marfile.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1498">For the first step, the read out of & CD;, is compiled by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled packet; if this is not installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3) must be installed (for MP3), OggVorbis (for OGG) or other codings. all these programs are not necessary for any Linux distributions, but it's not necessary to compensate anything itself. if for example FLAC is not necessary, it is also not necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter covers audio quality, body and compression ratios and helps you choose the right body code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio files are to be lost, a lossfree audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' Monkey 'which may be used for this distribution. the disadvantages are the small compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information via data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG files are the most frequent bitrate for lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but more than this bitrate are less important, because both Kodiers will produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is provided with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High up to very high quality quality (with high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality for deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing ogg players is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - support these devices mostly support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most musiciles acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and fewer complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11th 128 kbps for all pieces of young people, portable devices and autostereoids. but not good enough for better hi-fi systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely have the absolutely highest quality without consideration to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that manually enter or through the program will be collected from FreeDb via the internet, are available in the program available as a list of parameters. you can transfer / needed to create the folder and file name as well as the code of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms, there are often a combination of program settings for the body and these parameters. the manual or the help to the code readers explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; Title to the jailwords (English: day) to add MP3s with lame must be added to lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button of a button in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">It is what the FreeDb is: a free database to read and enter the information you can enter into the computer, so that all other of the information can be downloaded from oneself in the calculator. it is written here only by text; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm. of the book) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent the public on the & CD; more or less worthless, so the artist may not be added directly to the music business. all information can also be used with a & CD; shop, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a crossfield (sending a address). in this type of configuration, it seems to be used with another (fake) address of the retrieval of the data from the server (This can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries the main database are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator is used, the geographically below mirror server is to use. this saves bandwidth on the network and resembles the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org offers a current list of reflections on the online call for & CD; information during read out a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What program is used to store pieces from the & CD; save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that it doesn't want to know, search in the source code.... It was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package must be installed first from the right distribution first, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the saved WAV files, the codierer and thus select the desired file format will be selected. during the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio files) on the setup card can be added to the register map itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coater package must be installed by the Linux distribution which can be used before the code can be used. further information on Kodierer is also displayed in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, you can obtain further information on its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). the name must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">That can have many causes. to check out the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read-code your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not be successful!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step for example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood anyway? well, no problem, follow this step-for example, and you will get enough information to configure those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, setup and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable Bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 sample words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to it (eg; by trying to copy some inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic inclusion of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each registration & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here, we determine the possibility of using music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps) and what structure is used to use the program running FreeDb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings, we will probably not change them at any output of a & CD; change when the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The specifications name will pass on the program program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working, even if more than a & CD drive can be provided, the effective specifications of your drive can also be attached to the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to handle the device's existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map General Settings. there's not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be as busy / emboated as illustrated in the screens.</seg>
<seg id="1554">For incomplete information please consult, so you will be informed if data are missing from keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and allow the & CD; data automatically download the Internet from a FreeDb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">NOTE: the computer must be connected to the read of the & CD; connect to the Internet to access the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection process is easier, a & CD; entry is found right when you can easily change the directory name / filenames or tag entries, they can easily change easily. the directory or name will be easily modified and the ID3 tags can be changed with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, you will need to be able to check if you want to enter the drop-down mode if you want to use the database before. however, this must be worthwhile using FreeDb in the offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first mode has to be set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is FreeDb for us. these are settings for the data on request, for call from the FreeDb server about the Internet. as white the system that data is to get the CD? read the section via FreeDb. see everything as shown in the screen image.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, but we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page Freedb.org and look into a mirror server nearby. on this road the load is distributed between the computers. however, this setting can work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work even equivalent to the server, as many firewalls will boiling the protocol 8880 as standard, there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to transmit any & CD; data to FreeDb Server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp on your PC exists)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously permissible pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one of the existing drive? paralleles reading and encode? the author does not make it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; following the read out of the last piece: cross this to the & CD; cast out at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you want to cross this, then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored in which the WAV files can't be enabled, if you don't want to make the files in the private folder, if you don't want to make this folder some files with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything that is just as it is on the screenshot. the command is something long, under circumstances, something that may be blinded to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. like previously mentioned, the resulting bit rate is sufficient for very good HiFi stereo plants. the resulting bit rate is 6.3 and 256 kpbs. the resulting compression is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">NOTE the record "--id3v1-only 'for the restriction of the Tags to version V1 / V1.1.' ID3v2 'tags can also be deleted. in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the input-file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this exemple:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to encode WAV files: at a DualCore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just completed the basic configuration of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as default for each ad of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, as the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder can be set up and set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up and the & CD; data from the FreeDb is to be set up and has to be repeated for each registration & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD; do not use the image files in FreeDb, see the screen shots a bit different from the same for one & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; so you will manually get the files to pick it up from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the exact copy of this script. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD player has to be defined in the main window, in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a brief moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen image. this only if the & CD; identified as audio CD; identifies and can be read from cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then check the following Questions and Answers after the Help or go back to the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: when the & CD; successful from FreeDb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the title of the artist and the albums are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case, there will be more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there's a window tends, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion fits to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for automatic shut down from FreeDb (on the side & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also manually configure the first button in the toolbar. if you do not need local database, but need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - entering CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Insert the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen image, enter the title of the piece in the first line of the 'actuator title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Current title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary field can be used for single comments invalidated per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments, together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of data from FreeDb, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to test the contents of the CD-editor (e.g. if all words with big letters start or not...), but also to verify whether there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">NOTE: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album, and title of a piece and at only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you are limited to the video tab, you will have a look at the tab of KodiererSettings; have a look inside the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files later, with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 Tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coaches or file formats. see the help of the Kodierer to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry which is obviously untuned with the style of the sent CD; for example, this is not important as we read the & CD; and read the information on freedb.org and read information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available at Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor appears and you will see that the fields for the album is already filled with the given data, which we recommend for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the current form. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way up to you all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear when you have downloaded the data from FreeDb. it is sorted in one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. notice that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">NOTE that it has a check-in prior to each line of a piece. only the titles be selected so marked out. a simple click on the screen will choose the selection of all pieces directly at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selecting the read process, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then will we take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click the tab orders to switch on the order window. it is placed in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard drive. the program's status will be displayed in the lower left section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message allows you to work with a coater you have not installed. pieces which have not been successfully encoded, with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target audience are not what we've got here in the example. do you checked if you have a write access to the temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it's clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished, but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and code in parallel. notice the status indicator in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to press this behaviour. the only one that seems to read and encode. for high-weak machines, the result is unclear. the used machine with a AMD64 does not seem to have a problem in simultaneous read and cod (of course two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is coded and a third order is encoded, after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is inserted in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you will need & kde; 3.x. and 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the coding of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; however, if you get to CVS as part of the kdemultimedia package. if you are already familiar with CVS, you can get a pre-compiled copy of your distribution. if you read this, you probably have done it already...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people who compile the source files, and not intended for users who use the precompiled packet of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program you meet your needs if it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program running many different other programs, has many variants of settings. the best read the step for step example to know the options and settings. it shows screenshot of the various maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still click on read yet? even if only the Help menu was clicked with any starting point as it is going on from this somewhat empty screen (above all, if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusual short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this, probably the program has already started. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately not an e-mail. the author can't maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; and who will always be something usefulding or change it. at least, if you read this, it has also agreed to this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP drivers and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu, select the usual file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also find a file from a & konqueror, window to the & kmid window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and keep the button Abort in the toolbar, select the entry to play out of the menu piece or put the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it on the & kmid; window. (in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played afterwards.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece playing, you can jump to any spot by using the middle button and drive on the knob and drive on.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow, you can change the arrows to the left and on the right hand speed. to get the speed of the speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: if a piece is played, causes a pressure on the space bar, or selecting the menu button in the menu. thus breaking the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; Playing.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use Texterrifi, others use Liedtexternal event and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set up which events should be shown and even better: the erection type is automatically detects that you have been selected manually, so you will be able to change your karaoke text automatically, but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to adjust a erection type, select from the menu adjustments the entries Texterrestrictions and song ideas. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are listed in the series. in this section, how you can easily manage collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the collection manager. click here to organise the collection below the point.... Click New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the required habits in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to no other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be stored. concerns this if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song to the button. it appears in turn to the file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on adjustment Automatically adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic addition to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (when using file or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add a collection to the collection, a piece of the temporary collection will be activated and upgraded to this collection. the collection will continue to be upgraded.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to select the collection manager, select the collection and then click on.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played, if you select the series from the menu down menu of the menu, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or random order in the menu, the order will be defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, choose it in the collection manager, or use the selection above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button Next song, next song from the menu or press the button arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To skip a song back to the reverse, select the button's previous piece, the entry is a previous piece from the menu or press the key arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be deleted. however, they don't play as they are stored by & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events will be used in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-Map which converts any events of the Type Change patch to Bright Piano in Events of the Type Change patch to Trumpet, which was always a trumpet, if originally a piano one should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps. thus, you need to edit the corresponding file of your hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that saves all required settings for playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may often appear as desired. but it is, that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... END define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that it is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as e-mail, that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches are shown as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the mark is ignored. it is assumed that GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and do not leave the order for any of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to take all sounds that use this instrument with the number M. if your keyboard are not supported for example (e.g. with sound 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun shot. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI-file is playing a note with patch 127 (rifle), it accepts patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the term drum patch is meant to be with that of any sound, another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;), and not that of the sound the sound of the same drum means (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As the PATCHMAP section is the order of rows very important, as well as presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form notes on the percusp channel. see example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you wish to destroy the first and second channel, you simply do it at CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following specimen:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be used for this channel. if you're using the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored to change the patch on that channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for pitch ratio can be multiplied in which ratio of Pitch-Bender will be multiplied with the value n, this is converted to the formula 1 * (r / 4096), and then it is used until the map file is not used, thus, in the map file no decimalcomism.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM indicates that a pitch, that's a Pitch-Bender event will be played with the value 4096, one tone above. unfortunately, but try some keyboards up to one octave to play on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of Klais (one for each MIDI channel). see these actatures, which sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have a tool to change, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the played sounds. see the menu Settings under the Point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the larger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down the pace, use the arrows turn left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about it, like a music piece has to be played, so it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices into very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can not use anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file requires app. 50 KB, while a mp3-file requires a similar sound quality. during a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed and etc, you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; have this happened, because & kmid; without AWE support you need to download and install the redistribution (for example of kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no pleasure to add all files.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Do agree, this is supporting & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In previous step, you will be able to add automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can make the arrow button from Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; -working area a & conqueror; window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this way I have to play if the collection is playing at the end or I want to play a file, or change the file into the window of & kmid; move the file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen quickly a file, without them directly add to a collection, turn off automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI Files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. and first do you want to play the first file. so, adjust the adjustment Automatically adding to the collection and then put it on this a MIDI-file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you make it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you so much! if I see these songs or see the postcard, animated me that on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I'm not much free time at the University of Maacute; but I try to take a bit of time for my hobbies. when hobbies I have program to collect MIDI files, music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you can download MIDI / Karaoke files you can also download one error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me huge pleasant anticipation, if you send me a postcard from your place or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a MIDI file, but if you want to receive a MIDI file, you should get in contact with me, as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and judge no one in my spare time. I therefore want to make mention of it because when I get back messages from users (Postcards or E-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - Behind the error, that the pitch for AWE-cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also applies to Jose Lus Sanchez for the test of the GUS support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Dietheider, Ulrich Cordes and everyone, who sent me a patch, an error notifications or also only a supportive e-mail sent.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also applies to all these brilliant musicians in the net, which give us this wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, you can find & kmid; also found on its website, which is found under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarpink / kmid.html is. on the homepage you can see the development and look at links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you to use a sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality is much easier. it's not the same if you use FM radio or an AWE-card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card you have to compensate & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, then if you have any sound card, except you can hear no music.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the KDE site on new releases, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is formed from the so-called andocktically windows. there's always the window with the playlist. and finally there is a window window that will only display when information is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to drop the preferred connections under the bookmarks, but this is individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category continuous playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchical stage. if you click an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied into the current category and play with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only select the files in directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category. by clicking on a subgroup only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to be chosen from the menu and select either the processing mode or selected one other category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Following the convenience of the author's & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of running and loading can be disabled by editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 'if the option is not available, it can be simply added.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate other animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at Start does not need to be short, but it will be replaced automatically by opening a different source. this would be disturbed by the end-animation, the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be your favorite photos: & lt; & lt; Holg dur = "indefinite" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / if some examples of SMIL formats are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring the MPlayer Configuration dialog from & kmplayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here the edition of mplayer is evident.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this tasks in the configuration dialog from & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual loading of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, such as the setup of the backend per mimetype. here is an example of how a flash 'with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be used to validate the specific field Embed for YouTube in playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To return the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages must play the & kmplayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mime-Type, / x-Shockwave-flash in the alignment dialog file of the KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; comes in a console application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser window library. if there is no mistake, the backend output is inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the text menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">With this always a default port for a certain mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined by manual changing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc), for example, phonon must play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play by TV cards, either by using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). you need to use the use device and the TV channels. to this, the scanner can be used manually and edit the configuration file.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog in Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo is to be found out of which one is selected. the correct name must probably include a DVB to it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo, it should work as well (probably this type of recording of video equipment under Linux is the only one works). this is why the videoforlinux extension has to be functioning for the X server must therefore be in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally are used by SME for the sources different names. at the time of creating this documentation is this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, eclipse, piping, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start with the playback of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there references to do so I do my CDROM drive when I play from him (not from the VCD name: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is to result as user root after joining the device. it is absolutely sure to make sure that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine is only slowly getting up, why does my CPU become checked to their performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1760">With the automatic debursement of environments, for input of a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & kile; automatically set up an empty line (e.g.\\ end {command}). this feature can be disabled in volume settings; setup... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into few elements. & latex; encourage the subdivision of the document to the following elements (part is the longest and suband the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective point.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating its own & latex; files can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [odd file] has been created, jumps & kile; by a click with the central mouse button in DVI; viewer for the corresponding line in the latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; -Data reveals a description of the format document and other information as the font and is besides PDF the size of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, converting and to convert DVI; files for different systems and dishes.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the running surface, the elements of DVI; -File is clicked on a element in the DVI; file is clicked on the contrary section. once upon a section in & latex; source code is clicked, will be clicked on the respective point in DVI; -viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used for work with multiple files. with a Master document, the work with other incl.tex files is simplified. if using a project, a project master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quickset: the & latex; source code is compiled automatically and the result will be displayed automatically (unless a bug in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File storage: in this mode, the DVI; -file on the remote log will be called the date and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the freeway.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In consideration of editing the tool bar, the three groundrs must be found for the quick setup of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The recalright & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection panel More is for use of articles such as keywords, footnotes, or reference. the necessary measures are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name is designed for a section, a picture or different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Regarding: is used for a reference to a specified number (selection for a selection panel).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection of literary entries is displayed. at & BibTeX; this only works if the file is going to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; and & BibTeX; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection panel with the name of the name is used for the laying of the font name. it can be set for the main text, the foot notes, etc. are defined: there are the following font description for placement:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; there are two selection options for creating a new document by selecting the document type and the legend of the document. 2. the document can be written by reason.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The clamps according to the command\\ Documentclass include the settings for the command. the font is fixed. the font is not to start at the beginning, can this also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has to be entered, the latex must be compiled into source code. the easiest way to this is the use of the building of building or at the push of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compile. & kile; for storing the recording automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compiling of the document was missing, should be chosen according to the errors. when using quick removal, eyepiece should be automatically started. if this is not the case, the protocol should also be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (in English) is a text that is different from the residual document. is, for example, a report with the font name is provided. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ 'and\\ end {environment},\\, and\\ end {cultivated},\\, and\\ end {environment}</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the area (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment} up\\ end {environment}. there is no liability (number) for the disabilities within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to provide the readability and usability of the document. there are certain fonts, fat pressure, cursive printing, underlines, etc. it will end up either with the command\\, or automatically the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the solid pressure and is long as GÃ ¼ st, until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one set can be depicted using\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quots: creates a quote from document. the quotation starts with\\ begin {quots} and ends with\\ end {quotity}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After writing of the source in writing with the & latex; recording language, a step-step guide for the creation of a document in & kile follows;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once assistant was entered a bit text, some adaptances for the better readability of the document must be accomplished. a quote, some places in fat and cursive printing and a poem to be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor, or Ctrl-E editor. for an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and spaible.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a large file format (with D e V ice I nowhere). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some in the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF conversions or computer screen TVs.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI, the same steps as possible for creating the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, you can print out the document by file (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar encourages the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI, file from the & latex; source code, you can start converting in desired other formats using the knees in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">You would like to encourage the direct jump from the editor to dap in the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides an appropriate setting for all & latex; binaries to be setup. only Modern under the settings can be set up... Tools will be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to make the forehand search, the mouse pointer must be clicked on a line of the source in a line. the jump to the respective point in DVI; -viewer will be done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; one click on a button of the medium-button in DVI; -document the appropriate & latex; -document by & kile; and for this purpose, & quot; in & eyepiece; as a text editor are set (settings Eyepiece setup... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick removal of the & DVI splitter, you cannot imagine a bug, if a bug has to be submitted, this will be shown in the recording file respectively into the News window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The file logging file contains the error source in source. in the editor, the Knauf LaTeX-Error and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX-Error shall be used for spraying problems. to view the faulty line, must be clicked on the error in recording and & kile; jump to incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the respective button is clicked on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template for the document. preset fixtures are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can be written either from the ground or the assistant to create a new document. further information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Powerful user of & latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates can be stored in & kile; stored and loaded to make the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you have to create an existing & tex; - / latex; or create a new template, create a new template of an existing document and create a new template from document. create a new template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file, some string sets replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... settings General are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the template, it is necessary to know which string chains of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically they are used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and thus the use of the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way the following steps was executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can create your own template instead of default in the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. a simple way to create a template should be sought after one in the internet and the steps above described above.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& quot; used & Kate; as internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers and herence of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & BibTeX;). many settings for & Kate; can be made directly from & kile.</seg>

<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command-reference, which can be called for the quantity help LaTeX reference. you may be able to find a suitable description for almost all commands that can find in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with pressed Strg button to compensate the & tex; this means that by clicking on the\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par rounds orders.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When drawing the text with the left mouse button, the balanced text will be copied automatically to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with the pushed button, can be balanced to the source code in the editorbox.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; you can browse the different types of sources of sources and produce them. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are emphasized by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can be found in the text. this is an own kind of bookmarks within the text. the MenÃ ¼ rÃ ¼ rzel encourage the jump to the most or last diving mark. this jumps is also highlighted, so that it is automatically activated by the first input of a draw.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The working is probably one of the main aspiration during the use of a program such as & kile; even though & Kate; already excellent capabilities have been added in & kile; most important functions for the writing of a & latex; provide special commands for their selection. under construction are the following commands are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Orders a complete paragraph (group of lines, which contains on both sides a blank line). this extended meaning is not a text with all text codes, thus tables and all other lines of the source text. the only one-beading thing in & kile; is that the waste is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Orders the word in the current Cursor position. this command also has an extended meaning as this command also commands & latex; -commands covered with a repeat factory (\\) and an additional star (*) command.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For the building of a part of the document can be removed from this first, it will be removed by pressing the button Ctrl; K with which the whole line will be removed. & quot; with his own commands, the following commands are provided for the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">A complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description for working statements.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been suggests that environments a central role in & latex; play. therefore, & kile; for further orders under the surrounding area, for a good easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, in the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the outside.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, at the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the command to fly the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ begin {surroundings}, the end of the environment will be triggered (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">During the input of many committed environment commands, this command can be lost quickly. this command is harder and the last environment will not dispersed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special orders for the & latex; groups that are determined by staples {...}. under the TeX Group, some important commands are to match those of those work environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is used for the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the bored clamp.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adjust & quantaplus; to your needs, and how to help us & quantaplus; help can become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Documentation type Editierpakage (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; enables us to provide support for markup and scriptures; your simplicity and flexibility are from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developer, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are in two ways to include family 1, the brand languages and family 2, the script language and family 2, the script files and the tool box. day folders are handy, symbolic derivatives of captions (above the Editier window), the text and instructions can be quickly inserted into a document when a user could each.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details to convert.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create diXML files, then the & descriptionrc file; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Featuptrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a fast insertion of tags in a document without any danger of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing as a folder. you only contain the & descriptionrc file, and the tag XML files. tag folders carry the name of the writable language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declare whether they are necessary, or not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter covers each element in detail. everything about the capabilities and boundaries will be explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can contain only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains no-element type of itself nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; argument to function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid for the day class class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. returns the name of the class where this method is part of this method. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes inside this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describe an attribute of one tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. additionally, there will be more tags that describe such as this attribute will be, & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and methodology. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that combines the elements of a list. it can only occur in a list of attributes. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attributes shown in a dialog box. this day can only occur in a dialog only once for each attribute (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements available within the defined tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that finish a day. this item is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All diXML files need to start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly acquired and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but look out & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the diXML files, the tools dialog above is at the & quantaplus; window to start and check out TagXML. another dialog will be published, whose simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, checking only at charging the day XML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 diXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element of the & W3C; & XML; -scheme. the filename for this diXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, for a functioning family 2 diXML file. in this file it will be a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of the XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2026">A action can be fixed with setting actions. click on New Action to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyword associated with this promotion can be assigned. with clicking on button user you can be assigned a keyword, using Kone, the current key reduction can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be added a text in the detailed settings and inserted this text in the document to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually skripte, but it is not limited) which can change the document or as input (or parts of the document) or the various see in... promotions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to find the% scripting variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text will be used to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, a script input from & quantaplus can be assigned to the default entry. in the drop down input, it can be assigned to the default entry. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is normally useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, also the output of the run application can also be redirected. there are two types published; error messages can be specified to the standard version. it can be specified to which the default output is set to, by default the drop down output is set to:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in the case it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you must add and configure promotions. select Settings promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are fairly self explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window opens the Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to matching Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the day has attribute, and you can schedule their use, activate dialog "Day Edit, if available, to enter a input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in combination with this symbol? replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better represented by using & kiconedit; select from the & kmenu;, graphics further programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to see what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In regard to that the day is start, I decided to create a button "button. by using green (green it usually interpreted, or should be interpreted by a message to user) that click on this symbol is & lt; started in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbols you have to be connected with the action. this happens to the menu with settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, choose it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Use button and continue with other tags, so there is any thing, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement a few common & quantaplus; or it should be shared for a better overview of some separator into several groups. adjust the toolbar to adjust toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (on top left) for my toolbar. after the selection of the element it will be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the arrow to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview a fast way to access the queror. I will list it and add toolbar to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator does not support the grouping. anybody, which does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button the opposite of the button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by adjusting all symbols to make sure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Do not secure in the correct folder. after new eXML does not exist, it will be saved in proper folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc file. so, you fit their toolbar (n) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language, which you like a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use only.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could be in & quantaplus; -repository, whether somebody has already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; - language. then you will need the docrc file. then we override the second part, we will discuss the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc you = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, tag2 = tag.html tag2 = tag.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">Section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 Level = Table of Contents = index.html fting system = basic syntax,... basic syntax = language.basic synchron.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">NOTE the # before Getting started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is no known limit for lease depth (except for the exterity) mdash; but try it out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">NOTE that the contents are referenced directly to a file (and consistent at the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but look out & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendatry.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table section is the area of docrc file. for example, if when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and file referring.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc file, namely to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc, and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure these are well worth, send your docrc file with a description of important info, e.g. which documents were used to the & quantaplus; -repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but are proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative information; are you not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packages, tool boxes with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent with email to friends, partners or else. in different places you can send an email menu, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all others & quantaplus; -users can be downloaded and only available to signify the resource, wherein there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of resource is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case you will need to look for an exhaustion. in the dialog New asset you will need to keep an exhausting (URL preview can be empty), and by clicking OK uploading the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can upload the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar tool bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the inwareness of the resource is warned and it can then be canceled. if integrity given and the resource is correct, then a notification will be displayed correctly with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages that is currently not from & quantaplus; it is currently not necessary to work by adding a DTEP package. there's a simpler way to convert an DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be commenced from the DTD launch and convert a DTD file. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that will be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">The target name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Defining line: the string to appear in! DOCTYPE tag as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / relee.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine-setting of DTEP after the conversion: if enabled, it brings & quantaplus; following the conversion the & descriptionrc; -editor to be adapted with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. this chapter has to be familiar with these fundamental concepts; this chapter has to be closely related to these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this differentiation concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. of toolbars over actions is all that is selected in common folder cture from & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, promotions and samples in a single user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developer for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user folder so that users can use only this user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project leaders are only available within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS, with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which are the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorbox, the builders, box captions with information and toolbars. please find in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the cardboard box with the right mouse button to obtain a text menu with the current document passwords, like close to the current, other or all map documentation, reloading, or upload using CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Legal stacking in the editoral section lead to another context of subtextbooks, like fundamental editing steps (cut / paste / paste / paste in the mouse button or Open the file if the string is called under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the end of the editor, the toolbars are present at the end of the editor. currently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional will be shown as a standard for which a set of tool boxes are shown. in the course of further expansion from & quantaplus; the toolbar will be adjusted to the new features and thus associated user needs.</seg>

<seg id="2091">Installation views (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate and feed them. in the presentation with cardboard box, documentation, documentation, attributes, attributes, attributes and documentation may be provided.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool designed & quantitative information provided in the project and allows to manage all files in the project via right mouse click. actions like add, remove, upload or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of synaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which link can be used. global templates are always available, local templates are only available for the users and templates in projects are only available in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information on the available scripts. the concept of the integration into Global, Local and Project will also work here. by clicking on the right button of the mouse, you can delete further functions such as the script to start, edit or send by email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one indicates the internal structure of the active document. by adding an element the cursor is set on the position of the element. by right-clicking it opens a list of commands to navigation and submission of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other buildings. with it, lack of attributes and namespace can change. the changes of all available attributes can be clicked with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. you can create a pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and considered project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus has; two antitators at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useless information: the windows window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This box shows information about each in Quanta running script. so, for example the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This box display shows all error in the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The synaplus; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show it on a symbol and they receive the respective command. the chocolate is the opportunity to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. if they receive a toolbar to compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if they receive an toolbar at an email, they can secure it in & quantaplus; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; if you have a number of options to get to the configure script. to find a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and run here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting from & quantaplus; you should review whether your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH to your bin folder. the same is true for & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a well-developed development environment with a multitude of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During effort, the best & HTML editor, developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a close-up idea: what would be, if & quantitative information would be? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now it is far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it in & XML; then it should be quantaplus; therefore suitable & IDE; be it.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, up to the above claim must be kept that & quantaplus is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development municipality is based on what a man has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffold is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; so as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can easily increase the automation around any task. by the program KomPass, they can still extend their script syntax. (more on how to find them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and was quickly developed to a well-developed editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; linked to the original developer the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program produced.</seg>

<seg id="2197">Templates are important in the essential Document string, code calopes and files for link. such as a usual file system with extented organisation and interfaces. you can copy, move or any other system in the Vorlagtree; templates are in & quantaplus; in about the limitations they are presented to the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using img src = / src / url). some examples are found in the pre-tree below global templates. further information about templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text documentation. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in such a way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the precursor tree below global templates. see in more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be re-added in documents. you can find all from a comment on a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. see in the pre-tree tree below global templates. see in more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, we serve as templates for all sites of templates. you are organized a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder cture. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure based on popularity (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and save file as presentation of local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it's saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check out in the tree tree below.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As a template to store as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and put on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be used in a preference folder. you can remove all file management functions such as pulling and inserting or inserting across the file storage of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can choose to create a folder in the file area or in the project files looking to create a name for the template and secure it. by default, it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target procedure. you can include headers and footer and create dynamic with & PHP; create, add files or link with them. in addition, one can keep some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The preliminary structure in sub-window templates is based on the files specified in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates / apps / Quanta / templates / apps / Quanta / Templates / Quanta / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the folder's behavior with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop down box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded when linked under parental attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adjusts for everything except the master folders. if a master folder would be disable, except they would be explicitly able. in case of a normal folder the blaj would appear with something like a text module. if nothing appears, there is probably in a tribal.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows advance displayed or subsequent text for templates in this folder. this could be general header or footer for all templates for a particular project and enables copying contents in a folder with special header lines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a complete command collection (on it, right-click) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and include templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; & Source text editor, which can be accessed via the menu View. the first mode replaces the source code in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; -editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor is as follows: he will publish a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit it and if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; -editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor to a document, the & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandiliate from & PHP; does not display them directly with the VPL; editing, it is still the source code editor. there are no plans to change these behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except in the source code editor and in the VPL; -editor is visible and the cursor is running in the source code editor and in the VPL; this mode is already active, the button is offset by the active Cursor from a window to the application, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization ratio between VPL; -Editor and source code editor, you can choose between synchronization following a click or automatically select option. in principle, the recommendation can be set between synchronization following a click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted for fast machines and a big span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose, you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags is also called. as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; Editor. this serves as a new document being created with the VPL; meaning you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags include the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta items can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down below. a click into the list allows the change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules to the list below the list. changes on the list is only possible like with the meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is like in a word processing, possible with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is possible. the marking will work as usual. lyrics can be inserted by shopping and using the button or removing the button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The inserting Tags shall be made in the same manner via the toolbars, as in source code editor, e.g. if a anchor day, surrounded by text, each other means that each other means must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool boxes, such as the tables assistant or lists are deactivated. you will work later in the & VPL; but in this release, the tables or lists can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the test of styles. in contrast to other programs for still styles, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the styles can be tracked.</seg>

<seg id="2267">& xsldbg; is a program for debugging (debugging) in XSL-Stilable (XSL = Extensible stylesheet Language). & xsldbg; has similar things like the Unix / Linux debugger gdb. there are three ways to perform a stylistic template:</seg>
<seg id="2268">Xsldbg --shell --cd & lt; PATHgt; --param & lt; NAMEgt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</seg>
<seg id="2269">Starts a shell. enter the & xsldbg; -command "help" to get an overview of the help.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Adds the parameter to the name & lt; NAMEgt; and the value & lt; VALUEgt; added to the XSL environment variable. see also the "addparam" command.</seg>
<seg id="2271">If the conversion is 20 times, when --repeat is specified, conversion will be 100 times.</seg>
<seg id="2272">The entries are treated as HTML files if the support was activated in libxml</seg>
<seg id="2273">Activates the Xîde processing of the input signal if the support is enabled in libxml. it is switched on for default.</seg>
<seg id="2274">On systems with the readable readline library, you can log off with the arrow keys on / off via the running bins of the hitherto commands.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Several commands require more than an argument. it can be used to transfer the expressions as an argument. & eg;: using the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as an argument is set up in a file with the name "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>
<seg id="2276">Template _ NAME: a valid name of a template which consists of the ASCII characters 0x00 to 0x7F. this name can be a fully qualified name such as "XSL: templateName."</seg>
<seg id="2277">Filename: a valid local name on the system of the user. on Unix- or Cygwin-systems the name must have the prefix "~" as a short form for the personal folder. on RISC-OS systems are also allowed further environment variable.</seg>
<seg id="2278">Path: a path to the exchange of the work folder. on some operating systems, the prefix "~" is replaced by the path to your personal folder.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Data: the XML data or XML _ document that is edited by the Stiltemplate. see also & lt; FILENAMEs; and & lt; URIgt;</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparison. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated, because one of the contributors had been corrected and at the same time it was corrected to many places. another programmer had changed in the same file much text. the result were numerous conflicts during compaction.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program was used for me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no references to the digits, where perhaps only the reverse had changed. the result of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3, which could represent the difference within a line and changes to white signs. later, any more valuable functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare plain text, copy it to the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was comparing and collapse of folders. this feature turned & kdiff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way mercting perform is fully supported if two people are working independently from each other in one piece code functions and changes at the same time. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor you can even edit the result. the screenshot shows three source files when using:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; will also help you Compare and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; for the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and evaluates the possibilities of current color monitors. if you have to check code monitors, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tab are displayed visible. if lines are only distinguished in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the left side of the left side. (no worms more if no one changes the reverse)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates that the file is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are in the same name, but in different folders, you can make the tip by typing only the file name for the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Coldiff3 Ordner1, folder 2, 2, Ordner1, Ordner1, Ordner1, Ordner1, Ordner1, Ordner1, Ordner1, Ordner1</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening the dialog gives manual type of file names, selecting the file browser (File...) or selecting an recently opened file. you will need to specify a third file in the next time. if you have to run the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the Compare and merge file will be selected, for B and C, but using a file, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in both other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is crossed, the input field is active for goal and can process itself. however, it is not necessary to specify a output file later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can specify options before you start with the Compare / summary.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare an entire file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; enables you to select text pieces from the clipboard in the active comparison of comparison, you can't connect to the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and insert a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes it contains a file e.g. several similar features. if you need to figure out how to find these functions it would be a relatively large expense. you would need to copy and compare these options. now you can easily copy and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">NOTE: currently you can delete nothing from & kdiff3; only the text of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and copy of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each textbox, the information line contains the sign A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (NOTE that Windows C is optional.) Every path is too long, let the mouse take a while on line. then a small emergency window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source code matches the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees that the file is different. if both files are different, the default color is for that color. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is very useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text is the summary column. when differences were found, the column displays the respective colour. when differences in white signs, color is not so important to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + such, white signs are only relevant in string and commentaries, for the prevalence and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column of the text is broken down, where the source file has no lines. if the line file is activated, the line is dotted line with a broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparisons) has also an info-line with the inscription Output:, the filename and [amended] if you already have the result. usually, it contains the automatic merging already text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! to all the conflicts dissolves, the Save is disabled!!! (use the buttons to be found in unconsolate / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, any difference in the manual is to be resolved simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Due to a click with the left mouse button in one of the window, the first line of the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then emphasize the current group. it will be highlighted using the color background color for the current range and on the left the screen appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, the automatic merging or through manual operation does not leave any more line in the group; then in this lines the text & lt; no line in the quotations; this text is not displayed in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you might copy and somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; collapsible; however, in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">NOTE: if selecting the sources you ignore the Options or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in figures or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard buttons, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can also use the keyboard buttons in the beginning, at the end, at the end, Strg-Start and Strg-end, Siw can also be used by other programs to navigate directly to the navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye centre you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert button you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns backs up the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as described in the section, and editing the editable outline).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar also contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference (Ctrl-picture backward / Ctrl-picture backward) or for the next / pre-resolved conflicts. therefore, not automatically solved the conflict. therefore, must be distinguished between soluble and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is activated, you will always log into the clipboard, but be cautious with this option, but you might be accidentally overwriting the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line-pods are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-return character\, and Win32-based systems use Wagention +\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the source of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and will be restored on the next Start. (menu Settings &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a firm width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides scripts with variable width to choice you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italics are displayed. if the chosen font is not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be displayed in their pure form but would be rendered automatically. on these systems the knob adjustments an unawakened color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, the key number is inserted when pressing the tabulator key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you enter entering or Return, the line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard. manual copy then drops the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files is attempted & kdiff3; first, all of them can be ignored in the source files. only during this first step, white characters may not be ignored in this step. in this step, white signs are not ignored. also when coaching, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car callsign '\' r 'and the line-back switch'\ '. usually ignored and kdiff3; the car callsign be visible, but if this option is visible, the car callsign be visible, but the default is to be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are not shown in the result, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense according to smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default settings. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic rejump mode this setting, how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the next unsolved conflict is discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically solves automatic conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection). if you are using it better if the auto selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + -comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in Section to scan folders and merge tracking. see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merger.</seg>
<seg id="2337">When a file is saved and an older version exists, then the original version will be the suffix .orig. if such a backup file is running with the suffix .original, this will be deleted without a further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">The language of user interface. the change of this option does not affect the current running program. you need to stop and start to start the change. (this option is set in the KDE release of & kdiff3; not available because the language is adjusted there globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be configured separately for each entry. if you are activated using this option, the upper settings will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">A brief indication of the choices for the coding is a brief indication of which the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and has a pure informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file coding for source files. this affected may be treated as special characters and can be interpreted individually, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you edit a file, you can specify where code can be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preachuting commands, it might not work with your codec. (e.g., your files can not work 16-bit ASCII, but the pre-working command can only be fixed with 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to press any changes in white characters into text or reviews. (NOTE: this also applies to changes in figures or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + -comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only when you compare three files. in normal mode, you'll see only the differences between two of three files. according to choose from A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C; next to the normal one another supervised column is displayed with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Ordering the comparison window to each other or above. this can also be useful to displays long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click will perform collapse and uses the file names for output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge file, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can remove this function for example to cut off irritating parts or correct the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command, and the command of the command has been given first (see above), then the issue of the command is only used when line-up command. each input line must have the corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable users more flexibility when saving the Diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program the best. however, the good news is that in most cases ed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">In this context, use this pre-working order for line input: Sed 's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 /' The. * is a productive expression of any character set out in the first clamp. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other Versioncontrol systems use some keywords to automatically recover files (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). thus you will change the same pattern $\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with Sed, begin to understand and perhaps you may think this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs to support the very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignoring of figures actually is a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-working order for Zeilenabetting 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every character between '[' and ']' is a hit, and every hit will be replaced automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple arrangements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to disconnect the objectives of each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of Sed, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'Allerdings are only for perl some details. where Sed\\ (and\\) are only needed (and) without the set'\\ '. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal prepositives are kept for display and cohesion. the other operations change only the data that the line-off-Algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">NOTE: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off-processor comes as input from the normal preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as in any function, the text changes or differences, you may not notice certain differences and in worst case important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to process many files in a folder. this is why you can compare and merge complete folder to a folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... power a proposal for each object; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and simulates the simulated changes without them truly perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... the selected actions can be made either with all (F7 key) or only selected by the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the Compare and merge of single files. you only need to specify file on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged then Folner1 is used as a base. if no target audience was given, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as the target group.</seg>
<seg id="2367">NOTE that only the comparison of folders will automatically launch the merging. to start collecting, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While downloading the folder you will be informing a little news of the current progress. if you cancel the folder, only the files listed below were listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the file is completed, displays & kdiff3; a list of list with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder can be found during the scan, shown here in a tree. you can choose an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder cture is usually displayed together. you can double click on the + / - click on the picture or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu includes two functions of the subdirectories and all signatures can open up with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file will be started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail of the selected object. in such a case, the collision rate will not be selected automatically. if the result will be launched, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As in the above picture is shown in the columns A / B / C the colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if its overall content is identical. then, folders are the same color. in folders, the age is insignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a sheet which is only green then becomes yellow and later when it's old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C does not have the same file type (e.g. if A a file and B file is): error: contradictory data types. as long as such flawed objects may exist, the result cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A a file and B file is): error: contradictory data types. as long as such flawed objects may exist, the result cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active if only two files and no explicit target audience were indicated and if the option directories is synchronize. then select the necessary promotion, thus both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: summarizing and the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for output file only B; directly after combining copy & diffuse 3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the new file will be selected, then you examine & kdiff3; the date of files and if the files are different, but the date is identical.. as such, the date is not fixed, the resulting file may not be started.</seg>

<seg id="2388">If in alignment dialog the file comparative analysis is selected, KAL3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unsolved problems, unsolved, white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed if three files are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can result in either the selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. when you have selected all internetting actions (also in all sub-folders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not given an target group, then in the three-folder merge mode C will be used as the target, in the two-folder merge B will be used as target and for synchronizing A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target group, please check if all entries are to be displayed in the folder area, and there are some options through certain entries might be skipped. check these options to avoid unlockable surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To result with all entries, select directory setting / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key symbol). to perform only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory file types still exist, a notification appears on the defect elements. they can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you perform all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options run, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Simulate Simulate when you would like to see what would happen without that really changes. you will get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads to specific action with all entries. if a manual input is necessary (combining a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are ready with a file, you will re-start logging / continue or press F7. if you are not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; make a mistake, a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will proceed to skip the cause of the problem. so, if you proceed to dissolve the problem, or to avoid the problem, you may proceed to other way before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually merged, notably & kdiff3; this entries (in the current session) and results in later, all entries are not stored again. even if you change the merge connection, these entries will be guided once again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Kreducing 3...) has now a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern list will be displayed in the elemental tree. there are several samples to be inserted. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. file must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders made in this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can display more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. the default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders made in this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can display more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. the default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that are also ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set using a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hired -attribute. this option allows you to decide whether these files are displayed in the element name or not. this option is enabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2406">In links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic shortcuts are compared to the option, the files will be compared to which the links will be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off: if the option is switched off, the links such as normal files are compared and recursively perspectives. (note: a link to a folder itself would lead to a file of the loop itself and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is dismissed in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics-columns. (the number of unsolved, unsolved, not - white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is being applied slower than a simple binary analysis, which contains no text. (enter a polemy anti-sample).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large file over a slow network, it may only compare the changer date and your file size. however, it will cost you a certain measure of safety. please use caution. this option is togging by default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly to a changer date. there is no real comparison instead of it. that can be equal to the same if when copying the changer date is lost. please use caution. this option is togging with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating synchronising mode when two folders are compared and no target audience was selected. in this mode, the proposals will be identical. the results of the files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered uncertain, because the other file is not modified also. you should check this in any case.) This option is dismissed in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file is replaced by another file or delete the extension .original If an old backup file is already deleted, then this will be deleted without another backup. this also applies to the normal operating result of individual files, not only the collapse whole folder. this option is switched on in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the Folder merge operation remains visible to the combining single files. if you do not want to move the window dividing window with the mouse, you can switch the window folder in the window menu, switching between the both views and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file using double click. however, you can use a single file directly from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be settled, and the file will not run again if you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KAL3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders based on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a separate archiving file with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. some things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively und.or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, standby &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, due to the file system on the server sometimes, a short list of limitations follows:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder. you will always receive a file as link-target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date from the original. (note the option to be confidential.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently available as a differences-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts the right mouse button of the differences between the differences and then select In Kdiff3Part of the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files; however, it takes a patch file in Unified, and kdiff3; the names of the patch exists in the Unified format. then one of the two files must exist. then start and kdiff3; the patch needed to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can select a patch file and select from the text menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that this file doesn't work if any of the original file has changed since creating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; the part is executed, only the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the quotation or the list of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now Heis it compare) there are already. moreover, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it may result in diff3 from the Diff Tool-Collection.</seg>

<seg id="2431">You probably have the program compiling from the sources and the configure script may not be found the correct prefix to KDE. in default, KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (such as kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are dealt with as identical; but if only one-white character is different, the line will not be treated as not identical. iF rlines, next to each other, this is is coincidence but this is is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor can be noted for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. this important information is lost when the result is stored just as text file, and it is too much effort to design an extra a file format which could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big so far. you can still produce a certain version of a source A / B / C. to process larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly missing; No src left; published and the text can't be put aside. what does this and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used many colors to highlight the differentiation. even more herring would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>

<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder, and therefore not in the target group.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in current program version, you have to update the folder with the update feature in these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">It will only be displayed entries to copy the differences in the target file. if the target file does not contain these files, they are missing after the target. (behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is dismissed in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2448">NOTE the buttons to choose from the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window. if the lines are already available, they will be removed during clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. Underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are handled as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minivorous look at all virtual desktop. it is quite practical to change their size on the working areas to finish it or move them. this will work both within a desktop as well as multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktop areas, including running applications. these applications can be selected and even moved on working area and to other areas.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the medium-button a window can be moved inside & kpager; the movement can be moved within a desktop as well as other desktop areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The text menu depends on which the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpager, it is clicked, the text and the name of the application and the entries may minimize, maximize, on working area and end. commands of the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the working area. appears only if click on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sending the application to selected virtual desktop. only appears when you have clicked on an application.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& likes; is a very powerful application which is constantly improved for new functions. it is optimized for use on high-weak computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you are & like; start a window as shown above. the main window of & kmay; shows the enlarged area of the screen. this image shows the enlarged area of the screen, and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default settings are increased & likes; the area around the mouse pointer as an movable magnifying glass. alternatively, you can & feel; this also causes a selected range of display in the slide window (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse pointer in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer; currently not in the position you can recognize the shape of the mouse button. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can capture the content of the enlarging window. this goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When you add the & Shift; press or use the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. NOTE that the upper left corner of the drop-down door stand and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmay; has a lot of features. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer where to copy them into a file (to add it later into other applications), turn the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts resp. stops the updating of the display. stop the update that the needed CPU time is against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the Update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, Up, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is required.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse show a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (repetitiate-inspiratory syndrome), and that every mouse click pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse zeiger have prepared a while on the same spot. it is thought that every mouse click pain. furthermore, it may emulate the pulling with the mouse, but this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can the pain handle when the mouse comes and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, suffer from pain, you should consult a doctor if you are not allowed to take a doctor if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clear it once again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain that are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against ains that are caused by the use of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic aid supplies, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads out a mouse click as soon as you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart shifter activating, makes & kmousetool; a break, wait until the end of the mouse button. in this way, you can carry out the mouse button. the smart shifts requires a little practice, but you get used quickly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This period has to spread out after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is an intellectual moving switch, the time shifting move (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is stopped, the mouse button is waiting, before the mouse button is left again, if there is no evidence of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports a slow motion by clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, one click with the right mouse button. this moves are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt; the first time it started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears out, you can get & kde; to connect the reaction time. open on Sound & Multimedia, select the sound system and here the tab. there is a slider sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; start at every start of & kde; this function is currently under & kde; available only under & kde; please select the respective documentation for Rate to find out how you automatically start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">If all settings are reset to the values, when opening the dialog, you have already pushed the button, the settings are reset to the last hit by using tightening.</seg>
<seg id="2509">At best use & kmousetool; first with the preferences. in particular, the smart shifts should be pampered at first. if you then click the automatic mouse button, you can later go to the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: the clicking on the neutral review of windows or on locations in the browser window, which does not lead to uncertain reactions. you can't park the mouse to such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should purify your mouse. it is normally quite simple. the trick can't just clean the mouse gel, but also the roles that come with the mouse hemisphere.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must remove the mouse hemisphere. like this is done, it should be clear from mouse to mouse, but it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the lock, which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can easily scrapped with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just begun in this case the smart alternate means that & kmousetool; the operation does not end through the batch of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; move under a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists, that you can run a mouse click here. by this, the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and thereby putting the cursor to another point.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to make it out. but if you don't want to make your mouse on a neutral field. secure zones for mouse pointer are hiding; the grey surfaces around the toolbars and menus and the title line of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shifter, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shifts is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can move it. it is very likely to move it into the clipboard or to re-end it in the clipboard. but it will probably even take problems. here are some advice here:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart alternating if you just start to use & kmousetool; please select one end of the text area to use and hold the Shift key, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and click again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Do not use the audible mouse click. this way, when & kmousetool; the mouse button is expressing a sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the smart shifter also without the audible mouse click. but for this, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; the XTest extension for & X window must be installed. this should be the case already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and are set correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; stressed the mouse button soon as soon as the mouse pointer has been created for people that suffer from RSI syndrome, and those affected of the stains pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured for a particular time that a pulling process begins, before the mouse button is left. in this way it can also be carried out using the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Detailed user documentation can be found with help: / kmousetool (enter either this & URL; into the address bar of & konqueror; or run khelpCenter help: / kmousetool).</seg>

<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the standard text passbook. from the text passages you can often select text passages, without them to type. the passages can naturally be processed.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screenshot) determine the dictionary for the Worship Suppression. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words. in addition, you can only specify the word lists using an OpenOffice.org dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a running memory of the already spoken sets (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced abilities of & ktts;. for normal work with & ktts; filters are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is edited before he is sent to the program speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation, to make false spoken words or shortcuts, or to make certain shortcomings of voice synthesis and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the workings of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four kinds of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it will be preloaded to all other orders and will hold these contracts. if the edition of the screen Reader is read, the restrained contracts will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important messages such as & eg; processor turns to hot. a warning has the priority and keeps the edition of messages and normalized text. these jobs will be continued after the issuing of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of a application that you can read by & kmouth; one long text on a web page you can enter. & kde; Notices are also news. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text jobs. any order that you are using a text order. KSayit is a text order. KSayit is an example for one applications which have text jobs are thought for the issue longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types will be ready in queue, except the output of screen readiness. if a application sends the issue of a screen readers, while & ktts; just such an entry will stop and terminates this output.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you must know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen readings. it will be applied to normal warnings, messages, and text jobs as well as on & kde; -news.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter editing the text and continue to pass it on the next filter. there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replacement parts replace parts of an text by other text. the resulting parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions: -) by text or for the format of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; available in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Recreformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; provided by a format into another format. included some XSLT files to the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With spokesperson filtering, you can send contracts on content of the text, or depending on the text, sent to a speaker. if you have sent a female voice to a speaker, you can read the text by KDE news about it. "read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has set the rules where it will apply to a language edition. if the filter indicates that its rules is not applicable, he will continue to move the text on the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or an & kde; - notification will be sent automatically by all activated filters, which are arranged on the side down below. the machining by the filter are processed in the list from above.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This displays the list of the matching normal filter. is a filter not crossed and will not be used. filters are processed above from the top down.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. choose the style of the filter, and it will be shown below the following entry dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up string filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative pattern. the text will be replaced in text, then the text will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter your filter a name. this name you may choose any number, it must only differ from the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of the words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the string bets in the column match and replaced it in alignment with the string of the column. the list is shown in the displayed order from above.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the marked word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list, and list the entries from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Here is a language registered, the filter will only be used when the speaker is given in the text order to display a list of languages. you can also select one list of languages available for mouse click the & Ctrl; -key pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Here is a value assigned, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs by using Kommata. example: conversation, kmail</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a voice's voice and the sound height. plus marks for controlling the instruction language, for example Abbreviations. SSML is part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C standards.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. following limitations are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the Rab _ diphone voice (british male) as this is the standard voice, the festival is used with the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration options are not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually very monoton spoken.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two kinds of filters - normal filters and typing filters (SDB filter). thus the first set can be synthesized, because only the first set can be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can start or cancel and cancel, even if the voice synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-up filter. during the first start of & ktts; as a default set-up filter is automatically set up. you can change your settings or add another set-up filter.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way, you can read the set selection from and give text to read. on the card selection, you will change some properties and check how the selection of the microphone has changed. to this, you have to set up more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start with the pre-read, since only the first proposition has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can submit text orders then on the card card orders or cancel, even if the voice synthesizer is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal sentence filter is automatically set up when you can launch kttsmgr for the first time. it can not be disabled, not only be removed, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">The set-boundary filters compare the text with a regular expression of propositional sign (decimalcode 8) to the propositional sign (decimalcode 8) to the propositional sign (decimal characters are removed from the text automatically before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied on & kde; -News (kills), warnings, messages or issue of screen readings.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you remove the standard set-up filter, you can insert it once again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">Selecting the card selection, you can write speaker settings for application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Using the standard law (the highest on cardboard card). with other words, there are no spokesperson for speakers.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When using the appropriate speaking voice, all the features of a set-fit microphone has to be clear or edit, elects & ktts; this speaker selects. otherwise select & ktts; the speaker out, the most originally introduced features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired disk properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired script. if this property plays no role, you do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark the check box if the property shrang before other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when the output is dealt with, it will always be used as a priority feature. if you may want to specify the attribute language, if you know that a particular application was sent in another language than the language listed in the workplace.</seg>

<seg id="2744">In this case there is 0 for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input is 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately if it is started. I have compiled Debit support but I don't get back to trace.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and ktats; it was completed. probably you have to register GStreamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not resolved, possibly a not compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update track and uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output about ALSA does not work if I play a text order at the same time. if I get a text order, friezes & ktts; a message that says: unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts in ALSA may prevent the same time opening of several PCM devices. information for possible solutions can be found on the website of ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-project.org.</seg>

<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf file system cannot install. physical equipment and their drivers have already been working and configured, thus & knetworkconf; the device can be displayed at all and allows adjusting network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed for installing & Linux; you will need to install and set up your network devices later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module settings will be loaded when the network settings is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index selected. when starting the module settings, this system used to automatically detect the platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the platform is offered to select the platform out of the list. by checking the setting Not-again, this setting can be permanently hit. during next start of the network settings, this option will automatically be set preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode. in previous system configuration mode, all options can be displayed, the change is not possible. in the system administration mode, you will need to enter the password mode at the lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system administration mode, the complete functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces is used for managing the network devices. all available network devices are displayed. from the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button... in the dialog device.</seg>

<seg id="2834">Installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool with graphical interface as package-package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; but in addition, the development charge includes libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile these commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology are given, in the second all are discussed by & knetworkconf; changed configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace any further knowledge about IP networks. in this Appendix contains basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found major prevalence. from IPv6 it is expected that this description is mainly focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the main information is the knowledge that IP address is assigned to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrators that can be used for a valid IP address, if your IP address can't be chosen any arbitrary!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When creating an own small (home) network shouldn't be selected for this purpose to avoid IP adresses using the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not transferred on the Internet, so their any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks are usually used addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is suitable for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so all hosts are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for IP supervision.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 Network address is reserved for the IP transport in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes altered by DSL connections, so that it doesn't be surprised if in case of active DSL connections, another content is considered to be specified.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a security program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first goal was to answer a question for tar, which got my wife: how much longer will it take if you are secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; educates the band and reads the pretensioner of the tape. detects & kdat; the spell are not asked if the band will be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the spell will search it after the right index on your plate. cannot be found if the band index should be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If all goes smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive, to indicate that the tape is inserted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to throwing a tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; give you a change in symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band, and shows a message from the status bar. the tape can now be cast off without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A belt file must be formatted before you can use a band before using & kdat; and if you need to formatted a band before use, this process needs to be formatted before using the band from & kdat; so you will need a formatting of the band name, DAT drives, however, will not be formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity departs & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape is lost, the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup procedure, you must select the files to secure. this may be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Choose a file or folder in a local file area. it will only be saved this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a fuse profile in the tree. only those files are saved in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Create files in a local stream tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button, click on the local extensions and select menu to the...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is directed, the dialog for Fuse. in this dialog, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog gives the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the archives in record for the drive. only the selected file or folder is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry.....</seg>
<seg id="2913">As soon as the test procedure was started, the dialog for checking. in this dialog, you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for checking the review, the dialog appears. this dialogue shows the progress of the examination as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reproduce the restore, the files you will need to be restored, and this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to the entry for the tape drive. only the selected file or folder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Create the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only those files and / or subfolders are recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been launched, the dialog for restore. in this dialog, you can check your selection and change the work folder for restoring.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoring, the dialog appears. this dialogue shows the progress of recovery as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it shows itself as necessary to create the tape index file using tape content. this process is deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index to two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a safety profile with the straight files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a fuse profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder, where the backup should be done. the list of files will be updated automatically according to the chosen folder automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders who are listed under backup files that are listed in the same file system, like the folder. folder, which can be applied to any other file system, you can separate separately from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshots will be used. only the files will have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The file name, which is used to determine the changes since last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshots before the call of tar. this causes that all files are secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and, and lt; files was not yet implemented fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings for the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for tape drives (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the belt system.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmitted & killer; before the band is bound by the command to load the drive. in some drives this is necessary to read read or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option switched to block & kdat; the draft at the tape drive. possibly this setting didn't work for all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the release is replaced by & kdat; automatically ejected to the band. use this option at floppy streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable log sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; one band formatted, writes it to the beginning of the band. this file should display only a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file uses as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is host name: second, where hostname is the full name of the system, when the band is formatted, the number of seconds, which have been formatted since the epoch, formatted in the band.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file using the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar-archives created directly with & GNU; - tar, even other tar versions should work as long as it is not in incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup band. this symbol is only active if a band is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -viewer for system protocols. the program is not suitable for inexperienced users who can't retrieve information about your system, or where system allows you to perform the different protocol files; experienced users access information about problems that can occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where system changes the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows for the quick access to the example on problems that perform on their server. & ksystemlog; thus attempts to provide some advanced features, which can be filtered and analysed according to their help.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog has developed; a number of useful features, including among others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also contained in addition and are explained in further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screens you can see & ksystemlog; functions, with the help of the single protocol lines of a protocol-file easily filtering and sort. the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start attempts & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol will be launched, so you will not start with system administrator. the protocol files will usually not be found in the folder / var / log, for the normal user normally have no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar in order to filtering the filter bar in order to clear the filter bar. in the default setting, the list contains the drop-down menu, which will only be displayed for selected filters. then, in one of columns, the default values of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place. for example, in the protocol command system protocol, you can only select the column process, and carry you out into the filter bar the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines are sent and created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors will be displayed using a display color lines of step-lines. the color depiction of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to see only certain process (for example in the system protocol or cron protocol), so you can find the process identification as for example, if you would like to examine the output of a certain command as for example, using the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the main menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; enables displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open and manage the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindows. once you selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more information about the source of supply units of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following as named) as & ksysv; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init rapidly developed into the standard for checking the program start at the Hochcycle of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it's easier to use, powerful, and also more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it yourself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. This is why someone could try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstall and new formatting. therefore, you need to make sure the old init was removed from there, if there was one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init is also different from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a whole lot of scripts. basically you need to start a script for each system service, you do not need such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things such as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be able to run under / etc / rc.d, if you require it. you can also use a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run out there if you have to do anything with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is registered in / etc / inject. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can design a look into the second column. if you want to change that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair any changes, then you can repair it by adding the system, and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -L in rc3.d, then you will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you cannot find correct files. instead, every entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it actually accepts a argument as start and stop. you can actually start the scripts of your hand by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one contains a K, the script will be called stop. if it includes an S, the script will be called by argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish for a simple way to create machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server run-level, that can run only httpd, & sendmail;, Network & etc; run it also could also be a user -Runlevel; & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you get the use of & ksysv; and it should not be very difficult because the program was as user friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say not to say trivial: draw an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevel to stop him on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts between Runlevles or change their position within one level, in which it is somewhere else. this will not be drawn by its original runlevel (or his position). this happens if they pull a entry from the existing system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Please note: entries will be postponed if you need to select this in a new runlevel. you must select explicitly copy from Edit menu or select from the menu window - even then, if the same entry has already been existing in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Sometimes the sorrow number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the modified entries, before you can try again the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Please note: there is no way to reproduce entries that were thrown into the trash bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator key to activate the different operating areas (runlevel 1 Start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection over- or below the current.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insertion (Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorrow number or name of a single entry, press the tab button to change the Properties dialog button, to accept the dialog button to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu requires a confirmation before it is executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc file, if it is available. otherwise it will be recovered from & ksysv; changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runlevles, and now the machine is constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inscab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; as a runlevel X version, but it will not run.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, like system services in these distributions, unfortunately, the configuration for the proprietary incention programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning a extension of the program for that approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and if you are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are easily terminated without message if your configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. in case you can use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be attached.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; is it sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you've made changes you have to save this. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry Save in menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card types, the user and the user group list. for example, choose the desired users or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some maps are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have extended system settings, you will be able to make individual settings, if shadow -passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd will be installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password manager will appear if shadow -passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd may be installed as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map illustration only appears, if for at least one embedded file system limit (Quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable to the file quota). here you can change parameters at any user, whereby the restrictions can be changed in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">This parameter can be set individually for each file system. the current file system will be selected using the field monitoring system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups informs about the group flag of the selected user. the standard group, at which the user belongs, you can find the user in other groups, by selling them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select from the menu users or group or click the matching Add button button. edit or delete the selected user or the selected group is analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can add the LILO boating system to modify and change the boot passwords, adding the time to the booting of the standard operating system, remove, change, change, change, change and more.</seg>
