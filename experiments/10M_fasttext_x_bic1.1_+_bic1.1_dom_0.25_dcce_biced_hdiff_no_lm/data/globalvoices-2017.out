although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely big .
how many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have read and operated American authors .
in fact , this country had a pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly due to an American Film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered a mur@@ der@@ ous rebel@@ lion with the help of Julia Roberts , who covered the highest Federal Court with judges who wanted to occup@@ y his interest .
I was caught .
free to method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is absolute truth , all others think it is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only inten@@ si@@ fied my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming you can always be the way you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even wrote a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the tourism and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ en@@ sion is for me , how he is surrounded by working .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he consi@@ ders how a former colle@@ ague expressed , and open@@ ly declar@@ es his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
nevertheless people responded to his statements and tun@@ ed him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won at the Republi@@ can Pre@@ sidential elections was the highest number ever reached by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked myself ?
I could not have tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers to harmony with people who I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journal , who receives people from all over the world , who have taught me about Islam and its past .
with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present publisher of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , also appro@@ ached .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met us at our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
Tr@@ umps int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I fought at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for life for life , and her husband Dave , my host family , which treated me as her son .
it still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ it , who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues to sp@@ oil us to the complex@@ ity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors that assist@@ ed me have helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those who em@@ per@@ ate themselves are deep@@ ened my love in America .
while Tr@@ ump leads his way to the nominal re@@ publi@@ can pre@@ sidential nom@@ inees , they coven@@ anted with me a stop and counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , pre@@ sidency of a man , despite - or perhaps not because of its contemp@@ t compared to non @-@ white people .
the con@@ front@@ ation with the idea that men voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either sharing out his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to record the tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ ers as a r@@ attle .
the people as@@ sign , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is su@@ perf@@ icial , respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who deal in another way , and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and anx@@ ieties are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be , that these vot@@ ers know , from which most white are , for Tr@@ ump tun@@ ed , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country they dis@@ appo@@ int ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in America ?
perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who want the cru@@ el decision to rise a man who looks like contemp@@ t on those who look different from it .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( Gr . ) : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of the White against all other Eth@@ n@@ ias &quot; ; Word Game from white into play on the White and Wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , as much does the great Van Jones called it , has just killed what America did so great .
millions people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether my@@ th or reality , there is still a powerful idea - what faith or background can you always have , America is called every welcome .
for this country selected as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose history as he himself said , now@@ here else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , however , is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with vers@@ at@@ ness , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rud@@ der , they say .
in all that I must think to Kh@@ iz@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said at the eve of the election .
at a demonstration in Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word exchange with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; could anyone who do not have such a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an un@@ anim@@ ous and loud &quot; N@@ EIN &quot; !
Mr. Khan was closed with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was ber@@ ered .
the land , for which his son was pleased , sent him a message .
this is now bo@@ unded country , told the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could no longer be found in that new America .
and this takes me my heart .

of the mis@@ ery to stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t leave their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ian city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the music , which is played in both places , has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , who lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill colony , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ colonial ruins and world famous cuisine .
since a few years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the commun@@ e : one from children and adults made an existing Symphony Orchestra , which with their musical instruments has found a possibility to overcome them about poverty .
a school with 100 students can become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drug abuse and the gangs fire .
but this changed after an acc@@ id@@ ental meeting with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare ho@@ pel@@ essly .
young band members accept their duties due to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , run through the dust streets to pursu@@ e their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ e@@ bel you meet day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i and con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ .000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is prac@@ tically on the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay - on instruments , made from recovered waste material :
music instruments made of local solid waste materials made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycled pul@@ leys of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z began to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate po@@ ds , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , trombones and percussion and all of the tr@@ ash were made .
the re@@ pertoire en@@ comp@@ asses classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian and Latin American music and music of Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z remin@@ ds of a local Ö@@ col@@ o@@ ge and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to re@@ hear@@ se in the same place , who had had no music at the same place , who had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not collabor@@ ate with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o , what he had never seen before : a viol@@ ent produced violin .
today there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments made of recovered materials and will be called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic waste dump ) draws the musical performance :
each year , the world produces approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and live by him are the trouble - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something nice .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his in@@ spir@@ ing spect@@ acle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team work can fight against illegal fishing companies
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that target@@ ed solutions for international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication happens during an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of Content .
it was known that this ship was already in West Africa that this ship had already run illegal fishing barrels before spre@@ ading the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries had therefore raised and inc@@ lined little , a law bre@@ ver of this type to welcome their c@@ ows .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mos@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles are sw@@ if@@ tly against the ship . they ref@@ use to ask one of their har@@ bo@@ urs and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to start f@@ ishes there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of the lo@@ oting of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , crossed and protects resources , FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , was founded by the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) in 2012 .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar who had driven six countries that the Premier came out of their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; thus we have eight countries and work together and work together . you exchange information from and are mut@@ ually placed where it is illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the PE@@ W Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts ( F@@ ishing . this project offers FISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is being caught is hidden , why it is hidden that it is extremely difficult to absor@@ b , thus the illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by deli@@ ber@@ ty use of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ it@@ ats and types are supposed to harm the illegal fisher@@ ies of ec@@ os@@ ystem , which have a del@@ ic@@ onic po@@ ise equ@@ il@@ ibri@@ um .
yet while actions against illegal fishing had been hin@@ dered by bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dles , and also caused by the snow@@ drops , with the information between individual countries , the actions will be in real time , with trac@@ eable to FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
the individual countries inter@@ change each other , e.g. lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ ects activities or details that could be noticed during a har@@ bor inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if they move on the open sea , satellite phone .
it enables to mark the authorities to detect ships , in forbidden areas of fish , such as susp@@ ects that a ship loaded his caught fish to other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a crime .
countries that are against illegal fishing catch can be refused on the basis of such ships in their ports . what means that ships cannot be sold their cargo as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to reach , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Berg@@ h , executive director of NF@@ DS Africa . latter is a advis@@ er company which is responsible for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win $ 20 million USD in lost turnover , which lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fisher@@ men who penet@@ rate in East African Wat@@ ers .
in East Africa , one of the most productive tuna fishing is essential for the region &apos;s commercial fisher@@ men from all around the world . among those one even fl@@ ares an illegal fisher@@ men .
zu their practices including actions count as the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake roy@@ alty paper , indication of Phant@@ as@@ ien@@ amen , the fish protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this leg@@ ally si@@ p hole att@@ empt@@ ed to close FISH @-@ i now .
until now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has exposed criminal networks that had caught f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that have several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it fig@@ ured ships and found .
Co @-@ operation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crimes , FISH @-@ i can judge information about illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; some of our research projects quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Berg@@ h .
he builds a system that will help FISH @-@ i to loc@@ ate sur@@ render vessels .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system which will always be refined , thereby also helps to ref@@ use illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ men use very refined techniques to conce@@ al their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Che@@ f@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Track@@ ing , a N@@ RO , which offers himself with fishing licence and FISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships put on for instance their automatic identif@@ ier systems , which will not be able to generate more of satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects various information carriers . FISH @-@ i can help you find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but FISH @-@ i can actually influence Africa &apos;s team of South Africa have no effect on the und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly global issue of illegal fishing companies ?
John Amos , president of the N@@ RO sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth opened up with Google and the Marine Protection Organization oc@@ e@@ ana , the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform , the satellite system , and can be displayed in each navig@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is simply a sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to ver@@ ify himself and their resources to investig@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; PE@@ W Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project with which a global system will permit the persec@@ ution of ships .
there is evidence that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel cri@@ min@@ als , but it also happens .
ships that were used earlier without licence and hardly any imp@@ lic@@ ences we know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in FISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after FISH @-@ i Somalia also helped gre@@ et , the inspec@@ tor found there on board Schle@@ pp@@ ets , whose use is forbidden .

recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia report his first big tri@@ umph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag . and not just the boat was on the road and were now prohibited by now .
the ship was still in@@ ev@@ oked in b@@ anned waters which are reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of action against Gre@@ ko 1 set the strong sign that it will proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berg@@ h .
for FISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , col@@ abor@@ tive work@@ ings works towards the protection of the oc@@ eans . Emma Bry@@ ce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she works on the topic of the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is trying to go to : demonstr@@ ations in several cities with the aim of re@@ con@@ quer the country &quot;
the road movement in Venezuela was only to be the beginning of a wave of fier@@ y demonstr@@ ations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the minister of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back@@ order of Venezuela ) can be found both images from these demonstr@@ ations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the area of Bar@@ inas , in the regions of Mérida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central North of Bun@@ dest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta .
the political and economic situation of the country is wor@@ sen@@ ing , which occur in everyday life of the Ven@@ ez@@ ans by an ac@@ ute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; however , the maintenance of a new election was blocked by official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , Contri@@ butors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , deals in its latest articles the context of the government decree as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ) and in which a gra@@ ving and extensive lack of food and medicine is to re@@ con@@ quer the country the chance to re@@ con@@ quer its inst@@ itutional structures and establish a new govern@@ mental alliance .

the first demonstration within the framework of the campaign &quot; The return of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October .
the images from the mart@@ yr@@ s , which are in real @-@ time , witnesses the over@@ whel@@ ming participation of people in many areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen as well as prop@@ on@@ ents of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ators who through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? , &quot; write this Ven@@ ez@@ ian region .
it is enough , without gr@@ inder .

on Twitter more pictures can tell from disp@@ utes , as well as reports of suppression and abuse .
especially large waves beat the news of police dep@@ ots in the central city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators go back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the government and armed forces from the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safely , but the prot@@ ests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators sought to stop police cars , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skirts ... otherwise one could not see what many national gar@@ ages have not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic will make the lap that forms the extent of suppression per day :
thus the dict@@ ator@@ ship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many members of the government had asked the validity of the demand for an am@@ t@@ arian approach - this has now been shown in the eyes of many by the presence of count@@ less people on the road .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs are :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado asser@@ ts that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are f@@ aked .
here is your Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ eb@@ ung !
on the road !
other values evalu@@ ate this prot@@ ests as a further step in the fight against a government saved from their vis@@ ibility against the dev@@ ast@@ ating economic crisis , to avoid critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mart@@ yr@@ s always take more in frequency and intensity .
some Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ans reported the media they were to star@@ ve to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of the Ale@@ jo Gó@@ me@@ z interview with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , which was originally published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine News page .
the interview was translated into English and is published with the friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to visit the at@@ ro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city Córdoba .
as the now grown , Qu@@ ij@@ ano said in the scope of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argentine military dict@@ ator@@ ship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden , same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military per@@ missions in prison La Per@@ la , who observed in the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family of family sec@@ rec@@ y .
in the situation I believed that this was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that one gets man@@ i@@ ated by his father .
I couldn &apos;t recognize that my father was a th@@ ief , fol@@ ks , and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ian military dict@@ ator@@ ship from 1974 till 1983 , his father was from 1976 to 1978 . Deputy Commander of the Department of intelli@@ gence 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the op@@ pression that is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ an@@ os son , a man who knew the extent of the at@@ ro@@ cities that he had lived as a boy , and who spoke before a court for his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent in his child , and how this child has chosen a way to rede@@ mp@@ tion .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to join me military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I rounded up with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all of them called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that they would not lead you one day and I need to save yourself .
Ab@@ bre@@ viation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ uc@@ ion@@ ario del Pu@@ eblo , - Revolu@@ tionary Volks@@ ar@@ mee - the military arm of the Revolu@@ tionary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me on the military base .
he told me , I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father loved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university connections , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ paganda material , books , simple everything .

&apos;@@ da the prisoners are being tort@@ ured &apos;
my father took me first four times after La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in cars , furniture , TV , cooling units - just everything possible .
everything was st@@ olen .
he gave me a small wrapped in a blank@@ et , and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump in silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the st@@ olen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he interpre@@ ted in an open room and said :
the prisoners are being persec@@ uted .
I saw in and saw a couch , which were tort@@ ured on man .
she looked like a b@@ unk@@ bed and metal colored .
later , I found that it was fast@@ ened to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened at the body of the person that was missing there .
they rarely have a man with wr@@ inkl@@ es on the bed , poured it with water , and pursued after him a charge of 220 volts into gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ is@@ i@@ ón Provinc@@ ial de la Mem@@ oria
the tank there was in fact ... as a dirty win@@ dle .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same sc@@ ent came from his room .
I recognized the sc@@ ent immediately and mine was clear that the smell of a body is in dist@@ ress .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it only possible that a man can do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and fast@@ eners .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ u@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civ@@ ilian who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a set of matt@@ resses , on which naked men were stretched down@@ wards - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated on their hands and feet .
near the entrance to the gates people still rely on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; Why do you look so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I met &quot; Why have you brought me out ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito , &quot; Rom@@ ero pit@@ ched there a man and killed .
according to survi@@ vor@@ s , the Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was also charged to death in Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera ) .
the following video shows Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the Memorial La Per@@ la , through the former fol@@ kl@@ es .
the path that you came in here is also the way where the resulting came from here .
if you &apos;re looking on the map , you see that they took around it and then have been tort@@ ured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were referred to as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization a number .
when she survived torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement came from above that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War m@@ ute &apos;
my father brought all possible things with home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ ri@@ ers &quot; - how they called it - was .
but when I was in the military even when I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war@@ fare was a bay@@ onet or maybe military badge , which one has been fighting a enemy .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano with his son .
archiv@@ ing
but if one goes into a house , and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... dem@@ anded , that is not a war@@ fare , but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is the@@ ft .
I have always asked myself what my Father , the head of security forces , v@@ and@@ alism was carried out in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al it all in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
once he called me a cri@@ min@@ als and I answered : and you who st@@ acked cars on the road ?
you are not det@@ ective ?
he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried out :
if you go so far , then I will find you and put you hanging .
we don &apos;t need any other any@@ body !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then on which I wor@@ e a jacket and a rib@@ bon pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he gave clothes to home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been with this crime . I rep@@ lied , no problem , they can put me to burden what they wanted .
I was there , in order to speak .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ ro@@ g@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel do re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you have only children , you recognize the value of a life .
it evol@@ ves and recogn@@ izes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been ex@@ iled during the dict@@ ator@@ ship . but why did the bodies dis@@ appear ?
why are children kid@@ n@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl back home , whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : you were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I gu@@ ess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies dis@@ appear ?
did these people not give families , whom one could give their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ dic@@ tive act which one can do a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they made machines to elim@@ inate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were sk@@ ipped and sold somewhere . no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing to say to the military .
I was even with the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 cri@@ min@@ als - including my Father .
the idea of view my father , arose during a meeting , when he was put under house arrest .
I made him sharp because of all the at@@ ro@@ cities which I had to live because of time .
then he said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
I felt qui@@ et@@ ly and asked me , what all the ex@@ tri@@ pl@@ ateau patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended they were good .
then I cried out :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed a terrible crime and you have to comp@@ elled me as a child .
he only resist@@ ed &quot; Now , just turn me . &quot;
I exactly did that .
in 2010 , I will refund the first display .
I finally discovered that he was a crime .
no one can design@@ ate me that I am pres@@ umed . I have finally said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 crimes : including severe , un@@ tim@@ id@@ ental liber@@ ty in 158 cases , murder in 98 very severe cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of children under 10 years of age .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the extent of the magn@@ itude of the verdict .
after four years of whom more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial concluded between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 A@@ op@@ pressed charges were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and in nine cases , sent@@ ences resulted in prison sent@@ ences of 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were free check .
eleven of the 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ sia : murder , torture and r@@ ape with am@@ t@@ sp@@ ers@@ . # Es@@ War@@ Staat@@ r@@ orism
all the accused were involved in the dict@@ ator@@ ship members of the military , including former military personnel , former police and civ@@ ilian staff .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kid@@ n@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he put the following words to the Swedish Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory built by un@@ human heads .
the court part is a historical milestone for all human rights of human rights , for years spent on justice for victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who was killed by the children of man who were murdered or disappeared during the dict@@ ator@@ ship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country to La Per@@ la , where a memorial was established there , which is now guided by human rights organization .

a translation mist@@ akes makes older people in Kyoto for &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;
the sign with the transl@@ ating error in a center in Kyoto , in which one can pro@@ long its leadership .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long its leadership position in the last month witnesses of a very special translation .
on a sign the Japanese word ( r@@ int sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means that the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , and perhaps , but also with bad hin@@ ts &amp; # 8@@ 212 , was translated as &quot; aw@@ ful drivers . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from September 1 to 20 in electronic ads in the input field and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into social media .
the bug was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ iv . it was also known to the local news .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n initiated in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this pro@@ ves that nobody has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cal is not completely correct &quot; el@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of the Kyoto &apos;s pre@@ f@@ ecture also imp@@ acted for the release mistake . in fact , she explained that the bug had already been given in the text , and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness .
a blo@@ g@@ ger reported about the sorry :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online mess@@ enger J @-@ Cast News came out more detailed with the phen@@ omen@@ on of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fe@@ ar@@ bar &quot; was attached as an un@@ reasonable description of older motor@@ ists . following the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in acc@@ idents are fully involved .
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 in@@ jur@@ ies were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 803 from 11.@@ 850 acc@@ idents caused .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of acc@@ idents decreased in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused acc@@ idents in the same period .
the nam@@ ing non @-@ called re@@ porter in the article published by the article shows the light , which show the advantages of some Japanese apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation errors was given the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; hor@@ r@@ able car driver &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So is the translation really not , either , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that a real transmission error is . &quot;
there is no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation mist@@ akes are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com Web site is a real treasure for this biz@@ arre bug in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation is multip@@ lied .
to transl@@ ate two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and respon@@ d to active language skills to send it to the target language .
the latter limit requires active screen language - something that is in the native language . in general , the belief that transl@@ ator in the target language - not to be in the original language - mother language .
for example , a French mot@@ her@@ language should transl@@ ate from the English into French - not by the French translation into English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ user Karl Bar@@ on .
many Japanese companies do not emplo@@ y workers with English as native language , the translations to the English . this may be missing for the transl@@ ating , cost grounds , or the relatively low number of English mot@@ her@@ language that can be Japanese .
some companies who do not have any foreign employees , have translations to produce fir@@ ing intern@@ ally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , no matter how good or bad its language skills really are .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ user Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translation is also widespread - often with fun results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and sum@@ pt@@ uous phr@@ ases that origin@@ ate from mach@@ in@@ ial translations , showing that this technique can not replace any human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies particularly to some languages .
some of the we@@ ir@@ d English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also ad@@ dic@@ ure print , often used T @-@ shirts or pockets are used only for sty@@ list@@ ical reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors can be acceptable or at least harm@@ less or at least harm@@ less . however , by major companies or from the government the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto takes a new source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : how to use prot@@ ests and c@@ ens@@ uring measures on the Internet and TV
enter the main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7th , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users registered that they had no access to the online channel Viv@@ o@@ play .
later , other users registered that the Internet access from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are also no longer available .
other online broad@@ c@@ aster transm@@ its recordings of prot@@ ests in Carac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ position@@ able groups to res@@ ist the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s government .
the prot@@ ests began in early April after the Supreme Court uph@@ eld the Parliament and the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive branch and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of an Trac@@ er@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection was short@@ ened to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access Internet access .
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages ven@@ ez@@ ial providers are re@@ im@@ pris@@ oned again .
this is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offer such as Viv@@ o@@ play are popular among the Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant since 2014 on prot@@ ests against prot@@ ests . at that time , the Commission wanted to report with money transactions and closure , as the Commission continued on demonstr@@ ations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
I have registered with @ vi@@ vo@@ play@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
amazing that it is still cheaper than two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro , later , that not only Viv@@ o@@ play through a blo@@ cking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is un@@ access@@ able , but also two more online broad@@ c@@ aster . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
previous re@@ sear@@ ches of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had yiel@@ ded that the local Internet provider can util@@ ize DNS . this is a technique to answer the DNS servers of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS server , the server does not respon@@ d or ref@@ use the request when calling with such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ uc@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ vo@@ play@@ net
in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flores , which was carried out live in Carac@@ as , was taken into custody .
Flores has been beaten , as he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to the show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also regul@@ ates the Internet connection : thus the Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ans directive will keep access to multi media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls are too sl@@ aves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where they worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimony of other cri@@ min@@ als , which were exactly as victims of abuse and dis@@ cri@@ mination .

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report by Kur@@ an , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , waste schools &quot; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family who lived there .
just before her Gradu@@ ation at the University she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was filled with pride regarding them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the place , of which has become something , &quot; said she .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . when Cri@@ ad@@ itas is called in Paraguay the more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a large family with little money survi@@ ves her min@@ der@@ el@@ age son or her min@@ der@@ y daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child will receive a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned , however , that the children may have to pay for count@@ less days of home work , which can never be paid , and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that can &apos;t stand up in the context of a contract .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is very common in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations .
after compl@@ eting her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she talked with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ on@@ ials , research@@ ed and p@@ ran@@ ger@@ te .
she tried to call these things in name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is in@@ jected to Cri@@ mean is as@@ sured in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
since then , the family , who have their daughter in the belief , make it so their voc@@ ational training , improve their position in society and &quot; something from yourself &quot; can give to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which takes up the girl with the faith , and whose explo@@ itation is just@@ if@@ i@@ pled by faith , who would give someone a chance that wouldn &apos;t be an apprentic@@ eship or an hung@@ ered .
the Vic@@ tim of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ ass@@ ed , his family will only hear many years later .
sometimes they even never learn about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phen@@ omen@@ on , which takes place in the bor@@ der@@ ous in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came into hospital , her body showed a blo@@ c pun@@ ches . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás Ferreira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a resident of the residents .
Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
end of January 2016 , Ferreira , with a pole spread to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered le@@ thal in@@ jur@@ ies .
this should be the last pun@@ ishment in the life of young girls .
some days later the media reported on the inc@@ ident .
they pra@@ ised that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , the deeply root@@ ed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian society in Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is responsible for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came together to protest pet@@ itions and dem@@ anded that there was no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more c@@ ows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers , there is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it &apos;s very difficult to control , under which terms of girls and girls live .
the neighbo@@ urs of the couples and almost 60 civil society organisations need an efficient examination of the case .
they want , Tom@@ ás Ferreira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if the first time in history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only be pro@@ claimed as labour , they are also isolated from other girls in their old age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the graphic works , where her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market Candy to earn money .
but they continued all to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their emplo@@ yers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
thus they had to share the time so that you still remained so much for learning .
she got up at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their emplo@@ yers .
Fri@@ days , for example , pur@@ ged the refrigerator , cut off the living room , polished the furniture and the ground in the ground .
when the school was end , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more they had done with learning , the more leisure it had .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their emplo@@ yers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never had an hung@@ red , but he had never got unlimited food . &quot; I needed to pick me more books from the library of the house as food out of the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the land@@ lord , a former military and symp@@ ath@@ ism of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in the dict@@ ator@@ ship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner who was in power between 1954 and 1989 .
in some even@@ ings of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to him and Editorial for Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ als , such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eblo &quot; .
he tried to con@@ vince her to find the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held her for intelligent , but didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; the owner had found someone to listen while he was talking about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord fe@@ ared the education that they had made possible , would be explained again .
however , it was totally clear that it was purchased for everything you get paid for them with tough work .
even in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , are Mo@@ b@@ bing and the Sch@@ ik@@ anas , which cri@@ mp@@ ing are exposed to the school .
because the other children have their parents , they immediately recognize that someone who have no parents , a Cri@@ ad@@ ita is .
I could not invite anyone home to home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friends emerg@@ es , I felt very clearly that I did not belong to any group .
isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Company Ac@@ ts the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group where they can indicate degree in cleaning personnel and child@@ maid in Paraguay .
the admin@@ istrat@@ ors of the group is P@@ EPA Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a subur@@ bs in the District of As@@ unci@@ ón .
Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a small compan@@ ions for my little daughter , which will play in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
learning to learn .
please call you .
starting from Monday when possible .
the ad was received five &quot; l@@ ads &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them .
in the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the land inner which I want to work . &quot;
then the sp@@ a@@ water in the display turned out once more :
dear friends , I found a job . I look at whether it works with her .
thank you so I write again when something is .
the shop was finished .
in the pro@@ log@@ ue to report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long ? ) , a collection of witness statements former cri@@ mp@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as sla@@ very , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Spanish conqu@@ est ) , and to whom the Spanish conqu@@ est had failed to provide you , that many girls and boys remained in a system of sla@@ very , with which they become light victims for abuse and explo@@ itation .
the social in@@ equality in Paraguay and the face of power are the key for the understanding of the phen@@ om@@ ena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
Bill seek@@ s Egyptian users of social media to register at the government
image by Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published by the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary commit@@ tees have recently agreed to &quot; regul@@ ating social networks in relation to use and use of social networks .
when he is adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with govern@@ mental authority in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , one place would be set up , which is commissioned to obtain social media citizens .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users would have to register for users with their proper names and number numbers to use social networks .
if it missed it , this could bring a sentence of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill , consisting of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ids and is independent in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs on the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video teaching and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is assumed if the draft shall not give it out , as the draft opinions on it , as the Egyptian authorities can not record that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , par@@ liam@@ ent@@ aries and suppor@@ ters of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user name and a password by which the fire@@ wall came to block the Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to capture a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of them it would be necessary to adop@@ t the Egyptians in order to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts in front of the site are sc@@ ep@@ tical concerning the technical fe@@ as@@ ibility of su@@ peri@@ ors .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technology is ( in German &quot; conducted research techn@@ olog@@ ous &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt greatly on technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion she found it so that same as they can use viol@@ ent physical public and private spaces they could be done online .
if I take it seriously , so it means that they may apply a powerful surveillance system to apply or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to result in a court process .
it is really realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at the legisl@@ ative committee and the const@@ itutional complaints before it comes to the plen@@ ary .
whether its ass@@ umption and sub@@ mission will be successful or not , the design stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , whose sense shall maxim@@ ize control and ensure that no de@@ vi@@ ations of the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the parliamentary majority of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a bill against Cy@@ ber @-@ Crime , who was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who lead to &quot; public order , &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

a sub@@ species of the larger le@@ op@@ ards of Leop@@ ards , op@@ posed by Africa and Asia , belong to the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . they are in the middle of the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their hab@@ itat and since they always find less pre@@ y .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining Rau@@ b@@ tier in the Kur@@ dish ec@@ os@@ ystem &quot; and the health and th@@ rive of the ec@@ os@@ ystem also depends on that a large prem@@ ise is present .
the chance to see a Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild game is low and performs against zero . when the team found a recording of a big cat in the camera country , R@@ aza ends in pure joy .

in the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o &quot; daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o has been att@@ empt@@ ed to return over the past six years to revi@@ ve the life of them who had risen from the &quot; Trinity cat@@ astrophe , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a atom accident in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a similar pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan . both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami had to experience .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neigh@@ bour con@@ tours Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ il were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had dis@@ appear whole coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima pre@@ f@@ ecture also experienced a nuclear accident , even alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows a local view of which progress has been achieved for six years later to re@@ build the local area .
the comprehensive report of the newspaper articles includes both the statistics of Japanese re@@ gener@@ ators as well as pol@@ l results of the people concerned .
the apartment situation in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of planned subst@@ rate ( in the field , and sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei Ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ at .
the biggest success under the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were able to record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here , 80 percent of the planned subst@@ rate was finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima con@@ stru@@ ed the tail with 70 percent .
even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , one gets even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by accommodation ( the well called the day , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into defin@@ ite replacement houses .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw to be forced to lodge in accommodation .
in December 2016 we still lived with 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima and I@@ w@@ ate in such cases .
nearly 40 per cent of the Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima still lives in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in 2011 . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which were forced to submit more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , were moved to final houses .
for IX , the number is 34 percent here .
the stand of work and daily life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o &apos;s newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by the mis@@ fort@@ une , their doors have been opened up until December 2016 , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing companies in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back into operation , in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , only 30 percent of fishing licence have res@@ umed its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ ic accident , have been large in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ il and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a consequ@@ ence of the nuclear accident , as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , lie in the nuclear isolation zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has fallen back again , but the Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima still remains far back .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ at are back 90 percent of the same stand as before the mis@@ fort@@ une . Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima can represent only 75 percent .
however , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o &apos;s newspaper reports that since the cat@@ astrophe , almost half of the coastal vill@@ agers , it has been more difficult to make their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a total image , the newspaper led numerous survey among the native population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . they asked them about the stand of the re@@ building and even as you feeling on the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among loc@@ als native population .
the survey was that 8@@ 3.1 percent of all local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earth@@ qu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those question@@ ed that still not enough for cat@@ astroph@@ ic prevention .
as it stands for those who had ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also has directed its attention to the position of ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima .
Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima never had to live the trem@@ end@@ ous earth@@ qu@@ akes and dev@@ ast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami that was causing severe , cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ phen@@ ols , atom@@ ic accident caused , atom@@ ic accident suffered from Japan .
nearly 63 000 people from Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima were moved to almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people returned to Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima who have been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent spare parts .
according to the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are known to be more than 50 years old . they are known in proper settings , because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included in the intensive care unit : last Friday a police officer had hit him in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . land@@ es@@ far millions of demonstr@@ ators had a prot@@ ests against as@@ par@@ ity .
Mat@@ eus Ferreira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on Saturday and moved it into an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is considered to be critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which is rapidly spre@@ ading in Brazil within a few days .
on the images , the face of the police officer is also identified with a stro@@ kes . the man was identified as Augusto S@@ amp@@ a@@ io .
after the inc@@ ident , the military police in Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ a@@ io had suspended until completion of the examination of the case of active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he propos@@ es in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Ferreira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
it would be a police officer from a demonstr@@ ators and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be six months long in TV and the entire op@@ pression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ur@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activ@@ ists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video of Lu@@ iz da Luz , divided the video in the net , which one sees how Matcha is attacked by the police officers and hur@@ ry about it shortly there@@ after .
another video with the same scenes , filmed from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks .
the clip shown on the below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus of the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in hospital .

Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which last Friday the police came to demonstr@@ ators past Friday .
police officers sat at prot@@ ests in the centre of Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber sc@@ rap@@ ing and Te@@ ard@@ as .
member of the Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SOL ) , asked the police via loudspeaker announ@@ c@@ ements against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ests were destroyed by foc@@ using on another un@@ expected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically with a cr@@ ushed glass windows to create photo sides illustrations .
however , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a title story with a set @-@ up in a fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ al@@ istic reason to report more about a broken window disc than the prot@@ ests of thousands people who serve in def@@ ending a special cause .
you must also recognize that if you are stri@@ cted against any form of atom@@ ic damage .
even here , the term &quot; Vand@@ alism &quot; a ab@@ sur@@ d , dis@@ propor@@ tional meaning and the typical violence of the military police are supported by the head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police &quot; .

with the introduction of the law of Álvar@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane fabri@@ cs made up the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a ) .
the popular municipality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , is located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ ab@@ equ@@ e , is commonly known as el Central and in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there are no n@@ enn@@ ed sugars on site .
it is two years ago when the activities carried out in the sugar cane .
after the proce@@ eding the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its facilities until just the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding remained of steel and concrete remains .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some succeeded the work .
other re@@ sign@@ atures and pick @-@ up daily to the fac@@ tories , which still m@@ ahlen .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smo@@ ked his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region sugar cane fac@@ tories , which are re@@ active after a long in@@ active time , because they were received .
that was something that was not expected .
NATO rec@@ alls exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , the sugar cane would be preserved , but that promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resistance already the pl@@ agues , the case of soci@@ alism , the low market prices , to bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for wor@@ r@@ ying for the country some decades , but bad har@@ vest@@ ing is no more .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway ste@@ ig of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic need : the 155 sugar cane fac@@ tories were techn@@ ically dated , and hardly competitive , they were un@@ portable for the country .
initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient fac@@ tories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the fac@@ tories , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the mot@@ ives that were related to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased in front of a decade .
from 2017 until 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report by the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutr@@ itional organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go with security in history , &quot; that were the first words of Cu@@ ban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of re@@ structuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , l@@ act@@ resses came from a total of 98 sugar cane fac@@ tories , over 65 million people received their full extent to further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane company Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , he speaks about the closing of the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ d@@ ents are of the same opinion : not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to receive the place , they formed a full time working party .
before the first race year , the first letters came to come .
it was the official documents related to these parts only regarding the parts that would be removed , addres@@ see and the date are distingu@@ ished .
all of them were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any compensation .
because of it the responsibility was over@@ hau@@ led and the letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the remaining sugar cane . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the reti@@ rement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the stand@@ still of the factory at whose construction he helped .
with each part of which he removed , he dis@@ man@@ ned one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industry area of Cuba and most important work split was ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no altern@@ atives for the work and services that were generated in the churches , where they found themselves .
we will never know if the mam@@ mot@@ h state of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw that there were no longer in operation , whose fac@@ tories were not able to run smooth@@ ly .

after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane sugar closed , or better said they started to un@@ ify it , they also listen to asphalt roads , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other fac@@ tories .
they became to spare parts .
without a future , many young people left the region around once .
in the area , a food factory was created , which production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty har@@ vest@@ ing the old soldiers a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in reti@@ rement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and cle@@ ar@@ er voice , is not a trag@@ ic person , but there is no lying , which you told him .
they had him for ten years .
N@@ ene is going to ren@@ dering at 65 years , not because it is missing in power but because it is being dece@@ it@@ ated .

first Nations young people use Hip @-@ Hop to express itself and get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

teen@@ agers from the First Nations Communities in Canada deal with topics which are important for them . they are doing through Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an tour , for 2014 workshop , mobile studio studios will bring directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups s@@ ong@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were guided by David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec to ten Cre@@ e Communities and then collabor@@ ated with Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop enh@@ ances that the young participants in con@@ vers@@ ations , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , con@@ front@@ ation , love , self @-@ concept &quot; or whatever can be found in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular that the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Ne@@ bras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o , in the field of the tribe of the K@@ its@@ um@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of Tr@@ änen , &quot; a road@@ cut in West@@ can@@ ada after almost two do@@ zen were most indi@@ gen@@ ous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not solved largely .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game , how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs of customs is due to glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indi@@ gen@@ ous languages , although the yo@@ ungst@@ ers have not ever master@@ ed the languages of First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation is included , the ref@@ rain will be sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people concerned here received a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly by the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group who became a straw in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ eboo@@ k@@ page by N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the Stro@@ p@@ he is available in terms of translation , as well as translation into English , translated here to German :
sometimes I feel as if none of you are interested in me
but I am trying to go on Earth for my days
that is the day when you will take our cry
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
thus they can grow and forward to our youth .
thus they can do that in what purpose of Creator

in Japan you can see nearly every restaurant plastic dishes .
in order to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are located near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ h@@ san@@ pa@@ u ( the well , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are served by every food that will be served in this restaurant .
customers look forward to these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo District K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a large number of these small companies which produce those plastic dishes , which was documented by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
most of the Japanese are these plastic dishes , so they are not even more striking . however , a new trend trans@@ forms them into ob@@ tr@@ usive mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the Blogger it@@ in@@ ii series issued by social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin .
now in special sale : new with plastic layers decorated cell@@ phones bands , as they are shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some shopping and fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essence is increasing increasingly .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel dish with se@@ afood ) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as cell phone support .
this part we have made for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is a apple , which contains your mobile phone :
designed to look like a apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing approach into the coming .
some mobile phones and mobile designer allow you to make your own art@@ work . in this case ik@@ ura is used or salmon roe , a popular wa@@ opp@@ ing which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubt :
is there som@@ eb@@ ody saying would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decl@@ are my mobile phone with salmon roe ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic layers can also accept a few app@@ et@@ ite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , also it@@ balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and wrist@@ bands from dried salmon .
other dec@@ im@@ si@@ cal plastic lo@@ ung@@ ers can be seen at : it@@ in@@ ii &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 2 . the log@@ is included .
if you like to know more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an in@@ sight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi area , which is devoted to the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .

in reports of reports and foreign media about the not@@ or@@ ious &quot; struggle against drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king in Mexico show up only in statistics . however , this mir@@ rors are not reflected in the extent of the human trag@@ edy that brings the fight with itself .
the coverage of drugs like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the b@@ oss of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , pressed the stories of the conflict in the background .
on the day after a viol@@ ent inc@@ ident there is hardly any one who have learned to live or to live with the pain .
behind every cor@@ pse , behind every bone results in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of count@@ less parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wo@@ unds may never be healed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as :
organised crime makes us not only fear our lives .
the effects are much pro@@ found .
for example , if shops close , because they are threat@@ ened by thre@@ ad@@ ow@@ ers and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometres to get something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; like fear life &quot; ) explains exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is looking for every weekend secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who passed on only one day to her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w .
priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare again today to the task , let us go and go for tom@@ bs after the people who loved we are looking for . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is called Antonio Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need training .
even here is my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no in@@ comes .
you shall ins@@ ist the insurance of my Father , but it does not pay them , because they charge a sterile certificate .
where should we come from it ? &quot;
the ed@@ itors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a Viv@@ ir con el nar@@ co &quot; Expl@@ ain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t have to show the faces of those who are in fear . we must show the international community , the conflic@@ ts and the state guide .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
KY@@ HB , a writer from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
their contribution is remin@@ is@@ cent of us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter in which form it occurs :
I have been with disease and sens@@ ation journ@@ alism now I know for several years now .
I pass the cover pages every day and see the cover pages with images that actually only come from a textbook on cri@@ min@@ ology or from files .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only thing as if I am the only one who resist@@ s or sad . it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be valid or consider it as normal .
it continues :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year @-@ old co@@ us@@ in remember that he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people listen to the off@@ ences of the off@@ ences , if they go through the streets .
for me , it is , as if they have lost ones who have lost som@@ eb@@ ody and those who have fear that it happens too .
I see our weak@@ ness when stories to blo@@ c numbers are in a statistic .
the crime of mankind is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students are justified in a neighbor@@ ing place that they were &quot; upright . &quot;
I think they try to talk , that they spar@@ ed not of such trag@@ e@@ dies when they don &apos;t stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months &quot; ex@@ pressing in the Capital of Capital : like a family with thre@@ ats were pl@@ under@@ ed , until they had de@@ pressed the business of their business until they had not only destroyed the business , but also their family had t@@ orn apart .
you think about everything you lost and about how many people can change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away the trau@@ ma , the fear will come up again , if you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are apart from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want to be arrested others , because they don &apos;t know if they are kid@@ n@@ apped or kill .
I asked myself in these fe@@ ar@@ ful days if I would like to resol@@ ve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to cry . I have to learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence called &quot; generation . &quot;
in the background he thro@@ ws his questions about how he car@@ es about the child of a mis@@ er@@ able woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ik@@ os ?
he is not like the boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bry@@ an is a f@@ ather@@ less and he told how to make himself a egg , potatoes , tender , tortillas warm , and &quot; ch@@ ichi . &quot; this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells about the nine fo@@ ols on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are un@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented for a boy for the whole life made of violence and to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , man told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the blo@@ ody cor@@ pse of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a moving car .
when Bry@@ an was born , the situation looked like in the town of Ju@@ á@@ rez :
Bry@@ an was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mor@@ ality according to the government of government and government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to average 8.5 Mor@@ ds per day .
these are only a few of thousands of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of new lines . this project is remin@@ is@@ cent of those who we are not forgotten .
in addition to the &quot; Apr@@ ender a Viv@@ ir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 created the data re@@ journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data into life , whose goal consists of complex information behind the failed fight against drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , which has tort@@ ured out the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; vom Flick@@ r @-@ User Nik@@ las Viking ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ NING : this article and the pages , which he is linked , include pictures , on which violence is depic@@ ted .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to raise a rum@@ or or counter@@ fe@@ it f@@ ake .
but how did it come up for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or true , tend to stand further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident over seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been used to over@@ throw trag@@ e@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - do not den@@ y the fact that there is abundant r@@ app@@ or@@ r@@ ations about events in the DR Kongo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it ra@@ ises questions about our long@@ ing to pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a tank truck crossed the place S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , n@@ ipp@@ ets around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war in Africa , Africa has been ne@@ gle@@ cted , and thus ra@@ v@@ elled . the streets in the area have become dangerous holes full of percussion and were difficult to drive .
carrying out the tank car to the vic@@ tim .
administration fees are described a fire ball , the do@@ zens of houses included , including a cin@@ em@@ as , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the World Cup .
houses burned and min@@ uted bodies were sc@@ attered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; vom Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photo of the pre@@ ven@@ tive scenes of this day .
above is an example for this .
it shows rows short@@ ened body that are ro@@ wn on the ground while they se@@ w them .
but here the story does not end their end .
over the years the same photograph performed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but certainly not to be attributed to the trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am fighters in Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eyel@@ ets reported dra@@ st@@ ically from Gr@@ äu@@ ble did , before which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and cor@@ b@@ asses were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ acre .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained to count for bodies , &quot; said one inhabitants on Human Rights Watch .
many were destroyed , shot and burned .
only from satellite pictures , the subsequent time could be depic@@ ted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Military Nigeria and the trial of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am had been winning the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture shows the image from the DR Congo as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre in 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false publi@@ city ; Africa check has been docum@@ enting to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was taken as a cover for mass@@ es .
another step further bring personal comments like this example , the picture from the DR Kongo on the sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also occurred in conjunction with the dead@@ ly persec@@ ution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flas@@ k , published by the United Nations , who could escape , r@@ ape , r@@ ape and some t@@ ote , some through burning .
while others reported from the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts as the following on which these descriptions are taken with photos from the DR Kongo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ enda @-@ Arab news page , which said in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars The@@ in had said that mon@@ ks and polit@@ icians had participated in the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Kongo to rev@@ ise this information .
the original fee , which was added on April 26 , 2017 , can be access@@ ed here .
other mess@@ aging organizations , the AF@@ P , as their source , had likewise attributed to the@@ im His statement , but had not taken the picture of the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these wrong cou@@ plings could reach back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come back all over the world .
using a &quot; revers@@ ed image search , &quot; can you see how far data can exceed bound@@ aries .
a revers@@ ed picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures at 18,8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the trendy picture from the DR Kongo .
they come from a mix of private sites , platforms of social media and common publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , others have tried , the for@@ ger@@ ies have tried to escape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several examples that are listed in some cases ( which are included in some cases ) can be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases , which can now be felt completely up ( on the map in orange ) :

the orange countries differ on pages or server , on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fication or false messages are still available .

the picture was swe@@ ating as a cover for the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am mass@@ acre ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with them were taken up in no religious context .

frames and pictures
there are two powerful topics or frames ( sk@@ ins ) that make these posts through . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in regards to greater discussions about silence in connection with the ass@@ ess@@ ments of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Buddh@@ ism .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is evaluated in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to exam@@ ine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a de@@ eper question is what happens if readers can &apos;t don@@ ate this images longer .
with social media , there are thre@@ es@@ core people , acc@@ id@@ ental to carry the water around a trag@@ edy .
sug@@ arc@@ ely this mood dis@@ mis@@ ses the mis@@ ery and false messages that real at@@ ro@@ cities are un@@ true , and that what actually happened in the DR Kongo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of viol@@ ent pictures has been deb@@ ated in detail ( e.g. , for example ) .
a argument is that the re@@ tention of images of a we@@ aving occurs to recognize the trag@@ edy . they are even asked by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern is that certain pictures readers and audience fre@@ si@@ ise them and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which investig@@ ated how viol@@ ent media affect them to help others ) .
while exercising with viol@@ ent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is fact that they are in@@ valuable in today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ olog@@ ists experiment with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will be careful about the situation , in which a picture can be somewhat suggest@@ s , in which a picture can be obtained from the context or completely mis@@ used species .
any investigation of false supplements should also consider how internationally they can .

a blog with the name Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able ( eg@@ . un@@ covered ) tries to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to transl@@ ate at all .
these words are in each language : you can express situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these in@@ separ@@ able words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese suction ) and others who are deeply root@@ ed in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ aked esa ) .
but all res@@ ist , persist@@ ent every experiment a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , so a complete explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand what is meant by a word .
these unique words were already collected in an online list for a whole time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and l@@ ingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on smaller languages .
in the blog you can find words from the Tax@@ ot@@ lap of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Rem@@ aining your parents in recognition of how to sett@@ le yourself in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , as follows :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - The conven@@ ience or sl@@ oth one feels when you have washed in cold days in the sun .
in Birds own words from his blog About :
they kid@@ n@@ ize other cultures , reve@@ al other thought @-@ length and wake our cur@@ ios@@ ity .
sometimes influence how we analyse and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the l@@ ingu@@ ists on this site still want to publish more of this &quot; un@@ transl@@ able &quot; words , as different , valuable and impressive these small languages .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; that are very appreci@@ ated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite songs here .

how Sri Lanka linked to the worst floo@@ ding in the decade
the Sri Lanka &apos;s island refers to the worst floo@@ ding and the cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
at the end of May , by the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 dep@@ ths in the south and west of the country came across the shore .
following a statement by the dis@@ ast@@ ro@@ phy of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing due to the flo@@ ods and s@@ lu@@ dge la@@ wers .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and roughly 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe jour@@ ners .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls left after Saturday ( 27th of May ) , and the waters went slowly back in some areas .
health and hygiene conditions represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still in@@ accessible regions .
the following images and videos provide an impression of the extent of the cat@@ astroph@@ ic flo@@ ods :
flo@@ ods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the impact of the cat@@ astrophe .
even Sri Lanka &apos;s dead@@ ly floo@@ ded the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ der crisis , Save the Children , after further rain falls already on the way .

the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue actions and another five are made available for transport of emergency deliveries in their floo@@ ded villages .
different organizations and start@@ ups have also resol@@ ved to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od VI@@ C@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - information desktop - Sri Lanka provide important information about high water situation and humanit@@ arian aid .
if any search and lif@@ egu@@ ards are needed for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .

the pick@@ access app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , thus the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year , the Pick@@ Me trig@@ gered a &quot; High A@@ id relief &quot; -@@ key , which allowed it users allowed to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up assistance and donations . these were then sent to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
simil@@ arly , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had over thousands of requests and 150 successful boat interaction between flo@@ ods and land@@ slides in a consequ@@ ence .
the combined efforts of the government and of the civ@@ ilian population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as , where multiple social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , bringing people to safety and aff@@ ord relief measures .

the use of gen@@ mig@@ t@@ .D@@ am@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco , with a neigh@@ bour and loving friend .
I tru@@ sted her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts her children : she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we will call you for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ an@@ ians we en@@ code rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrel@@ las and people , some keep the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with a head@@ scarf , bound from a American flag , other sk@@ inn@@ ed slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ ism .
my friend looks at me and says , &quot; These things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; I wonder .
I already have this conversation .
people with whom I have working or people who know me since years - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the broad@@ ened concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built in their concept .
they kid@@ n@@ ize me .
there are 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all equal .
we practice different religion .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different kind . but somehow we will be put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims who do not miss there .
to be missed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is being sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images are in the sense when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I was now , he was an orthodo@@ x@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and sch@@ olar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the center of his poetry .
but religion Rum@@ is was al@@ located in western performance , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists of the represent pictures of Muslims , Western books have already been colon@@ ised for centuries .
this cur@@ led image language is determined by the dark man who should be car@@ ing and the exotic woman who should save .
the pion@@ e@@ ering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Sa@@ id in the 197@@ 0s the story behind these paintings .
but these images are emphas@@ ized today .
we continue to continue our polit@@ icians , the news industry and Hollywood .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how this powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ r@@ ative , our new@@ s@@ fe@@ eds domin@@ ate .
this nar@@ r@@ ative is over@@ sh@@ aded reality that have led to their countries in the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female pre@@ sidential candidate .
this nar@@ r@@ ative , f@@ ails to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are prev@@ ented to bear their head@@ scarf in public buildings , and Saudi women , by their government , are comp@@ elled to cover their entire body , both sides of the same med@@ aille .
a powerful group exerc@@ ises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks like that the first Muslim pra@@ yers were spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers who had been brought with slave .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this nar@@ r@@ ative has been deeply root@@ ed and fl@@ a@@ wed and fl@@ a@@ wed that often S@@ ik @-@ men and children become an@@ tif@@ ici@@ ently an@@ tif@@ ical attacks and ch@@ anc@@ ies .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we don &apos;t tell it , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to handle the nar@@ r@@ ative of 1,7 billion .
and we are failed to account for seven million Muslims who are in the highest level &quot; religious group in America .
more than a third of the whole Muslim population of Africa are African tribes .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immig@@ rants who come from 77 countries .

I am scher@@ ze , we don &apos;t wear all pocket di@@ vers with us .
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &apos; or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim sch@@ ol@@ ars , Muslim activ@@ ists and religious activ@@ ists who stri@@ ve to fight far beyond Islam .
these lies are produced at the running band of a well @-@ stain@@ ed Islam@@ ist glass art@@ illery with money , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already fl@@ a@@ wed pictures of what a Muslim is ; or what is Islam , manip@@ ulation .

I want to explain .
I was born as a Muslims , but a Muslims began to be in my imag@@ ination , when I was four years old , in an provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social studies of religious life , they rely on the following terms : believe , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ors are not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend would see my neigh@@ bour , my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims , when it could look through the 15 metres of concrete and air , which separate our houses .
she would see the imag@@ in@@ able rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I have brought them into my poor , and their Arabian verses have become a guard to defeat the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ula .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I pray that they are protected from evil , the evil one that can see and evil , that one can not see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always a part of my shadow .

the po@@ d@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ bu@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the vir@@ al Vide@@ os@@ eries Secret L@@ ives of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am REA@@ DS , an initiative , multi@@ ply Muslim , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all that makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initi@@ atives , which want to show complex@@ ity and interaction Muslim style .
the col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global benchmark , in which we are .
and that moment has consequences which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that the con@@ spir@@ acy theore@@ tic that existed in the dark corners of the Internet now cause the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ ential because they did not have Muslims too . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; others . &quot;
a few years ago it had not yet been given up ; now they prevail large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m concerned about the real@@ ities and history , as I was so old as I am so old now , but I made my daughter today to an unknown Muslims .
things I have left here like a bread cr@@ ush in my speech .
things that may have rec@@ ol@@ le@@ ctions , because in all the inter@@ sections that makes our humanity a story might be no@@ isy , where som@@ eb@@ ody is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berk@@ ele@@ y , con@@ vers@@ ations will take place in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference to Islamic host@@ ility .
more than an hundred academ@@ ics spoke about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American Mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
these are however not concepts , with whom we usually throw in our schools around us or read it in our newspapers .

all of us have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I say this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Sa@@ id , the man who are shown to us and people through the pro@@ cure of &quot; others &quot; have been revealed by the shooting of the &quot; others &quot; in the Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to keep ourselves un@@ comfortable questions , after the role of that , deli@@ ber@@ ately and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; s March , because the employment that we have no President , where we had no president , while he had broken out countries and &quot; for others , &quot; people already bom@@ bed the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for stor@@ yt@@ elling wants to preserve urban bi@@ odi@@ versity
stories of Flick@@ r users Dan@@ iele Rossi , using the CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a possibility here and now , despite a language bar@@ rier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the stories of stories in their original language a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about an initiative of Steven Bird , the in@@ transl@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language @-@ diversity of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk of which small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the native children .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mort@@ ality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities that have not forgotten the diversity , in which inhabitants must not forget , who they are to be associated .
during &quot; often they are related to understand &quot; understand these events instead &quot; to make listening to feel , to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller tells their story first in their own language and transl@@ ate them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their de@@ vot@@ ion lead to their display , making the list@@ ener on it .
they call laughter and emot@@ ions than the language not longer than a bar@@ rier .
the following video shows example a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this stage , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ si@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate also the opportunity to explain the stor@@ yt@@ elling of the nar@@ r@@ ations of stor@@ yt@@ elling .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the rab@@ bits and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having asked the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; how is that to speak to a audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile he shares his feeling of cl@@ usiv@@ eness :
they have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were quite with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling occurred in three cities , and organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project you can organ@@ ise with T@@ LS in order to organ@@ ise their own stor@@ yt@@ eller .
Puerto Rico calls for the USA new fest@@ iv@@ ity of the debt
with the aim of a new investigation of the public school of Puerto Rico , which has joined 72 million US dollars , involved in a mass demonstration , the Mar@@ sch started in the city building of the capital city , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was pro@@ claimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Aud@@ itor@@ ía de la De@@ uda &quot; ( Civil Front for the Neur@@ ons of the School ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Assembly of Puerto R@@ os .
in addition , the adv@@ oc@@ ate of the deb@@ ts have also filed a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their call :
the people of Puerto R@@ os calls for the polit@@ icians , banks and government agencies , responsible for deb@@ ts , responsible for their corru@@ ption .
we call for financial testing and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public deb@@ ts , with a fixed , our working conditions equivalent re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which are in fav@@ or of economy .
we become ex@@ pres@@ ently and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ c@@ tive R@@ enten@@ payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ of @-@ the territory of the US - suffer from a heavy financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an gover@@ ning independent non @-@ profit organisation with focus on social economic development , a law for citi@@ zen@@ ship , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ os requires a wide re@@ structuring of the state infrastructure .
in case of ex@@ plan@@ ations and convic@@ tion of the citizens risk , the measures will go to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration wor@@ e the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web developer , Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed since a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his suppor@@ ters and relatives made the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions made for an open network .
at this year : publi@@ ca , hosted by the annual conference on digital culture , dedicated to Berlin , dedicated to the event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing books from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ c@@ tive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The Cost@@ s of Freedom : a collective exp@@ iry ) .
the book that was published in the last year and is licensed here , contains a range of articles that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is a hom@@ age to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book would like to work as movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected .
activ@@ ists , artist , designers , designers , researchers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of fre@@ ies knowledge have been involved in order to spend the m@@ ists and make a sense of our new@@ s@@ fe@@ eds and create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have never had any information about his current state or stay .
the introduc@@ tory portion of his book with the title Colle@@ c@@ tive memories gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his liberation and let him go back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how bas@@ sel will pay a high price for his invol@@ vement in a free culture , many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , de@@ eds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we op@@ ted for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time of extreme belie@@ fs ?
the web developer of open source and digital activ@@ ist has been appointed by Syrian government authorities in March 2012 .
in October 2015 , bas@@ sel from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution was transferred to an unknown village .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel informed on the basis of a &quot; strict &quot; é@@ tat command from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
on 12 November 2015 , G@@ ha@@ zi had been cont@@ acted by persons who presented himself as an inside of the Assad government and initiated them with an alleg@@ ed death sentence against her husband .
its where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in that access to the Internet and how to expand public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and pres@@ ently over the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project supported by the Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bas@@ ed cultural prototyp@@ es was looking as the work that he began using a group of archae@@ olog@@ ists and 3D artists around 2005 to con@@ stru@@ ct the ancient ruins of Palm@@ yr@@ as virtual .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way of numerous c@@ ivil@@ izations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Per@@ sian influences .
Bas@@ sel couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would judge all that architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sys@@ WO@@ ens , but in the world .
this strip of digital archae@@ ology and preser@@ vation has created a period of prof@@ essions that will be for public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable .
typically Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my overall life , dre@@ aming of freedom and bases me to embr@@ ace her .
I am over@@ whel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even as he was already in jail .
I have learned to read English well to write and speak English .
he always has his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened my goal to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he has also brought other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without leaving them in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a candidate , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for a year .
she pressed the texts to him , when she visited him , and translated them from Arabic into the English .
the book is available as license @-@ free .
envelope by Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I miss in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
I lose the sp@@ inning in the moment in which we embr@@ ace us ,
that each of the danger is not matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , bonds and trans@@ gres@@ sors
I miss the prison of the prison
and I penet@@ rate every detail of your voice and words .
which I carry with passion for me ,
when your eyes might say something
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring all the moments ,
and to cry out and to smile .
I &apos;m ho@@ ok@@ ing myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bas@@ sel G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
a year goes , my soul
during that period .
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of Monster
Bas@@ ed story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the prot@@ ests against the regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads , there are more than 65@@ .000 people disappeared according to the V@@ Network for Human Rights .
those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime , were tort@@ ured or executed .
since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many more people are unknown .
since 2012 , the Global Vo@@ ices community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel .
we repeat our demand today in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : following corru@@ ption convic@@ ted the director after dis@@ claim@@ ing in previous post
Mos@@ am@@ bik@@ ers responded with anger on a corru@@ ption in which a government member returned to the workplace in order to establish the corru@@ ption .
on this occasion , Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other co @-@ def@@ endants with four other accused ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money origin@@ ated from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice was built between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was fre@@ ed in 2016 because of good leadership and asked for his act to the company , what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the General Assembly of the Republic , which explo@@ ited the application , there was no obst@@ ru@@ dence for Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to his old post@@ ings , as the company had no discipl@@ inary procedures after his imprisonment .
however , many people had not respon@@ d to the action .
the centre for public integr@@ ity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short CIP ) , a local institution that is responsible for public transparency , sentenced to a decision by the German wave to issue the decision :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corru@@ ption and represents lack of transparency and even a set@@ back in regard to the efforts of our legal system , CIP enables the CIP .
as we consider that the company should have a discipl@@ inary process against the tra@@ ff@@ ing would have .
however , the company was silent and causes no reasonable steps to apply the respective functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio Vaz , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considered the case . &quot;
when Cam@@ b@@ aza is a competent guy , it would be advis@@ or to condem@@ n the sentence and half of them .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ e@@ ches , he could advise and his image pol@@ ishing .
but since he is competent , he has acknowle@@ dged to become re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped .
therefore , it &apos;s obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is happy to be for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ aic and student of political science in Brazil , says the director is no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza re@@ wards by the state because he couldn &apos;t believe him that people are rewarded with such a way that the State had already been massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza lack the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but not only by themselves the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand@@ ele under@@ stand@@ able an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is tired of the pre@@ loaded and finally condemned to a long prison sentence .
to be hon@@ est , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te is preferred to remember the prime minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief in prison is :
Die@@ be belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el is not only to be remember@@ ed as the first independent president in memory , but also as sharp , cutting and - side by , prop@@ he@@ tic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , as he en@@ ergetic , &quot; a more hon@@ or@@ able person to be able to sell his amb@@ itions for his amb@@ itions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but it does not turn away from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious person is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were le@@ aning also :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat down 10 years and was released .
and today he put him the company , at which he turns out of money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ Me@@ u@@ Pa@@ is - с@@ т@@ и : + As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ Me@@ u@@ Pa@@ is - с@@ т@@ а@@ т@@ и : ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12th , 2017

Facebook block the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and licensed many users to im@@ pose
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or age @-@ age .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social network took their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people &apos;s ost@@ Indian origin , or generally used as ad@@ jec@@ tive &quot; Indian &quot; .
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the log@@ y ( in bur@@ mes@@ ial font ) as part of an initiative to spread the widespread problem of an enemy in Burma to the social network .
in recent years , the asc@@ en@@ sion of radi@@ cal national movements gave the word a extremely ab@@ sent K@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as an h@@ ill@@ usion against Muslims who depic@@ t a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the way , speech in Myanmar is fighting , the company licensed a lot of mean@@ ing@@ ful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; nowadays really likes to be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself doesn &apos;t call an automatic speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even post@@ ings in which they have discussed the use of the word , or dou@@ b@@ ts of the use of his use , were cen@@ sored .
there are several bur@@ mes@@ ial words with 6 different mean@@ ings , which have the same script@@ ures as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( &apos; age &apos; ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
fac@@ eboo@@ k@@ utzer A@@ ung Ka@@ en explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way , if they would like his back pain , he couldn &apos;t play a pu@@ n .
the phrase la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ isch - res@@ em@@ bles the rac@@ ist , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ IN Win is the opinion that it will decrease speech to radi@@ cal nation@@ alists , but emphas@@ ized that Facebook has become an analy@@ tic , before it with@@ er all post@@ ings caused by susp@@ ected rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it &apos;s fil@@ tering the word automatically .
the Autom@@ at@@ ism will not understand what you write on fac@@ ets .
what it should be done instead , the post is carefully analy@@ ze and control it by ver@@ ify the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age @-@ age ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , speech , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to tri@@ mming their nation@@ alism .
while the action does not send a strong signal to all , speech , like the efficiency of this strategy is not long .
the experiences of social networks in China as S@@ ina femin@@ o and We@@ Chat have proven to use the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of stro@@ kes often a cat and mouse game , where@@ by the user can use social networking , a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the licensed word to express their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ en My@@ at described as Facebook started to er@@ ase his post@@ ings when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished by the social network :
... as I was informed about this new guidel@@ ine by Facebook I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
Iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I left the li@@ ken , post and parts of Content for 24 hours , because the post of the Facebook community does not correspon@@ d to the Facebook community . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts that have no negative in@@ sights , or simply try to show their views against h@@ ill@@ fully radi@@ cal nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy is that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with an enemy :
post without an interview was removed by Facebook .
in the mail the author shared his mind about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundam@@ ent@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more before the initi@@ ation of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese community is asking :
Facebook is a ben@@ evol@@ ent purpose , rac@@ ism in Burma hit by their platform , but it does not work .
such words will focus only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
in addition , it seems to have been forbidden to have this without local context or technical support , as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Er@@ bs@@ enc@@ ur@@ ry &quot; chair .
even when they found out that they did not have made mist@@ akes , they sought not to rec@@ tif@@ y any post@@ pon@@ ed posts .
if only some more respect for the 15 million benefits would have a great turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has provided for a lot of sp@@ ine among the users .
instead of taking serious , users now feel funny and re@@ con@@ sci@@ ously to see the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of h@@ ate language to see whether their posts will be taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post@@ ings , who contained no h@@ unt speech , but still removed :
using permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch refresh@@ ments and watch a Indian film .

screenshot , with approval used .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ al@@ istic ide@@ ologies and religious fundam@@ ent@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their votes and influence .
in addition , speech is to heat up in social networks , in addition to the municip@@ alities in Myanmar in addition , specifically in Rak@@ h@@ ine area where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ism have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was to his failure to critic@@ ise h@@ ill@@ ings on his bur@@ mes@@ ial pages below control .
but instead of just the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to see current , more in context than on the code of concentrated initi@@ atives and learned from them .

a wedding ring in the sand .

the nur@@ ser@@ y is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the State un@@ anim@@ ously decided to offer a law to offer this practice so that the age @-@ effective age is now at 18 .
in fact , in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leaders of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , one group , was gathered to a group of representatives of various religious groups of the country , that the state did not apply to the state , because it was not the maturity of the maturity .
this happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ tual partner of the UN children &apos;s legal intervention , the min@@ ors , as defined as many as 18 years . &quot;
the UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s Statist@@ ical Office confirmed that by 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to the age of 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were dis@@ missed , laws for the nur@@ ser@@ y , followed on the feet and encour@@ aging great support . without doubt it helped to bring this result .
non@@ eth@@ eless , not everything was smooth@@ ly .
a Hind@@ u @-@ guide for e.g. had no concerns to say the crit@@ ics of the child before , they should be wor@@ ried to wor@@ ry about their own business . &quot;
this type of religious opposition was un@@ complicated for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and eventually got any doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill to vote against the nur@@ ser@@ y - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the Opposition and an independent pro@@ found - so that he could be discussed in a representative office , where a simple majority of it would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must vote and she@@ w the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators announced a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram was again posted :
Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of children &apos;s presence in the Re@@ present@@ ative House with 35 votes and not only decided on it .
after having been resol@@ ved at the Senate , the design can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws have been changed to the nur@@ ser@@ y .
Facebook is a member of the Ministry of Education , Lov@@ ell Francis , said :
it has fallen in too much time and un@@ necessary dishes , but you know what ? the nur@@ ser@@ y is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illeg@@ ally , and this is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to play the practice was L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was so happy that the day was finally arrived :

but a possible clip comes in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
prior to months Mah@@ ar@@ aj passed his inten@@ tion to take a ju@@ di@@ cial steps to take the law , and he seems to be his promise .
while the General At@@ tor@@ ney of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , said it is quite law@@ fully if Mah@@ ar@@ aj would like to push the law against the law , the most social media users would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rell shortly before :
dear Sat , if we try to speak instead of the debate , in a way that only pan@@ ic and imm@@ ed@@ ness may say that it might be of great , hard @-@ pl@@ ot@@ ted men that are related to them , would you be ready to dis@@ continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a ju@@ di@@ cial proceedings against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are leg@@ ally legal or even the norm , although there is laws which they may teach .

on Sunday , the office of the Public News came to local News Yar@@ News , that they were h@@ acked .
through the mir@@ rors of Web sites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia @-@ content
the English language Wikipedia page was , on January 18 , 2012 , op@@ posed to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright law in the USA , internationally dar@@ ken@@ ed .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for a month now , Turkey has been interested and popular on the Crow@@ ds@@ ourc@@ ing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV series are against the blo@@ cking .
although many technological pres@@ enced Internet users are usual , use tools for blocked web sites ( a recent article from the New York Times t@@ elling that Turkey has not the third largest dial pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall in this category .
although Turkey has been registered under Wikipedia , since 2008 , as recently in a published report on the Berk@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Har@@ vard University has been held , the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
Turkey is the second most popular country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages ( pages , reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as platform all Turkish Wikipedia sites , which is based on de@@ cent@@ ered pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. machine @-@ machine @-@ machine connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is nevertheless call@@ able despite legal prohib@@ ition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( on the pl@@ ywood from Wikipedia ) , we have replaced it all over them to read snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so , it is possible to read the content on de@@ cent and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ w@@ ik@@ i@@ pe@@ dia.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS was also associated with that this step was independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only available to screen@@ shots and any Live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to host similar mir@@ r@@ or@@ sides , when in the country Wikipedia , is locked .
consult@@ onn@@ i reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and associates at the Moz@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , one mir@@ rors .
one gets to another URL , which is not the original is . that which one sees , is from Wikipedia .
essenti@@ ally , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even when they are blocked in Turkey .
because this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around himself , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly positioned patterns and well @-@ washed colours .
that &apos;s motiv@@ ated him to bear a camera and try to be@@ g the situation .
he was a child back then .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar att@@ empt@@ ed to bring himself on the international stage of Ne@@ p@@ as Tier@@ welt .
and his h@@ omet@@ own right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot images taking attention to Ne@@ p@@ ig wild@@ life .
he described on Facebook , as this prime location helps with his work :
I live at the outskirts of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Parks , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for pas@@ sion@@ ate wild@@ life photograph@@ ers ! !
I just re@@ sted at home , when suddenly Nav@@ ar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Ga@@ ida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist village Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
I immediately ran@@ ged with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father was observed and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began to cr@@ ack pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to acqu@@ ire collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Ne@@ p@@ ig nature and would like to pro@@ sp@@ ate the understanding of that wild animals are not so fe@@ ar@@ sen@@ ing as they look like .
and he should know , because he stood by the presence of his face toward the face of :
a tiger can not be distur@@ b by the opinion of sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was due to the dark in the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush was appeared . he immediately calls us and he star@@ es me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is the &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for Environmental Protection ) .
his passion for the promotion of Ne@@ p@@ als Nature and Wild@@ life is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited for 22 days , and lived in a tent in order to take a tiger for up to 12 days . up to 12 days , it took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live in the vicinity of tourist information .

years after the wedding in Indian women to speak to her husband &apos;s name
women in the small Indian village Bun@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az Kal@@ yan@@ wal@@ a and originally published on video volumes , an award @-@ winning international media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care to speak their husband &apos;s name or even of older men in the family .
instead , use one Pr@@ onom@@ ous or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ iso@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure as well as fear of consequences , they should ab@@ used the norm on life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted from the indi@@ an State O@@ dis@@ ha , by a head@@ court and dis@@ missed by her family and the village community after having taken a married relatives with the name .
the tradition also does not give their wives by name , it is also common among men . however , they have far fewer conc@@ essions to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women played , among them heal@@ thcare personnel , a unique club and thus quickly became a key topic of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they discuss the enemies of Patri@@ archy .
when one of 56 clubs found there in 13 indi@@ an states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is responsible for the degra@@ dation of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children mar@@ ry until the ex@@ ile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected persons , and heads this club .
they reported how this clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time for the amb@@ assador of the wall .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round , hon@@ ed by women who did not call her husband .
she op@@ ted for this topic , because she wanted to open a talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem where women can easily identify the women .
not according to their husband , a custom of her husband is not entitled to maintain the tax@@ able and never question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini c@@ ries :
this tradition has pro@@ claimed that a woman wishes her husband and wishes him long life .
a woman who does not include this is considered dece@@ iv@@ ely , as Mrs. without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply root@@ ed that we have never made thoughts to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to do with her husband so far as he had called himself , at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother in law and my husband are we@@ igh more long after the video was at an end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , saying , I call him from now on his name .
with this self confidence in B@@ aggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ archy &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good cause , because it meant the younger members of a family , especially girls and women are protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to bring the debate with an exercise in ais@@ le .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant , the name of her husband with various feelings of saying - happy , an@@ tif@@ ung@@ ed , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husband , but they can call us as they do , that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day when they had called her husband on her husband , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a century @-@ old tradition , in whom she married wives of her husband .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so sh@@ y that she was only fl@@ aw@@ less during the whole practice ; and another decided to un@@ fold the whole inf@@ lic@@ ation against him and his family by giving him c@@ ursed .
the expression of their faces was ec@@ st@@ atically .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in the ad@@ ren@@ aline , with an ancient bridge , the women decided that they would actually try to name their husband &apos;s name .
and they held their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini to and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother hid her , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less intellig@@ ently and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , as shown in the fore@@ head of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ Red point on the fore@@ head , which shows the sp@@ ous@@ al status :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the cin@@ og@@ as red point , if he also hurt .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped to carry him .
the other women have not completely stopped , but mine , they are now in a better position , even to bear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion of discussion is a safe place to exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip with every discussion of discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make women who hear what could hear , &quot; says she .
in recent months , she celebrated her own bir@@ th@@ days with cake ; they dance and talked about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have worked for some things , such as our identity as our Eh@@ lers , never so hon@@ est .
it feels great to say certain things according to say , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and associated with the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried Sar@@ i for their marriage .
for most , this is okay , but some wanted a sage @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a p@@ ants , they have not dar@@ ed .
after a lot of dis@@ pute and discussion about the ancest@@ ors of his own h@@ anger , the mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , sm@@ ug@@ ged Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) in a discussion round so that women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they can create it .
on the question , if in the five months did something have changed since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming to the ro@@ les :
so far we have done only small steps .
some women tast@@ ed it a few times , but they ce@@ ased to say the name of her husband .
some are included , but only if they are alone and no other family members are present .
only one or two continue to say the names of her husband ; only one or two women contri@@ bute to any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ Red on their fore@@ head .
women in the discussion of discussion know that the changes that they would like to reach them in their lives - like fe@@ as@@ il@@ ibri@@ um or their own h@@ anger - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by decl@@ aring each other self confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how raw ini explains :
each one of us is a vic@@ tim of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club is giving us confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be one chain reaction , if every woman talks in the club and other people talk about what we speak and what we do .
we are all in the same boat .

a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping persons for the organ@@ iz@@ ure , pres@@ um@@ ably for super@@ st@@ itious purpose , troubled the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province of Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government pro@@ claimed a number of operations to life to stop the tac@@ tics .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the District of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ au@@ tho@@ red and found a part of the organs .
two men were arrested and put in the ep@@ is@@ ode that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it &apos;s to pass through local laws that the head of a man &apos;s head of gold revealed or riches , the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive ass@@ aul@@ ts on BE@@ E@@ FI@@ GE men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the goal of killing for ob@@ sc@@ ure is to people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN to investig@@ ate a mission in the South African country in order to exam@@ ine this practice .
the persec@@ ution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbo@@ uring Tanzania , where the government campa@@ igns were fighting , to fight these ab@@ ur@@ ers and pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ces .

PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in death of the dead heads of men .
the persec@@ ution and ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of gl@@ it@@ ants in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has given cultural mot@@ ives and is believed to exist by the traditional Sh@@ aman of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , that would exist as a faith , according to which the sacrifice could have power , the riches .
during the last days three men were murdered in this part of the country .

in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State D@@ id ) , having gained a participation in the design of the Ch@@ arta 08 , a manif@@ esto , which demands the democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , winning the Nobel Peace Prize , and his wife , po@@ et@@ ess Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely balanced .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
un@@ ified Nations
Ze@@ id Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Com@@ mission@@ er for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese offici@@ als to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker remains to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad in a treat abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s President Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende had refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway got into the Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government agreed to do nothing with the decision .
the dipl@@ omatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to take the salmon line to China , as the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the message has spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee gave his hope to un@@ con@@ ditional release and invited Li@@ u to get his prize in Oslo .
because of his arrest , he was not able to take his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate the Li@@ u and his wife immediately to free from home house arrest and to him to exam@@ ine medical support , where he wants .
the leading dipl@@ atin in the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , also called for the Li@@ us release , as in a statement on June 30 , wrote :
we a@@ wait that China ra@@ ises the limit@@ ations of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits , who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans say &apos; him that he is the possibility of treatment abroad in fav@@ or of his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the U.S. em@@ b@@ assy in China , Mary Bet@@ h Pol@@ ley gave up the message of AF@@ P on June 27 that the Embassy to free authorities not only fre@@ t Li@@ u , but his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia free of house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told China that China should offer the following following :
protection and freedom as such as travel and access to medical care of his election , to be entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as the international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kle@@ y and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in order to fre@@ eze the Chinese government , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally fre@@ ed .

Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may be stu@@ pid , since Singapore is recognized as an independent nation as an independent nation .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark was trig@@ gered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the meeting of the international Bran@@ ch Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister of Law@@ yer &apos;s Association defines the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because it Compar@@ ed Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... No one has asked whether New York be a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people go a mistake .
I tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and thoughts to create this precious country , we hear that we were not a country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had to escape an escape from the respon@@ si@@ bilities , a bre@@ ach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended a idea , according to what one could not measure the political system from Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of his , he appeared in@@ consistent .
by contrast , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally as cities that become permanent by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the main focus of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of the rul@@ ers of Mach@@ aze ble@@ w up , leaving the pre@@ ju@@ red logic , because they fit better to their power .
in final effect , the answers were given by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am answers to our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really not answers .
corresponding issues clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers r@@ ational way .
Rachel is att@@ acking Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his opinion because they did not understand this conclusion .
personally I think it &apos;s a bit difficult to go .
if Singapore do not have a country , but a city , which country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be very gr@@ ate@@ ful if our new K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clar@@ ify this point if he was high paid to be part of the government of Singapore .
by clicking on his comment on the blog , he says to read about the crit@@ ics that you should start to read the whole manusc@@ ript of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; in the context of the testimony of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the cap@@ tion .
when he said that Singapore was more a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ easy , even if we are enjoying ourselves free and just cho@@ ices .
it was in Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities we saw a party ? ) .
as he said , Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously not meant to be in this mind !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment via Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes a leader of a her@@ al@@ growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore is saying that ...
at least I didn &apos;t know with Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old Gar@@ de - which I did not agree with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have dou@@ b@@ ts and I am not even sure whether he &apos;s true , right and conscious of what he def@@ ended .
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am Arg@@ um@@ ents :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; committed a mistake , or was it a mis@@ cre@@ ator ?
if Singapore is no country , we are considered an independent and superior state ?
if not , what country do the so@@ vereign rights of town come back to Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the govern@@ ance inet@@ ts , the testimony of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am is of serious importance .
why aff@@ ord carr@@ urer of their military service , but they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay off our Prime Minister b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the Journey Journey of a Dec@@ ade comm@@ ends to the aff@@ ir@@ mation of Singapore and was always a town :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have many buff@@ ers more expensive ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear something like &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite correct .
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked about recently his ed@@ itors : what is the most ab@@ used aspect of your home or hom@@ eland ?
your answers are published here as a part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ ets should be shown .
the latest part of this series origin@@ ates from Ne@@ vin Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most provided to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , then I am . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite , interest in its meeting partner by asking personal questions .
at my clar@@ ification the standard response is usually followed by the standard response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadian war@@ nings may cook for Americans , but if they are kept for Americans , but do not distur@@ b me .
for anyone who is not familiar , there is little to distingu@@ ish the Canadian war@@ adi@@ ers of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadian flag grow well visible on their back@@ pack when travelling .
everybody loves can@@ adi@@ ers .
American , however ... .
so it was already when I began travelling 20 years ago to travel through the world - in front of Donald Tr@@ ump , before going to Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian has always carried small map@@ le leaves to their baggage to distingu@@ ish themselves from their American neighbo@@ urs .
we have a free heal@@ thcare !
there are no weapons for us !
gender @-@ sex E@@ hen has been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant Land of ethnic groups .
we are not such as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I h@@ ate that .
first@@ ly , I have many American friends who I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would make me nothing if you would be conf@@ used to listen to Johnny from Dallas by mail .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , &quot; kind &quot; means &quot; is to be called &quot; kind &quot; says in essence - as the br@@ illi@@ es , gentle , but trag@@ ic figure N@@ ed Flanders , &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; kind &quot; does not make personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing but to@@ ast each other .
harm@@ less is to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to make no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around one around .
I would even be able to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main igen@@ etic of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own business .
what an err@@ or@@ standing as &quot; kind &quot; may just be just cool courtesy .
Canadian , no often talk about the fence with the neighbo@@ urs .
we lack the warm heart@@ y , open friend@@ liness , which I now connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Just@@ in Tru@@ deau got the stage to show that Canadian war@@ adi@@ ers are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada straight .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ c Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that was par@@ odi@@ zed by the jun@@ ta and re@@ produce the power in 2014 and continued to restore the civil government .
the new song &quot; dict@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band tattoo Colour disc@@ usses a young man who tells him who makes his girl@@ friend with him .
although not ex@@ press@@ ly polit@@ ically , the musical video still refers to the persist@@ ent military dom@@ ination of Jun@@ ta .
the band was pra@@ ised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video loaded on Facebook was divided into 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 likes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; has been blocked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ists reached the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpre@@ ted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to Thai politics as it is concerned with the country &apos;s position under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these images of the video that rel@@ ate to some of the political issues that have worked hard in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may rel@@ ate to the wi@@ per section 44 of the preliminary const@@ itution which gran@@ ts the com@@ mander of the Supreme Court of decision about important national issues .
11 . rule : &quot; change your setting &quot; refers to the not@@ or@@ ious program &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activ@@ ists , polit@@ icians and other persons who are considered crit@@ ics by the Jun@@ ta as crit@@ ics .
the picture above reflec@@ ts the introduction of the law on compu@@ ter@@ cri@@ min@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by authorities to negoti@@ ate activ@@ ists and other crit@@ ics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army has also been organized and commun@@ ic@@ ating on the online content and persons , in which mon@@ archy is rejected .
Thailand lies a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ estic land ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was pro@@ claimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that said Jun@@ ta is still trac@@ ed to purchase their decision in U boats , though security experts they war@@ ned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax tra@@ ders .
in the video it is even shown how people can be thrown into a black delivery van before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly ro@@ wed &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threat@@ ened by long sent@@ ences , they should ins@@ ul@@ ge the mon@@ archy .
meanwhile the teas@@ er of the songs of the band , which im@@ it@@ ated the sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; was already used by p@@ utsch oppon@@ ents during prot@@ ests in 2014 .

the post@@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Georg@@ ian @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the Northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinc@@ tive images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon @-@ pool of Ab@@ le @-@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Gre@@ eks , Sk@@ ar@@ ians , Georg@@ ian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together for Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , mostly Rus@@ sians and bats are living in the area .
such sett@@ le@@ ments are also called ghost town in Ab@@ le @-@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these cler@@ ks .
this phen@@ omen@@ on is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the Province of 16.000 people had barely increased after a decade .
in 1989 , about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation , and it falls to him hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why don &apos;t talk ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens which served all the community .
now there are only pav@@ ed road with remaining spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
people who once lived at this place and present their contribution to the central @-@ plan of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the cl@@ erg@@ y town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ us@@ cht@@ sch@@ ow@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , one can recognize the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look at the window of a destroyed house .
when you discover me with the camera in your hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us , let us take a photo , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ency ( cultivation of scenic products for personal use ) such as liv@@ est@@ ock hus@@ band@@ ry and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to come across the laps .

about ten years ago , an old woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , how it is called in the neighbour@@ hood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dj@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .

Gal@@ ina wants no financial help from her daughter and har@@ ass@@ ed that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a fruit garden nor a house , it is difficult to survive &quot; because they are .

&quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if you are staying , we are visiting us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bour is released on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; you said , we could prepare zu@@ cchini .
I already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build their zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; one can get used to anything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as con@@ vers@@ ation@@ ist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children living in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
it remin@@ ds us of the village every day .
despite the relatives , who live in the Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ at@@ asia was simply away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of dark street or a few people .
one can get used to anything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
indeed , it has always something to do with pill@@ abilities .
after the war there was hardly work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation occurs at the end , a little boy is running on us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed house and h@@ ides .
a ball is flying from the window and a other guy behind him .
he plays with the ball , which then leaves the hill .
a group of children pursu@@ ing the ball now .
while they run , throw some of them stones on the falling buildings .

this article by Amy Brack@@ en was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and published here with kind permission .
along the way of mig@@ rants that crossing Europe or Latin America , certain locations will be known for their hospitality .
I attended one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is situated on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a little woman with a cor@@ als @-@ purple diamond frame and gold colored rings in ted@@ dy bears shape .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ est@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) became a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar / night sleep in single rooms , cr@@ ushed threads , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is one par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel yet , hundreds of African and Hawai@@ ian mig@@ rants come here .
sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come in full min@@ ib@@ uses and from the upper part of the coast to call it : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it &apos;s more quiet but in this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept even outside on boxes .
she wants to re@@ ject any@@ body .
they also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys medicines you can not pay them , they are mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that cre@@ sted from long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ ique Sebast@@ iao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ iao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ urt camp ) is posing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came to Brazil from Angola and ho@@ ping to go to Boston .

&quot; Yes , ye@@ ah , &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits that African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ iao travels with his sister , ho@@ pes to arrive to Boston where you can find her husband and the three children .
you have already been living in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans on the way to the United States , to make a first stop in South America and then moved towards the north .
the family had heard of other att@@ endant family from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name , &quot; explains Felix Mich@@ elet , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often traveling together and that Afri@@ cans can speak on Wh@@ ats@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companion , Mich@@ elet lived previously in Brazil and worked as a building worker for building the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest in Mama Africa . he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our m@@ um and we never let them go again &quot; says he sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her that her guests are often broadcast tex@@ ture once they are gone to gre@@ et you or to report about the course of their trip .
it explains that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare ch@@ ick@@ ens as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps known here , but it is not the only spar@@ row hope for mig@@ rants that travel through Tap@@ est@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family mig@@ rants in their small house .
it is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus ticket to be sold to numerous African mig@@ rants .
he began to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the ground floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and cooking outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests make .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they do .
I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after three years he lived in the United States , after he had lived for three years .
the majority of mig@@ rants that travels through Tap@@ est@@ ula , comes from Central America , other people open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail the money , without having a plan .
in tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for a vacation rental and a unknown , a single @-@ known one has offered him the roof .
a few months later the family lives and they tried to decide where the next steps will go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the streets you can consult their tele@@ phones .
a min@@ ibus arrived today and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nost@@ alg@@ ic , because of those who went away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she loves her album with numerous pictures .
there is one of her daughter with African hair car@@ esses that you made a cli@@ ent@@ ine , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travel@@ ers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she briefly imag@@ ines her .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ eron , &quot; they are repeated every time . &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ in@@ jiang inhabitants will be forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones .
check @-@ in for personal communication devices in X@@ in@@ land of Twitter users ( SU@@ M@@ SAA ) .
the residents of X@@ in@@ jiang , ethnic minority in China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi gives a mobile phone notification in which they install the district government named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the communication , it is said that the app will go to access terror@@ ist information . &quot;
but , however , the authorities can also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terror@@ ism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed the app after they had installed the App with a private We@@ Chat Group .
in the communication of the police , the app would determine the sources and distribution of terror@@ ists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective utility with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fr@@ aud , Troj@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users swe@@ ating how much time they are online and to remote control your home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions may naturally be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; government actors or even h@@ acker capable to manip@@ ulate the home network of a person , or ste@@ al it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while mil@@ it@@ ations about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , the reality is very often d@@ azz@@ ar for those who live in dist@@ ant ethnic minority regions like X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet .
to limit im@@ rest and dis@@ satis@@ faction in conflict regions , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ or@@ ters and surveillance measures as well as regular Internet circuits .
on Twitter @-@ based Media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( the day ) published in China published , showed pictures from a Check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen of the crowd apart if they had installed the surveillance app .
the agencies in X@@ inj@@ ian represent sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they can be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
you have forced to use people who are intended for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tive through English transmission technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( the well ) Account Manager , published in addition , is a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which allows the software to fix a Windows operating system and thus achieves un@@ restricted access to your computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ in@@ jiang will become electronic papers .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly cause a reaction to the instructions of the city @-@ party , to minim@@ ize the pre@@ val@@ ence of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new surveillance methods :
in X@@ in@@ jiang , the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi an ordin@@ ance with the instruction to all the inhabitants and entre@@ pren@@ eurs , to 1 August , their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable disks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this action is in@@ ju@@ red to identify and destroy , however , the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a whole number of other possible fare , among them that rel@@ ate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : it &apos;s all about death
a single cell in Old Dubai , Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane was put into his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world look at you and sett@@ le that you are alone on a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dis@@ band@@ ed and revealed a truth un@@ recognis@@ able , both inside and outside .
one who makes her name all glory .
one that has settled down into a list of feelings and ex@@ pres@@ sions that do not allow Met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality pic@@ ks up again and you look behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes and the per@@ former - transform the characters into beings from meat and blood , and everything went after death .
all dou@@ b@@ ts dis@@ solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth is caught on the axis of the evil . you will surely be caught here between the walls , and your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they have arrested me and my father th@@ rice , but I didn &apos;t want to learn &quot; my lesson &quot; as the chief of Security Service , &quot; as the b@@ oss of Security Service , that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he gave his power to proof , destro@@ ying even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five teen@@ agers have been t@@ orn in a peaceful prot@@ ests like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was filed , that the city broke down the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; .
all city quarter rose up , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , without having false time , even if I had no high demands to a city , which is up to the ar@@ ter@@ ies of government meetings and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night , things were something cal@@ ms after the power supply had stopped in the quarter .
I broke out the silence , by taking several times &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; by my house roof .
I heard my voice resist@@ s through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt bra@@ ve enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends just decided ; we were kind@@ led to a beautiful picture , which my expectations filled and full .
in such a moment , you are aware that you fre@@ ed the spirit from the lamp , but it &apos;s not interested in the od@@ ing@@ est .
I received a call from my father : &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you could go down - nothing can give you your voice after you gave it all the way to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me listen as you &apos;re &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &apos; or you &apos;re only bra@@ ve enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ ill@@ ful eyes performed on me .
&quot; and you really dare to look at the sight of my sight and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old and it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , perhaps on the revolution .
I was so sure of my thing as I said , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I believe I have never heard you to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I re@@ gre@@ t no word of what I said .
&quot; and put him in sol@@ itary and his father with them . &quot;
&quot; to his father like with them . &quot;
the tank of this g@@ ursed pro@@ position lies with me today in the nose .
he was a &quot; syndrome , &quot; an aff@@ ical torture , which I was suspended in months .
I am thr@@ ill the farm .
at the first office , I leave everything back with me .
after that , through the yard and into the second office , this leads through a cor@@ ridor to the single cells .
I agree to me all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise , in spite of this time , they probably have achieved a larger cell .
I must share it with only one other pris@@ oner , and may cause me to wait without permission .
after a few minutes , the offici@@ als felt like a whole life , the offici@@ als left the cell , and I grab@@ bed on an old tried communication method : beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell was &quot; A@@ sth@@ . &quot;
after a long term , he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a rep@@ utable man middle age that looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , there are no prominent fac@@ ial extrac@@ ts , and doctors are not here ; we are all the numbers of numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice like my sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers to one of its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ su@@ res me , they would stay free when I stay .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have had a birds of birds to distri@@ bute all these cr@@ acks , which are lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head .
at the distance I still hear &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; from the distance .
it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always in order to kill these time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens up .
I was always convinced that Black saw the color of the wh@@ ale , until I saw the yellow light looking for us . Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er &quot; , att@@ ending to the 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
to protect the mystery in order to protect the so@@ vere@@ ign@@ ty and terror@@ ists in us , they tru@@ sted in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ty dial@@ ect - thus they played in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ty dial@@ ect - and so they played the close eye on its world view .
this is not a house , that is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to turn the cri@@ min@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a her@@ oes .
I enter the hearing and meet Abu Im@@ ad , a sl@@ ender and sl@@ ur@@ nal man ; at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I didn &apos;t get used to answer it .
I really cannot say exactly anymore when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches are become a friendly interview for me to an ordinary communication equipment .
when and what happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to sp@@ oil myself worthy of being pun@@ ished , though I had done nothing to make this pun@@ ishment .
at sentence in all its variety .
its command is to rip so much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your friend agre@@ es to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cry .
my c@@ ries still won &apos;t enough , so that they ex@@ changed the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had been working as a gar@@ bage collector , or if it belonged to the normal employment .
they had four cables in a row to present ourselves from their perspective , a great invention of a huge cab@@ al .
within a single hour , three of them looked after I was still in line .
I had lost any sense in my body - and also my voice , why I heard it off .
the head@@ sman perce@@ ives the cooling and has no pleasure in it so that it had an up@@ loaded st@@ iff rod .
electricity through my whole body , enough to store my entire area .
my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground was the perfect grid director .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay me sleeping again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the space &quot; .@@ Re@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ f@@ ick@@ er . &quot;
I am answering with the voice of a tired young people : &quot; my lord , my father must wor@@ ry about fe@@ ar@@ ful wor@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and go you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had released .
where do they guide me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LG@@ BT Q + community , free opinion and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib exp@@ ires the most of his time ; let us drop to his computer , times to his computer , and again to his couch .
what if one can leave , there is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his car@@ ot@@ ine fl@@ aked lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which was part of them since 1967 ; and H@@ da@@ ib@@ s family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where they had lived out of her village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmer ) .
since six years H@@ da@@ ib is a pas@@ sion@@ ate activ@@ ist , who asks the conserv@@ ative majority , and their old opinions about GI@@ CH@@ LE@@ CH@@ TER@@ RO@@ LL@@ EN , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rap@@ idity .
with his music , often involving themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian po@@ ison , however , demands not only to the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues can not only be found in its home town of Amman Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities , from Damascus in Y@@ emen to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen .
with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib sees himself as a man who is not limited in his thinking , and he can suffer from his own failure to suffer from the dev@@ ast@@ ating consequences of foreign inter@@ ven@@ tions in countries such as Iraq , Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya .
even if it does not distri@@ bute it open@@ ly , he propos@@ es a special inc@@ lin@@ ation to US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib ob@@ serves his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib won &apos;t believe that his symp@@ athy for those who try to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian po@@ inting of the second generation , even if he was born in Jordan , so far has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own lives , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ da@@ ib . &quot;
then adds : &quot; I think so as I am a man , &quot; while living in water sol@@ uble N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in that time it is planned for Muslims from sunrise to sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ an law say that the public intake of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an illeg@@ ally .
obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weak@@ ness for it , to break with ancient traditions . another cup of coffee has a little of coffee at a sufficient hot Jun@@ it@@ ag a little with protest against Islam .
generally speaking the gap lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the flo@@ ads of the K@@ ent c@@ ig@@ ars in the nose in first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky above all , especially if you throw a look into the neighbo@@ uring countries .
it is so easy to avoid to do basic things - how to drink in public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water , to land not in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said to have a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , already for the second time .
some debate , which support the Islamic Action front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Br@@ other@@ hood - arg@@ um@@ ented that the sexual orientation of hom@@ osex@@ ual fron@@ ts have contra@@ di@@ ct the cultural and traditional standards of the country , and the main reason for the concert is .
the MP@@ s and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic co@@ alition of Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the ICTR .
many pret@@ end to claim that the band &apos;s invol@@ vement in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free opinion in the Arab world , the ancient approved leg@@ itim@@ acy author@@ it@@ arian reg@@ imes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila rated the j@@ ord@@ an people as the progressive suppor@@ ters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use &quot; for intel@@ lec@@ tual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not just simple rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a clear anti @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ying reality reflected in Jordan was clearly reflected in H@@ da@@ ib@@ s plant .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib set traditional gender norm@@ s to ab@@ ide by which he formed his vision of the fate of Arabian women that had vo@@ iced sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously unknown woman whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ umer@@ able women who have lost their lives through the hands of them , they should have confidence .
over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of Hon@@ our de Hon@@ or - the in@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch Group said that the number of Hon@@ our de Hon@@ our in 2016 reached its zen@@ ith ; however , Jordan was missing the inst@@ itutional infrastructure to support the victims of moral or domestic violence .
according to a law on the spread @-@ fighting from 1954 , women who are forced to be det@@ ained at any time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a lon@@ ge@@ ological bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee of the family needed that the woman will be nothing happen .
also H@@ da@@ ib@@ s music enjoys great popular@@ ity and is well @-@ known to look back on the subject of topics that are long as tab@@ u g@@ old in his country .
H@@ da@@ ib was polit@@ ically mel@@ ted that his work is polit@@ ically mel@@ ted , but it is full of explic@@ it concerns on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not of politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
he was log@@ ged in politics , &quot; he says .
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ ib takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; will focus again on poverty .
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically polit@@ ically engaged .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse was repeated :
&quot; you are free , and anyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a art market where one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , h@@ eter@@ o- or hom@@ osexu@@ ality .
he noticed that any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of p@@ iles and readers and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT Q + individuals were still cen@@ sored by 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ ib was an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme Ro@@ ya to realize that his comments was t@@ orn in the context , rot@@ ates and been cen@@ sored by his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but only one worked version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ da@@ ib acqu@@ ires open to the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that In@@ toler@@ ances were not spre@@ ading against hom@@ osexu@@ als .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ de , a poet who remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ ib asked : if Abu Nu@@ de could work that later on behalf of the calendar should work open@@ ly about hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can Jordan not know that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila or the fact that the concert has been cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service comm@@ enced several former government deleg@@ ates and members of the teacher , with the reas@@ oning , they would have expressed himself on comments in social media that merged with the deep in the land .
according to its opinion , the concert H@@ da@@ ib@@ s is according to the very tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to consider a structural re@@ think in the next generation of Jordan .
for him , progress has been a permanent g@@ ent and take @-@ away Jordan to the second time in a row , but the way of progress - is made from slow , re@@ mind and inner@@ vation changes . it is sure that these changes from day to day is taking place in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anic society .
finally H@@ da@@ ib was dre@@ aming , like millions other Arab@@ s also , from a Arab world without inter@@ ven@@ tions abroad .
it is not only dre@@ aming , his work will bring up to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to do them . &quot;
perhaps the region is called by music , art and literature of a real and fundamental fre@@ op@@ enn@@ ess - and not by bom@@ bs , stre@@ et@@ itions and on artificial art . at least he ho@@ pes that .
as far as far , H@@ da@@ ib is for@@ ging and thus resist@@ s resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war dol@@ ls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origins of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of death , that the land@@ ed and the dancing came across more than one thousand years , in the arm@@ ies of Japan , in order to force the indi@@ gen@@ ous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the kne@@ es .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to sn@@ ip a few great seats , so we have a super view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( verb@@ tl . ) .
I have long been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fest@@ iv@@ ans are straight on .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori to itself , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only tru@@ thful - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high car was amazing .
let us enjoy the summer !

rarely were external appearance and body care so important as in this history , because they help him to keep the per@@ u@@ vian youth from the crime and a leg@@ itim@@ ate prof@@ ession such as the Fr@@ ise@@ urs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , located near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drugs are everyday .
one in April 2017 , the survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population does not feel conf@@ ident .
at the same time , Peru - like many other medi@@ um@@ - and South American countries - increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance , and therefore also the unusual hair@@ dos of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , with Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that demonstr@@ ate this up hair style .
the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go on the ultimate limits of imag@@ ination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts stand along with each other to show who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric lo@@ cos as you can see in the following video ( see further videos for current competitions this on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions just like the school Augusto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who were in El Call@@ ao , found there a chance to con@@ vince the weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work in the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
motiv@@ ated from this activity and the adv@@ ancing possibilities have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can gain a prof@@ ession , which is currently in fashion .
before the school year before the school year , the school offered special training workshops and reported about some of their achie@@ vements :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the bor@@ ough of which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have established this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ äm@@ pfer

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the version of the contribution &quot; lovers to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ äm@@ pfer , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this paper will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who know we ?
is it not much more import@@ antly , people who feel g@@ ated to receive aff@@ ection ?
this question was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the &apos; Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation . ( letters to reconc@@ ili@@ ation ) , the young people encour@@ ages the letters to write Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ ä@@ mp@@ ner &apos;s letters .
only recently , her country was a place of historical events , and they wanted to contri@@ bute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with Guer@@ illi@@ abe@@ tic F@@ ARC ( german : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of the Col@@ umb@@ iens ) , which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was the name of the peace agreement as the result of peace that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
however , there is a long way in front of colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ism , until one can speak of real reconc@@ ili@@ ation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ äm@@ pfer , who were lived for many years in illegal camps , and around the clock had tru@@ sted their weapons with their arms , to integr@@ ate himself into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society once again , who had acc@@ ust@@ om@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases de@@ eper against gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ä@@ mp@@ af@@ ers , it must now support them in their ranks and construc@@ ting it a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that young colum@@ bi@@ ans would have to join together and help the integration process .
and they just did so : until now they have written thousands of young people letters - love stories to former Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ äm@@ pfer to welcome them back in the company .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former Guer@@ ri@@ v@@ äm@@ pfer - who will be handed over personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconc@@ ili@@ ation was created on the world summit of Peace Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who we love to write thousands of love letters , but those forgotten they need much .
he plan his way he talked about to share his love with people who needed the most urg@@ ent p@@ ru@@ ch .
so the plan was created , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who will now have to build their place in society and to do a new life , to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , say it .
more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kol@@ umb@@ iens such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ al , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos; I never thought that someone would be for@@ given . &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 , which was transferred to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students of the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ art travel@@ ed to the camp to bring letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC stood up as they used to op@@ pose to the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters of sub@@ mission of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from fear to luck , and everything that is between . &quot; he told the political science student Manuela Jim@@ éne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ or of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , this unforgettable experience is :
after having committed the letters , a former soldier led me through the Guer@@ illa fighter camp .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the Guer@@ ri@@ ak@@ äm@@ pfer live ) saw , I saw a Guer@@ ri@@ ak@@ äm@@ pfer , who wrote a bit .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ gran@@ ular designer , a dead@@ ly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
and I said to him , &quot; Hello , what do they just doing ? &quot; he said , &quot; I am answering a letter which someone was written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone has written me something so nice , so let me ask . &quot; and suddenly the te@@ ars went over the che@@ eks .
I h@@ ug@@ ged him on him , and set me beside the gar@@ net designer .
perhaps he was sorry , and was sorry to be all the years of loy@@ al compan@@ ions to his fighter and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . himself was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that anyone would have for@@ given me to my mist@@ akes .
but now I know that there is a society without an open arms waiting for us .
until now I learned only how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in di@@ gn@@ ity . &quot;
new voices
students came to join students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC at a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as war ruled and the F@@ ARC already ruled in the bor@@ dered .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC wave the history of organisation , their ide@@ als and sight into their views over the peace process . now , where we have the possibility to develop us to create a political party , we can contri@@ bute to the company in that country .
for an objective of this size , it is worth@@ while to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said .
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people , who had never heard animals , and no electoral law had ever seen and even h@@ ate , even people with beautiful feelings , who were shot by their hab@@ itat and the environment , was very pain@@ ful for me .
reality , in which the country lives , is wo@@ unded to me .
but it comfor@@ ts me that all men - also who have killed , and so much damage have to give us something , and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the Commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letters :
colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was made to rule , that would rule peace after the dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is in@@ equality , h@@ unger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons ; and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now put on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they hear , talking about all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord to our contribution , and bring offer@@ ings , because we know from their own experience that nothing is easy . they are among us who defend life as the basis of existence , are many difficulties before .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them .
a trans@@ formers speaks about the persec@@ ut@@ ations in Che@@ chn@@ ya and lives in Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s life

hom@@ osex@@ ual and Que@@ ere people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dang@@ ers - including dis@@ cri@@ mination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ pressing .
activ@@ ists have activ@@ ists the coverage of the last months over the persec@@ ution of pregnant women in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the thre@@ at that depends like a roof@@ s of LG@@ BT@@ Q community , is not only about overnight .
OC Media rated the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y that talked with us some of her experience and talked about what is happening in the republic .
many months the LG@@ BT in Che@@ chn@@ ya in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines , after reports were published that the to@@ wing , torture and pot@@ ence sque@@ eze men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ et@@ iti@@ an authorities , susp@@ ected of susp@@ ects and they placed in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ formers , was born in Gro@@ z@@ y and raised up there .
she has felt a woman in reality thanks to her childhood .
when she was grown , her aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so that she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens had experienced their land@@ lady , the h@@ unt was founded back to Sabrina .
she was afraid of fear for her life in the United States .
Sabrina : I was working on a volunte@@ er company in a human rights organization .
one day , someone was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ formers who put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her to hes@@ itate .
while I tried to help her to help him , he thought he would be a friend of my documents and spread all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . so he sent no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya who can elim@@ inate these shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made me by the whole Wh@@ ats@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing that I had a few shopping bags of my car &apos;s back , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around myself , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time on a bar@@ k : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you make a shame ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke the last En@@ des in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything along and started to cry .
the man was flow@@ n .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two head@@ ings in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary .
OC Media : what hospital have you been placed - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is my male name , but the doctor , and lay me down to the women .
I am very gr@@ ate@@ ful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his side@@ car , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am gr@@ ate@@ ful to him that he respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got dr@@ ones .
they cried to me , back to me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbo@@ urs and some remote relatives .
they requested to return to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they earned ab@@ sur@@ d demands : some said , I must record it without going through the streets , and others knew that I had not changed my sex at Gro@@ z@@ y that I had not changed my sex , and Photos@@ hop .
I &apos;ve wit@@ ness@@ ed bas@@ kets size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people once again spoke my mother at the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster into the world , not only your family , but the whole republic is ash@@ amed .
we cannot stir up because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must dis@@ appear from here . &quot;
my mother became much too much , and she laid down a Stri@@ ck to his neck .
lu@@ ck@@ ily the neigh@@ b@@ ors went and saved them .
at the time I had to switch to the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window discs and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ auf .
after it happened for the third time it was clear that since something was la@@ zy .
my human rights un@@ checked friends checked the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you flow@@ n ?
Sabrina : with the help of activ@@ ists .
for security reasons , I will not give her name , but I will say that I am rem@@ ind@@ ed of all remember ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then happened something un@@ belie@@ vable .
I still cannot realize how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it , without registration , without passport , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and she cast them into the gar@@ bage .
came to and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by Wh@@ ats@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you did not believe in safety , just because you have left the country ?
our people know already in which Hotel du F@@ st . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the sex@@ ually observ@@ ations , this is a t@@ orn theme .
some traditional cas@@ cade elements carry me still in me .
so I can &apos;t want to overcome this bar@@ rier bar@@ rier .
I am always saying that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I truly give me trouble as the person remin@@ ds of her past - thus in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed in ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to som@@ eb@@ ody who did eat a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an could not have been arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
so that I mean , they may charge the relationship with the affected person and at the end request a proof of that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ bing .
OC Media : are now also g@@ ay men involved in these secret things ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there &apos;s no much for me .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives or those of their relatives have been left to put on Kad@@ y@@ rows trial .
as far as I know , they will be recorded there later as terror@@ ists .
say : if they are killed , they will show up their bodies by television , they would have attacked your village or a military base .
are you understand ?
as if these people had not van@@ ished , but specifically sub@@ merged to radi@@ ate himself .
OC Media : is this only a gu@@ ess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I trem@@ ble just someone who was im@@ pris@@ oned in Ar@@ gun in a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after being grown by Bart .
there has been nothing new of them since .
they simply took them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself counted when these people were taken .
however , until now they were not introduced as a band , there have yet no reports . we ass@@ ume that such actions are possible .
why else would you not allowed this man to sh@@ ave ?
do you know if these fol@@ lowers and demonstr@@ ations of people who heard a so @-@ called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sabrina : I still wor@@ e my hair long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already familiar to Gro@@ z@@ ny when I lived there - and I had never had problems .
serious ! in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was g@@ old , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much saf@@ er than now .
Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; c@@ ivil@@ ization &quot; in the end of us , but finally back into the stone age .
OC Media : what is it possible with the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were t@@ amed ; I had dy@@ ed eyelashes , carried all tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the safety department of the Sh@@ aria never stopped me a hair .
before the Russian Theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where there were several b@@ än@@ ke , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people .
we were never har@@ med up .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a re@@ use : K@@ hard@@ a ma K@@ hard@@ a . that is called &quot; Sp@@ otte not on the mis@@ fort@@ une of another . &quot;
it is often said to learn children when the sick of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply have her eyes closed before you because they believed , they were sick ?
Sabrina : Yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me , never j@@ agt and never cr@@ ushed .
OC Media : how long held this p@@ ig time ?
Sabrina : so long to Kad@@ y@@ rov to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking on TV about mor@@ ality .
he did not speak about us , but priority over the behavior of women .
but still - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
who had to be laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once with arg@@ on .
in time , I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was ste@@ adily slow@@ ed down .
OC Media : what activities are you planning to work now ?
Sabrina : I work as wa@@ iter .
I earned no much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
I &apos;ve always been working as a activ@@ ist as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gath@@ ering , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t have to pay a cent .
I discovered these people myself , when I lam@@ inated a refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : carry out an Hid@@ s@@ go ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
that is how nature , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens can ver@@ ify you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no one of them .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which have the Kab@@ ard@@ ines who have the Rus@@ sians are also known ; but on the whole planet it is - but not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s un@@ pleasant to hear something .
here I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - Do Muslims who go into the mos@@ que and fast@@ ing in Ram@@ ad@@ an , live together with men .
you know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity to men who love them and believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience . but this is a tear .
these are two different things - two different ways of sens@@ ation to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ash@@ amed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I am so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of su@@ mor@@ ality within the hidden Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the I@@ ran@@ ian ancestor region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arabian population .
since the last few months , there has been a strong increase of su@@ icide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with approval .
the self @-@ combustion of a man named Jas@@ si@@ m Mor@@ am@@ az@@ i , on August 27 , the situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ community in Iran was character@@ ised by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight .
Mor@@ am@@ az@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the ancest@@ ral region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered by anx@@ i@@ ety , de@@ pression , and he was ash@@ amed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to come up in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights are working in ancest@@ ors and remain anonymous .
a video made on YouTube kept the moments after he had ten@@ dered himself .
some people managed to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ am@@ az@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ u hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide who has occurred within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority in August , and activ@@ ists ahead of the site that even more men could take life .
the An@@ c@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights informed that this month some other - Ham@@ id Man@@ i@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mo@@ us@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have been app@@ ended .
their stories are together , together : we were all family @-@ v@@ ä@@ ter that were hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ able because of the persec@@ ution of the I@@ ran@@ ian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ able to feed their families .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment , and dis@@ cri@@ mination
the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis which makes it difficult to dis@@ pute their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a pre@@ domin@@ antly autonomous region in Iran , until the p@@ ile avi mon@@ archy took over power and took great efforts in 1925 to stop eth@@ ical autonom@@ y all over Iran .
in the Ah@@ aj@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran to present oil and gas fields as well as some of the most effective and valuable useful areas for the I@@ ran@@ ian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is developing only slowly , and the native population does only get a little of this wealth .
it is often vic@@ tim of untreated diseases , h@@ unger and dis@@ cover@@ ies .
the I@@ ran@@ ian regime is denied by Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ ians in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a multitude of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas in the Per@@ sian territ@@ ories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are caused .
these dam@@ s have led only to destroy the destruction caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ yo@@ ungst@@ ers now rose to 81 % .

a &quot; system@@ atic strategy ... that aim to destroy the mind of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ imi , an I@@ ran@@ ian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist ethnic dis@@ cri@@ mination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of su@@ icide under the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Doh@@ imi had said that especially the unemployment has become worse than it is a combination of a high number of ancest@@ ors in Ah@@ aj@@ z , and an anti @-@ Arab dis@@ cri@@ mination in the setting process :
because offici@@ als and institutions does not pre@@ fers Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is preferred by access to working possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a system@@ atic policy of ruling reg@@ imes , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to force her living out of their hom@@ eland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and sur@@ name to get their affili@@ ation at Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , since even Arabic name will not be toler@@ ated by the workplace , because the speaking of Arabic language or the carrying arab@@ ic clothes .
in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i should have to adop@@ t human rights activ@@ ists , before the situation explo@@ sively .
it remains to be waiting for whether the world is awak@@ ening and knowledge .

&quot; why I do not identify with F@@ emin@@ ism , also with the internal fr@@ action . &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement made by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , and originally published on the section Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . this article was subject of several discussions , where many different positions were expressed .
they can be found in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who deal themselves as an interactive femin@@ ists - with fru@@ str@@ ation .
they wonder why I am not a part of movement .
they even think well thought out scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be F@@ emin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money despite the same formation .
that women still stand under strict observ@@ ance , when it comes to you what they are doing with her body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards are still ens@@ uring that women so@@ oner or later in various fields of life to a glass ceiling , and that dis@@ cri@@ mination based on gender still moves across the many different countries and religious directions .
all of this is conscious and known .
I am convinced that I am double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I have to speak on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I have already been ab@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white internal femin@@ ists .
but nevertheless they all agree together that women - all women - come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an inst@@ itutional form of rac@@ ist , which we are exposed to black women .
or about that black women and women other eth@@ n@@ ias and her@@ esy sor@@ row earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with mig@@ rant background of the school are proven to be white girls because of obvious integration problems .
or that women suffer from a higher risk to suffer from a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership to suffer as white women .
at that time , I want to have all women , all men and all the same rights . in other hand , I can not join me as a black woman , in whose centre is the white woman who refused to consider in@@ justice in their thinking , which rel@@ ate to both the sex and to the skin colour of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and I will not fight my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spher@@ es , which always rep@@ ented me and count@@ less other black women .
in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; I am not a wife ? &quot; and I also ref@@ use to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alis@@ ing essence .
I ref@@ use to complete me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs to push their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will not try to draw more importance the importance of hyper@@ colour and sex . for some of them still continue to avoid the importance of black women to femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them a better .
although the Inter@@ action F@@ emin@@ ism was founded to spend women of more bar@@ gains a home and re@@ bo@@ ating from the white F@@ emin@@ ism , &quot; still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I draw it before me to dis@@ connect me and all of femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as woman in life , instead of me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persist@@ ent as a new phen@@ omen@@ on is celebrated .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and give us to the spher@@ es which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the Book of Africa : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves , in which it may be completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped .
although some white and interactive femin@@ ists are immediately call , after they have read these lines , please inform about the hyp@@ oc@@ ris@@ y and contra@@ di@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a bl@@ ur@@ red environment , I can feel black women and women other cultures because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized by my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this Para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flower in a environment that is neither over , nor ig@@ no@@ red , yet ign@@ ore .
pad@@ dle against the so@@ iling : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about international efforts to resol@@ ve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
always back to Nab@@ il Mus@@ a in the past 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special request by the region of Kur@@ dist@@ an in Iraq . its mission is aimed to deli@@ ber@@ ate the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key , we will follow Mus@@ a , who explained his relationship to the rivers of the region and the influence of pollution in his commun@@ e .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river , which we lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust @-@ absor@@ bing , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - which is responsible for it to protect the rivers , stre@@ ams and water@@ ways in Iraq as well as to support the local communities in sustainable use of this natural resource . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the urg@@ ency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced by Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key , a documentary film@@ maker and multi @-@ media journalist , edited and published in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the main emphasis of its work lies on the subject , sever@@ ely sub@@ cultures and is character@@ ised by using k@@ oo@@ per@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques that can tell their stories to their way .
Paraguay , women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the short@@ ened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ sky . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( Slo@@ ich@@ ein@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , which reports about the level of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protecting people affected .
a police officer said Ad@@ a B@@ á@@ ez , said it &apos;s nothing to Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who could have been active towards us .
since the end of her relationship was over time and the police said , her testimony would not be put to the files , but more could not be done .
as another woman , Bal@@ bu@@ ena was showing because of abuse , benef@@ icial also the real display of Ad@@ a B@@ á@@ ez .
a few days later , the second woman re@@ treated their ad .
to break the vic@@ ious circle of violence against women , is difficult .
if women are busy at all , they did not get support of the state in general .
in many cases , the women dependent on men are dependent on the men , who do not abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who are ad@@ mit , victims of violence should be reported in the prosec@@ ut@@ ational authorities .
persist@@ ent imp@@ acts and statistics for statistical abuse and legal system that nothing under@@ ne@@ imm@@ unity of Paraguay : good approach , viol@@ ent implementation pun@@ ches and statistics
it is difficult to identify how many women are really har@@ ass@@ ed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , Res@@ ear@@ cher for Ac@@ ross the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a soci@@ alist research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various details and reports that are not even pres@@ um@@ ably based violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
but the numbers available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District Prosec@@ ution filed 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . at 70 % of them it went to violence against women .
86 % of advertising the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in peace studies . 86 % of women of women came from here .
in the ads , 40 % of women that they were physi@@ cally har@@ ass@@ ed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics are however not showing the true magn@@ itude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian women Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi will actually appear only a few of these criminal off@@ ences . &quot; every woman being ref@@ unded to Paraguay because of psychological abuse , are 9 women who do not do this .
for every woman , being ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s su@@ icide in Paraguay is no way of an off@@ ence , the persec@@ ution authorities can not be registered as many women each year of their current or former partners .
between August and August 2016 journalists were at least 12 cases of su@@ icide in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay has been documented with at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died because of violence .

invisible abuse and a rule system that does not under@@ take
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm girl@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he noted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning she did not wanted to re@@ gre@@ t her , but she was forever re@@ gre@@ t .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but for two years she brought the psych@@ ic violence amongst them - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time .
I never thought that I would have a vic@@ tim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I thought that only women happens to be sub@@ jected because they let themselves down by viol@@ ent males .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described their ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two years of relationship , and told how he had isolated .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to be a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen so long from Carlos and left him before .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , who is not from Paraguay , was fighting for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner was har@@ ass@@ ed .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) which consists of women who are all in any way sacrifice of abuse .
in the group they can talk with others about their experience , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the say@@ ings of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tor@@ ias case , everything began with psychological abuse .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner eventually managed to con@@ vince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tor@@ ias returned by the authorities without result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against its former partner who developed into a per@@ me@@ able jur@@ ist struggle between Paraguay and her home country where it mainly went around money , power and influence of its former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not to be applied .
the ad@@ vert of abuse is a path of resist@@ ances and a fight against corru@@ ption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ aur@@ i , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ y ) on 10 August 2016 .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ single ) are part of a campaign on Twitter operated by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law is planning to explain the Fem@@ iz@@ id to an independent off@@ ences and har@@ der to pen@@ se like it already in the neighbo@@ uring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the law@@ ful text was modified in some point to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law so that the way for dis@@ cri@@ mination of abor@@ tions may be b@@ other@@ ed , which are currently forbidden in Paraguay and may be pun@@ ished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill was fore@@ seen , the most of the ( bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process costs which have to bear the victims of violence , even if they just want to keep an ad &apos;s place , to re@@ tain the state .
Ech@@ aur@@ i ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator does not provide adequate funds to provide :
in Paraguay , missionary is seen as part of human relation@@ ships .
a re@@ membr@@ ance must take place here , that violence is no longer considered to be a bit normal .
w@@ ho@@ ever is silent in the face of that facts , making the offen@@ ders gone away .
we have to do so long ad@@ vert , until rate of abuse is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before that , the Law of the law had been modified , which was called a passage of a passage in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconc@@ ili@@ ation was seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor , his victims re@@ tire .
however , a cancellation of the words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is considered to be a big set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper still exposed attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a resolution of the information Minister , &quot; says Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s homepage .
more than a year ago , the Korean authorities reported the independent Arab journal Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corru@@ ption in the sult@@ ant .
Y@@ ous@@ ef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the ed@@ itors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he has served a prison sentence .
two other ed@@ itors from Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put on court , but came later again .
Oman has been gover@@ ned by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n Sa@@ id , who came to power after he had his father , Sa@@ id ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the principal officer in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , chief of the War , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council , and President of the Central Bank .
the rul@@ ers of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by most har@@ b@@ ous efforts , not@@ ified of domestic fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restri@@ ction and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ ger and other activ@@ ists , to be im@@ min@@ ate and im@@ pris@@ oned .
the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and leg@@ itim@@ ate activities in human rights system@@ atically and activ@@ ist citizens , including corru@@ ption on the public affairs of the country like Cor@@ ruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closing time and det@@ en@@ tion three of her ed@@ itors last year is a hard blow for the freedom of the press .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corru@@ ption in Oman since its inc@@ eption in 2007 ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was b@@ anned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , following the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the ju@@ di@@ ment and the inter@@ ference of high @-@ ranking offici@@ als in ju@@ di@@ cial decisions .
in the report government offici@@ als def@@ ended , judges of the Supreme Court in Oman has put under pressure to raise a verdict in a pe@@ a .

on 3 August 2016 , Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Au@@ dit Committee , was transferred to the Special Department at his arrival and at his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew the Deputy Editor , Y@@ ous@@ ef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had been acting as Chief Editor in Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed down in an un@@ certain period after the Information Office had announced that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , will be b@@ anned from 9th August 2016 .
on 26 September 2016 , the first session of the trial against al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ cat .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned among others for dis@@ order of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; revi@@ val of the State of State . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ation of a public sphere and the le@@ ase .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of arrest and monetary charges in the amount of 3,000 om@@ ani@@ ac@@ ial R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was condemned to a year of prison and fine fine of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) , having found the use of an information network for spre@@ ading material that might be a danger for public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ bian ri@@ ial ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set to be released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court pron@@ oun@@ ced Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 and sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the prison sentence of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central prison sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he f@@ aded his old prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also put the resolution of the Ministry of Information , the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s decision , the newspaper sees itself out in terms of attacks by the om@@ an@@ ical government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information adopted a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was renewed for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister took up another time against the decision of the Appe@@ als Chamber to re@@ pro@@ claim the publication of the newspaper .
the and@@ ru@@ dence of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been in@@ ju@@ red in Oman in Oman .
for example , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to show up .
due to the forced closure of Az@@ am@@ n and det@@ en@@ tion of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Korean authorities are still not ready to prepare a comprehensive injury to the press .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Chinese authorities :
1 . Y@@ ous@@ ef Al @-@ Ha@@ j tempor@@ arily rele@@ asing and un@@ con@@ ditional release ;
2 . a safe environment for the newspaper az@@ am@@ n can be created so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect the Press freedom in the land and
4 . in order to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman dre@@ ad their leg@@ itim@@ ate human rights and inter@@ act without fear of re@@ activity , including ju@@ di@@ cial Sch@@ ik@@ anas .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ govern@@ mental organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( even independent journalist , blo@@ g@@ ger , lawyers , etc . ) in the ad@@ joining United States and to the right to gather peac@@ efully and to give them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely cheap or even mentioned in the media , which addresses the growing needs of the continent addressed to one of the most urg@@ ent needs .
for the demands on @-@ site medical research there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have widespread more serious impact than elsewhere , and lack investment for expl@@ oring this diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big issue .
second@@ ly , research , which is conducted by African scientists , is able to establish its own research content in Africa . major role of science and technology can only be convey@@ ed to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Zentrum for Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia ( CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic revealed first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself worked on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to supporting the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discuss the future of medical research in Zambia and mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings about this research .
( dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I also support the sam@@ b@@ ial national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just star@@ ved a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ og@@ ens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion the most important research themes in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
that must change , otherwise we will always keep the recip@@ ient instead of being M@@ acher .
solutions that we get , are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it &apos;s impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : the US and Europe .
the projects are funded by differ@@ ently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine work which you did not before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have continuous power with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it lasts months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need of special academic education , starting in each age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , expl@@ oring the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientists in Africa based on your experience ?
RW : often there are a limited speed , things to do , and to obtain access to scientific expertise that shows challenges .
the system that journ@@ als are only available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited to the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : like &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers , world @-@ wide food production will change
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has bred already in the USA for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 species , such as out@@ sourcing , the first plant , which have been cultivated and consumed by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only 20 years long , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was given only by its own income and the question as many sal@@ ats@@ as he can get across bound@@ aries .
but in the early 2000@@ s he noticed that more sal@@ ads was patented and that he could not continue to re@@ treat them .
the pat@@ ents have not only valid for individual types , but also for certain characteristics , such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ - or bl@@ iss@@ ed leaves .
in recent years more such pat@@ ents have been applied to more plants including grain or boxes of money . due to this trends , plant care , environmental prot@@ ector and experts make food security for the future of food production .
as a pas@@ sion@@ ate representative of a mill@@ enn@@ ia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still has let@@ tuce , he needs longer than ever since his work is still going to be more restri@@ ctions .
&quot; it is , as would be a rock in a river , in order to pad@@ dle .
so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these pat@@ ents go on sal@@ ads .
and when it with@@ stand before judgment , no one can breed a new Sal@@ ats@@ orte , because all features are patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to listen to those features he wants .
however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intel@@ lec@@ tual property .
he has also joined a movement , which is always t@@ aller in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have bred red tube salad of the variety out@@ sourcing in the &quot; green@@ ery &quot; of the station . there it is being tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ inc@@ idence that this name sounds rather so sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ Source &quot; -@@ seed ) can be inspired by the motion for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternative to copyright protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and gen@@ es are not protected as spiritual property , and can be used perman@@ ently for plant@@ ing plants .
within the framework of the initiative , for short O@@ SSI , U.S. bre@@ e@@ ders may be oblig@@ ated to be able to freely use it from them .
however , it does not mean that they can &apos;t do business with their seed . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders allow others to cross it in order to breed their own seed , and not instant it - two aspects which are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ents or pre @-@ written .
do@@ zens of gro@@ wer and seed companies have already been joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
dark pro@@ spects
Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in Mad@@ ison and O@@ SSI board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed @-@ good and the possibility to grow new plants as well as for environmental protection as well as for environmental protection .
Sa@@ at@@ well plays him a role in bigger gath@@ ering such as bi@@ odi@@ versity , rights of farmers , control on food levels and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ e@@ ders would try to use the latter or only little to run by means of seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ izes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , gra@@ ins , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic agriculture or not . &quot; who is offered good , locally and sustainable producing vegetables , should also know that the way is bred to itself as such as this vegetables are cultivated , threat@@ ened .

the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to provide others , their seed is still free to make it in contrast , seed and plant features to be patented .

O@@ ss@@ i sub@@ si@@ z@@ ers argue that the future of food supply has been end@@ ang@@ ered because the available gen@@ pool is on plant material due to the always count@@ down intel@@ lec@@ tual property rights to plant material that is thus limited to restri@@ cts .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Executive director of O@@ SSI , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation of carrots and their availability . it found that around one @-@ third of all car@@ rot features is protected as a lec@@ tual property , which means it can either be used for plant bre@@ e@@ ders .
for other plants , there are still no estimates such as Lu@@ by suggest@@ s that mass@@ aging plants as wheat in even bigger style are patented as let@@ tuce or carrots .
a question of sight@@ ings
plants are cultivated so that they prove their undes@@ ir@@ able features - from such , their taste or her color improves their own taste to such , because of which they pro@@ sp@@ er in certain environments such as Pest or diseases .
oppon@@ ents of pat@@ ents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ e@@ ders through more pat@@ ents increases . genetic vari@@ ability now is more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are predic@@ table by climate change much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto is important that genetic vari@@ ability is important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four official banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Agriculture of the United States , the company register for preser@@ vation of genetic vari@@ ability .
however , she contra@@ di@@ ct that spiritual property has to promote other bre@@ e@@ ders , since &quot; pat@@ ents and protection of plant vari@@ et@@ aker innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is taken into essence , once you can follow , once the patent has expired .
often , these statements help others to come with another method of the same result .
thus , such protection does not inhib@@ it innovations , but promotes the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks like the different : 20 years to wait until a patent is certainly no innovations .
and if you are waiting for a long wait , to grow on plants , which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , we have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is however that genetic resources were always been an all @-@ meant and remains said : &quot; independent plant bre@@ e@@ ders have neither the time nor the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ us inc@@ en@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to facilit@@ ate farmers to work .
this is what makes us sh@@ aw@@ less and it will not be impossible for us if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
a total of all , Mort@@ on is distur@@ bed to the concept of making plant features : &quot; we do not create the features of themselves .
the plants form them itself and as bre@@ e@@ ders , we ultim@@ ately do no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol De@@ ppe , plant bre@@ eds in the US state of Oregon and O@@ SSI board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who covers a variety and bred his own values into them .
those who believe in the industrial farming with large pati@@ os and mon@@ ocul@@ tures , are cultivated by her@@ bic@@ ide in its cultiv@@ ars of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is just gene@@ alog@@ y . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) pat@@ ents , do not re@@ ject them the patented starting or they hold it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the high @-@ quality Frank Mort@@ on &apos;s plant looks for Sal@@ ads in his breed .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that breeding is more innovative through the avo@@ ids of plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like that I can produce up with my efforts , stronger than company , the patented .
&quot; I need new stuff for my catalogue , since I know that my oppon@@ ents are sold out my s@@ orts in a few years itself , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent is worth 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it very nice easy for me . &quot; worldwide response
although the United States seem to be leading the U.S. in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept is spre@@ ading itself rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources , the center of farmers re@@ loc@@ ates the center with farmers and helping them to grow new varieties that meet specific requirements .
it also supports you to get &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ e is working on an open @-@ source &quot; license which ultim@@ ately represents a formal and leg@@ ally binding form of the O@@ SSI @-@ oblig@@ ation for bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for the bre@@ edings differ from country to country , not simply one can pay one in Europe or other parts of the world in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the Executive Board of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that the conventional cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it says against the current practice of the European Patent Office , pat@@ ents on conventional cultivated plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is to governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , based on the farmers , non @-@ govern@@ mental organisation and seed companies from all over East @-@ Africa , to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and global trend towards the storage of seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for h@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; promot@@ ions , that the organisation currently com@@ men@@ ce a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seeds , scheduled to drop the official start date next year .
a merger between environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international Non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and Conc@@ entr@@ ation Group ) has compiled a database for seed and bi@@ odi@@ versity around the world , to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map to publish .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , which is a global alliance for the future of food - a group of relief organisations such as CH@@ P Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , which means that farmers will have to carry out seed , and to improve seed , to ensure that a stable supply can be ensu@@ red .
in the report also the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ized - a connection between the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI ho@@ pes that soon more people will be recognized .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has been given above all that and how something is grown , and sa@@ at@@ es@@ es have hardly played a role , so lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to con@@ quer the people more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still trying to unlock the contents on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekends of the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government shut the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents the human rights viol@@ ations in Egypt , as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it c@@ anned the Egyptian authorities for this step closer and promised the work and efforts of human rights in the area .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ble@@ ib@@ t- despite this attack and the const@@ itution of the Egyptian law and the const@@ itution of the Egyptian right to defend it . even if it has never been so difficult to overcome this targets , so it was not so important that all technical possibilities arise , to overcome the blo@@ cking and dis@@ playing our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 web pages , like b@@ sp@@ w. the independent news site MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabian language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al Ja@@ ze@@ era for alleg@@ ed &quot; Support of Terr@@ orism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to Egypt on the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
zi@@ ada used to use his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he does not writes in Egypt for any web pages and media .
now the blog has been set up in order to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government , the aim of a attack .
Blogger , the provider of which the Zi@@ adas blog is home , however , it is accessible .
zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by the Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student prot@@ ests , such as the police force physical violence against two students .
his articles are mostly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , zi@@ ada had op@@ ted to the obst@@ ru@@ ction by the government and reflected what this means :
the blo@@ gs , blo@@ gs , is very old , but has been given in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ cking of the blo@@ gs may not be mean@@ ing@@ ful for the world , it is yet for two reasons :
1 ) It has succeeded in contrac@@ ting the sense of a si@@ ege of si@@ ege ; an att@@ empt@@ ed murder , a su@@ al murder , summ@@ ing up the national security Council , blo@@ cking blo@@ gs , and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not know in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a little audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first , I used to post a post of articles to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ age@@ ous go the way up to an end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities shut down technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , among others orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the locking of suppliers , through the change of inter@@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday 12 June , we felt like the re@@ jection of web sites , which had to offer V@@ PN@@ s .
such a practice indicates the inten@@ tion of the government to block and fil@@ tering the contents on the Egyptian user might have access .
the situation will additionally be deter@@ ior@@ ated , that the c@@ ens@@ uring key is taken behind closed doors , where@@ by the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using them from court against those actions .
now the question ar@@ ises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro in the war ?
the residents spread .

day for day report newspapers in Brazil with a dark head@@ lines from Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro , the second largest city in the land and home of numerous postcard mot@@ ifs .
some of these lines are waiting as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was killed in school , &quot; &quot; Every day a police officer in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro was ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ated with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends the troops of the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis , the financial situation in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian NGO organization Global Justice called even the United Nations to adop@@ t the United Nations .
reports such as these are daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , Editorial , published as &quot; Extra &quot; on the 16th of August , published in Rio , &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in whom she pre@@ ached , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motive for their decision explained the paper so :
extra will continue to tell more about crimes that happen in every big city around the world as murder , pre@@ b , sexual crime , etc . everything that happened from the c@@ ivil@@ ised standard . ( ... ) This is our way to call &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , that we could not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty as journalists .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor &apos;s editor that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country which does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro 8@@ 43 areas , there are members of criminal organizations .
in the Editorial writing the newspaper writes the newspapers :
for us , deli@@ ber@@ ately is that a war course , if he is dist@@ orted to be used , sk@@ ill@@ nesses of the police which first becomes wrong , and then asks questions to destroy .
but we defend the war based on information and struggle against corru@@ ption in the police , whose purpose is not the civ@@ ilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; sub@@ mitt@@ ing more than them ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliveira is ar@@ gu@@ ed to prove the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this was their opinion a just@@ ification of security policy for the media and might be wor@@ shipped to ac@@ company respon@@ si@@ bilities .
this is not war .
this is the result of corru@@ ption and bad planning - as extra in the analysis of the military staff in Rio itself - in combination with un@@ belie@@ vable investment in staff , re@@ figuration and historical and sel@@ f@@ tive neg@@ li@@ gence of the public service .
to remember@@ ing : the state of Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro is bigger than its capital .

according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro is the most viol@@ ent city in Brazil , according to the statistics of 2015 , according to the statistics of 2015 , according to statistics from 2015 on the north and north @-@ east of the country .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro .
when we look at the toll rates in the state , Rio is located 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra belongs to the Glo@@ bo company , the largest media company South America , which is emphas@@ ized as Cec@@ í@@ lia , who has been the security policy of the state since years .
in 2003 , the establishment of the Up@@ p ( Un@@ id@@ ade de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pac@@ ific@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , is one of the police unit , whose aim is to con@@ quer the deployment of a massive police car and establish a force perman@@ ently there .
initially , this resulted in a decrease of viol@@ ent deaths . since several years up@@ ward , the up@@ p had to protect against Sch@@ ik@@ anas and pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the ne@@ edy police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quot@@ ed from one of his articles from 2010 , where he explains why violence in Rio not declared - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the Rio as war also attrac@@ ts severe consequences for people .
because this calls for the state to asser@@ t the state , the means that a c@@ ivil@@ ization is typical for a war . with which a c@@ ivil@@ ization is a cru@@ cif@@ ul point in the landscape and for the object for &quot; coll@@ ision damage &quot; and &quot; tri@@ mm@@ ed balls . &quot;
war or her that fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer from Rio .
a week now is that the police com@@ prise the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all these violence also this inc@@ ident happened : an orch@@ ard died as a result of shots , who fired the police from a hel@@ oc@@ op@@ ter .

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syri@@ ans , mushrooms .

source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , and in the subsequent civil war suffer many Syrian cities , among loy@@ al forces and loy@@ als , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Institute PA@@ X and the instit@@ utes of The Syria Institute , are in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , De@@ ir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib at present about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is especially strongly affected where an attack on 21 August 2013 caused an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organisations and Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investig@@ ations of the United Nations and other human rights organization that the mass@@ acre of the Assad regime was admin@@ istered .
since 2013 these areas have been distur@@ bed by re@@ bel controlled areas outside Damascus , which led to that inhabitants died , or by tunnel and control points of forged foods .
by the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanit@@ arian aid and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can im@@ plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; vi@@ able food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ se@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i are not part of the standard , planted in Syria and are only extremely rarely part of Syrian cuisine . her food price does not make them an attractive food source for many local residents of the besie@@ ged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
to the order of the French News Agency , Nab@@ il , the subscription to the French News Agency , said :
&quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutr@@ itional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Le@@ ila , one of the organ@@ izers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been strug@@ gling for three years , making this project known and pressed his relief out that it now wins more and more &quot; in popular@@ ity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the humanit@@ arian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ se@@ da .
it is planned to sell 125 families of knowledge about plant@@ ing fung@@ i , such as Dr. Le@@ ila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 million , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do between 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on gener@@ ators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel bench , locally made fuel used are used in order to provide the gener@@ ators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Le@@ ila said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; production from the regions of the fung@@ al seeds , before they checked up their quality , and they are suitable for consumption .
then they plant a small mushroom in a tub . when this was accomplished , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they designed a &quot; teaching farm for the region . &quot;
since the start of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. Le@@ ila declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach the human fung@@ us for various reasons &quot; : fr@@ action of si@@ ege .
provision of a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ catering , using food resi@@ due ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) can be used for extrac@@ ting new foo@@ d@@ stuff .
creation of new jobs , particularly for women who work home .
creation of new jobs for people with dis@@ abilities , which are tied to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against the h@@ unger and si@@ ege is visible .
we want to insp@@ ire our experience people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portug@@ ese demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people had prot@@ ested in Portugal and compete for the victims of fi@@ res in Portugal , and challenging justice for the victims of fi@@ res in the north of Portugal .
two and two were killed , and about 70 were in@@ ju@@ red during the forest fi@@ res of 15 to 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fi@@ res were registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ works that spread out in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , the town of Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande is a similar trag@@ edy where it was produced by the fi@@ res of 64 deaths and more than 200 convic@@ tions .
according to European Forest monitoring system , which super@@ vised the forest areas by satellite photos , are only about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest alone in Portugal - an area of the area of Lisbon alone .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 distri@@ cts .

the obvious trag@@ edy
the aim of the prot@@ ests of Saturday was demand for better pre@@ ven@@ tive and fire fighting action by the state .
people asked why c@@ ivil@@ izations have not been able to com@@ fy the extent of trag@@ edy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al made from the Con@@ feder@@ ation of Portugal in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão houses and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not did this now@@ here : there are du@@ ous reports of open streets , which were besie@@ ged by fire .
in the forest of Le@@ iri@@ a , a similar trag@@ edy would happen again as in June , since the streets were locked very late . &quot;

the journey from refugees from Afghanistan to successful entre@@ pren@@ eurs

during a night in autumn 1994 , the conqu@@ est of Afghanistan began through the Tal@@ ib@@ an .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a land of ter@@ ror and des@@ pair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Af@@ gh@@ an for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother said it not at that time , she knew that she wouldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the to@@ ppers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara , who had been murdered by Tal@@ ib@@ an , and many Haz@@ ara were immediately felt .
the Tal@@ ib@@ an &apos;s famous for their hat@@ red came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after the run , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy , and made him sick .
then he assumed that was left of his low sal@@ ary , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ons with mort@@ ars , who were heavy as he himself to earn his life .
at that time , the life of Af@@ gh@@ an refugees came from El@@ end and explo@@ itation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; I remember@@ ed herself in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site , which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we suspended nylon in front of the open windows , that we did not refresh@@ ed at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe .
at the dangerous crossing on the sea suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum claims , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ k was hom@@ eless , run alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who separated twice a day food .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers as a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true also that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are to be found in the country , cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the Civil Rights Organization &quot; Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffer from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special admission centers &quot; in the hands of impro@@ vised and un@@ qualified staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers could only be assigned for asylum , if they have officially registered an application for asylum , which is able to pass after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , have either been attracted to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
so it came to A@@ shar@@ k .
but his un@@ belie@@ vable live will help A@@ shar@@ k soon to free from these conditions .
after several years of construction work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k won his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a bu@@ bble .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ at@@ is Suc@@ cess Story is now part of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venice ) - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wah@@ idi .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entre@@ pren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Ital@@ ians - are very difficult .
much bure@@ au@@ cr@@ acy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Af@@ gh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution in other European countries .
in recent years some of Af@@ gh@@ an operated company produced , among them tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Af@@ gh@@ an restaurants have even been pra@@ ised in the Italian media for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of its restaurant Orient Experience in which the K@@ ell@@ ner and the kitchen staff mostly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant runs through the various Af@@ gh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of its journey to Italy .
the Af@@ gh@@ an entre@@ pren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ iz@@ zeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Af@@ gh@@ an .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to go far beyond the Italian food industry and retail trade , and aim back to the land that he was forced to leave for teen@@ agers .
&quot; where a risk is , possibilities &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my land and I can &apos;t feel happy when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the country &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest provinces , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k also plans to learn plans for opening a factory in Kabul , which can sell packing and preser@@ vation techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he says .
the development to successful entre@@ pren@@ eurs was a journey through un@@ certain@@ ty and dou@@ b@@ ts , but at the end stand stability and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey itself . now he wants to help others in Afghanistan .

he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ad@@ awe@@ ya in Cairo , against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenges , victories , and upcoming trends in worldwide internet @-@ rights
the Egyptian Parliament will exam@@ ine a bill entitled that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority .
users would have to be able to use the social networks , within six months after successful law decision on the website of the authority as well as their issu@@ ing number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison or penalty .
the law , which was wor@@ shipped by six members of Parliament , is currently in the Parliament legisl@@ ative as well as the const@@ itutional committee of Parliament .
a further de@@ pu@@ ties for a bill would be introduced in the t@@ oug@@ her pen@@ al@@ ties for the ins@@ ult of the pre@@ sid@@ ents or high offici@@ als .
under Egyptian law , the di@@ vor@@ ce of the pre@@ sid@@ ents and govern@@ mental institutions would already be pun@@ ish@@ able . however , such a crime would be pun@@ ished with prison and money stra@@ ints , law from the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law shall be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for inheritance .
in addition , this would under@@ go a political climate , which is the right to free speech conversion and meeting places in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photograph@@ ers Mah@@ m@@ oud reb@@ elled Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 when he demonstr@@ ate Egyptian police officers to demonstr@@ ate violence against the military coup against the elected president of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited for more than 700 Protest@@ ers who had been arrested during the same inc@@ ident , four years in det@@ en@@ tion .
recently , his trial was shif@@ ted post@@ pon@@ ed to May 20 because the prison leadership of the human rights of human rights failed to bring the def@@ endants of the prison in the court &apos;s court .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death sentence because of one , so many human rights groups , head@@ ings of such as w@@ afer @-@ pos@@ es , illegal assembly , murder , and bad murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke two journalists HAN@@ Y Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ad@@ a@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the Stra@@ its of journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned inc@@ ident , aged 25 years to 5 years .

on the 21st of April , the document published by Na@@ wa@@ ate document thro@@ ws a light on it , like the pre@@ sidential plans for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , concerning Article 11 of the Tun@@ is@@ ian Press @-@ dex@@ es , which journalists killed the right to protection of their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
will China im@@ pose the users of social media to submit their identity ?
according to the new rules of the National Security Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the User &apos;s social media need to write or share news in social media .
in the rules , the registration will be required to register with full real name .
analy@@ st susp@@ ects that this can be achieved by the Eli@@ min@@ ation anonymous comments within social networks , and it is un@@ clear how offici@@ als apply to these regulations .
CHINESE networking have been proposed in social media , these rules are only sel@@ ective to saf@@ egu@@ ard civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship Russia shut up the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as the &quot; organ@@ izer of the information spread . &quot;
this term is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to whom the Russian government leads a list of online services that the &quot; publication of the government will also be responsible for removing contents and they charge them on request for the issue of user data .
to these websites are currently ranked websites such as v@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ pa@@ n@@ iki ( Russian social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .ru and do@@ zens of other services .

the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime and communication , has been im@@ pris@@ oned , because they work too &quot; a source of information that merged with groups to create a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time to block the website completely blocked , among others China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop , accum@@ ulating products
following this week , the government of Great Britain in the midst of a target@@ ed consultation with regard to increased monitoring records , Internet service providers would install communications in real time and backup programs to encryp@@ t the data encryption .
the government has cons@@ orted to t@@ elec@@ ommun@@ ications companies and intelli@@ gence services , however , has left other technology companies and the civ@@ ilian population .
in spite of those , consultation will continue until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
