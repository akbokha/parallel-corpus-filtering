<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">How many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have read and operated American authors.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American Film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered a murderous rebellion with the help of Julia Roberts, who covered the highest Federal Court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to method Man, "I was it, as if that is absolute truth, all others think it is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only intensified my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming you can always be the way you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very warm love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the tourism and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, how he is surrounded by working.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he considers how a former colleague expressed, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people responded to his statements and tuned him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won at the Republican Presidential elections was the highest number ever reached by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not have trump and his voters to harmony with people who I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journal, who receives people from all over the world, who have taught me about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">With Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer, also approached.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met us at our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I fought at Sandy Bahr, who fought for life for life, and her husband Dave, my host family, which treated me as her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappit, who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues to spoil us to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors that assisted me have helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who emperate themselves are deepened my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump leads his way to the nominal republican presidential nominees, they covenanted with me a stop and counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps not because of its contempt compared to non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that men voted for Trump, because they were either sharing out his racism and fanaticism, because they were ready to overlook these things, broke almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to record the trump-voters as a rattle.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people assign, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial, respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who deal in another way, and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and anxieties are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be, that these voters know, from which most white are, for Trump tuned, because they want to regain control over a country they disappoint?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who want the cruel decision to rise a man who looks like contempt on those who look different from it.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Gr.): as much as "rejection of the White against all other Ethnias"; Word Game from white into play on the White and Whiplash, as much does the great Van Jones called it, has just killed what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, there is still a powerful idea - what faith or background can you always have, America is called every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country selected as his president, twice the son of a Kenianers, whose history as he himself said, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with versatness, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rudder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all that I must think to Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said at the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration in Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word exchange with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone who do not have such a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan was closed with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was berered.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was pleased, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now bounded country, told the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could no longer be found in that new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this takes me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaian city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music, which is played in both places, has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill colony, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby precolonial ruins and world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">Since a few years now the La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the commune: one from children and adults made an existing Symphony Orchestra, which with their musical instruments has found a possibility to overcome them about poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school with 100 students can become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for their drug abuse and the gangs fire.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hopelessly.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members accept their duties due to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch, run through the dust streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the Truebel you meet day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani and conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay - on instruments, made from recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music instruments made of local solid waste materials made from local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycled pulleys of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate pods, violas, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion and all of the trash were made.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classic music, folk music, paraguayian and Latin American music and music of Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez reminds of a local Öcologe and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse in the same place, who had had no music at the same place, who had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not collaborate with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio, what he had never seen before: a violent produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra which plays on instruments made of recovered materials and will be called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A "" Landfill Harmonic "(harmonic waste dump) draws the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Each year, the world produces approximately one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live by him are the trouble - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something nice.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played music even before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted solutions for international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens during an agreement with Global Voices for common use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">It was known that this ship was already in West Africa that this ship had already run illegal fishing barrels before spreading the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries had therefore raised and inclined little, a law brever of this type to welcome their cows.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mosambique and the Seychelles are swiftly against the ship. they refuse to ask one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>

<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to start fishes there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the looting of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, crossed and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, was founded by the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery) in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar who had driven six countries that the Premier came out of their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" thus we have eight countries and work together and work together. you exchange information from and are mutually placed where it is illegal fishing. "" "says Tony Long, head of the PEW Charitable Trusts (Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is being caught is hidden, why it is hidden that it is extremely difficult to absorb, thus the illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberty use of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are supposed to harm the illegal fisheries of ecosystem, which have a deliconic poise equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">Yet while actions against illegal fishing had been hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also caused by the snowdrops, with the information between individual countries, the actions will be in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">The individual countries interchange each other, e.g. lists of existing licenses, news on suspects activities or details that could be noticed during a harbor inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea, satellite phone.</seg>
<seg id="114">It enables to mark the authorities to detect ships, in forbidden areas of fish, such as suspects that a ship loaded his caught fish to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a crime.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing catch can be refused on the basis of such ships in their ports. what means that ships cannot be sold their cargo as in the case of Premier.</seg>

<seg id="118">And that is what we want to reach, "" says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. latter is a adviser company which is responsible for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win $20 million USD in lost turnover, which lose the eight members of the HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African Waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">In East Africa, one of the most productive tuna fishing is essential for the region's commercial fishermen from all around the world. among those one even flares an illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Zu their practices including actions count as the sailing under false flag, fake royalty paper, indication of Phantasienamen, the fish protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>

<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legally sip hole attempted to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks that had caught fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that have several fraudulent identities and found it figured ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Co-operation with Interpol, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can judge information about illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our research projects quite far into the networks of organised crime", "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate surrender vessels.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system which will always be refined, thereby also helps to refuse illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to conceal their activities and their position. "" "" says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, which offers himself with fishing licence and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships put on for instance their automatic identifier systems, which will not be able to generate more of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects various information carriers. FISH-i can help you find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i can actually influence Africa's team of South Africa have no effect on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing companies?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, president of the NRO skyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth opened up with Google and the Marine Protection Organization oceana, the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform, the satellite system, and can be displayed in each navigable ship worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="141">We should do this on a global level. "" PEW Charitable Trusts has a similar project with which a global system will permit the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but it also happens.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were used earlier without licence and hardly any implicences we know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia also helped greet, the inspector found there on board Schleppets, whose use is forbidden.</seg>

<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of current president Nicolás Maduro the chance for a fundamental change; however, the maintenance of a new election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, deals in its latest articles the context of the government decree as follows:</seg>

<seg id="221">Pass just that they would not lead you one day and I need to save yourself.</seg>
<seg id="222">Abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary Volksarmee - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall. a few days later he took me on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father loved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university connections, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simple everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'da the prisoners are being tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me first four times after La Perla, all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in cars, furniture, TV, cooling units - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small wrapped in a blanket, and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump in silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted in an open room and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are being persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in and saw a couch, which were tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a bunkbed and metal colored.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later, I found that it was fastened to the end of a cable. the other end was fastened at the body of the person that was missing there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They rarely have a man with wrinkles on the bed, poured it with water, and pursued after him a charge of 220 volts into genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The tank there was in fact... as a dirty windle.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same scent came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the scent immediately and mine was clear that the smell of a body is in distress.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it only possible that a man can do so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me for the third time to work, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra, where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and fasteners.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also charged in the process) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a set of mattresses, on which naked men were stretched downwards - all were captivated on their hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance to the gates people still rely on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed I saw the prisoners, he said, "Why do you look so," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="254">I met "Why have you brought me out?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito," Romero pitched there a man and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">According to survivors, the Jorge Romero, who was also charged in the La Perla Ribera trial, was also charged to death in Raúl Mateo Molina (La Perla Ribera).</seg>
<seg id="261">The following video shows Emilio Fessia, the director of the Memorial La Perla, through the former folkles.</seg>
<seg id="262">The path that you came in here is also the way where the resulting came from here.</seg>
<seg id="263">If you're looking on the map, you see that they took around it and then have been tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were referred to as part of the process of dehumanization a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When she survived torture, the prisoners were cast into the cuadra until the arrangement came from above that they should be laid.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of people and disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War mute'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all possible things with home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "warriers" - how they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was in the military even when I was in the Gendarmerie - I was clear that warfare was a bayonet or maybe military badge, which one has been fighting a enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if one goes into a house, and the fridge, the turntable, clothing, paintings, money... demanded, that is not a warfare, but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I have always asked myself what my Father, the head of security forces, vandalism was carried out in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I simply don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal it all in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my Father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminals and I answered: and you who stacked cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not detective?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded before anger, struck me and cried out:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and put you hanging.</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need any other anybody!</seg>
<seg id="284">That was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no only good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of then on which I wore a jacket and a ribbon pullover from wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he gave clothes to home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been with this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me to burden what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there, in order to speak.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the corpse is the last abrogable act'</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I feel do remorse.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if you have only children, you recognize the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">It evolves and recognizes that it is false to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you have been exiled during the dictatorship. but why did the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why are children kidnapped?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl back home, whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">It was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: you were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why did their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not give families, whom one could give their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abdictive act which one can do a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they made machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were skipped and sold somewhere. no idea, where. "one will never find something," said my father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i've seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clear it: I have nothing to say to the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my Father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea of view my father, arose during a meeting, when he was put under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him sharp because of all the atrocities which I had to live because of time.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he said, "I don't know. I have not killed anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt quietly and asked me, what all the extriplateau patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings," which they allegedly defended they were good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried out:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed a terrible crime and you have to compelled me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">He only resisted "Now, just turn me."</seg>
<seg id="320">I exactly did that.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010, I will refund the first display.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally discovered that he was a crime.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can designate me that I am presumed. I have finally said to my own father.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong its leadership position in the last month witnesses of a very special translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word (rint sha), which means "older drivers" means that the "older drivers" means, and perhaps, but also with bad hints & # 8212, was translated as "awful drivers."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from September 1 to 20 in electronic ads in the input field and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was divided into social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The bug was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyiv. it was also known to the local news.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun initiated in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was initially removed. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "(German:" awful drivers ") was later replaced by appropriate, although grammatical is not completely correct" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ").</seg>
<seg id="357">The prefecture of the Kyoto's prefecture also impacted for the release mistake. in fact, she explained that the bug had already been given in the text, and that the translation was not checked for their correctness.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the sorry:</seg>

<seg id="360">The Japanese online messenger J-Cast News came out more detailed with the phenomenon of the "awful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "fearbar" was attached as an unreasonable description of older motorists. following the police, the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents are fully involved.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the prefecture of Kyoto, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 injuries were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1,803 from 11.850 accidents caused.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents decreased in total, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The naming non-called reporter in the article published by the article shows the light, which show the advantages of some Japanese apparently against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo over the translation errors was given the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" horrable car driver ") about reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">- "So is the translation really not, either, or?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that a real transmission error is."</seg>
<seg id="371">There is no few such comments.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation is multiplied.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and respond to active language skills to send it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter limit requires active screen language - something that is in the native language. in general, the belief that translator in the target language - not to be in the original language - mother language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French motherlanguage should translate from the English into French - not by the French translation into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as native language, the translations to the English. this may be missing for the translating, cost grounds, or the relatively low number of English motherlanguage that can be Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who do not have any foreign employees, have translations to produce firing internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best, no matter how good or bad its language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with fun results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and sumptuous phrases that originate from machinial translations, showing that this technique can not replace any human translators. this applies particularly to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the weird English formulations in Japan, among them also addicure print, often used T-shirts or pockets are used only for stylistical reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors can be acceptable or at least harmless or at least harmless. however, by major companies or from the government the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto takes a new source for their translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: how to use protests and censuring measures on the Internet and TV</seg>
<seg id="391">Enter the main page of the "Navegar con Libertad" (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7th, Venezuelan Internet users registered that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users registered that the Internet access from VPITV and El Capitolio TV are also no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcaster transmits recordings of protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionable groups to resist the Nicolás Maduro's government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court upheld the Parliament and the Parliament's duties to the executive branch and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of an Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was shortened to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access Internet access.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages venezial providers are reimprisoned again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offer such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezolans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant since 2014 on protests against protests. at that time, the Commission wanted to report with money transactions and closure, as the Commission continued on demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I have registered with @ vivoplaynet without cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that it is still cheaper than two litres of limonade to buy.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro, later, that not only Vivoplay through a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS) is unaccessable, but also two more online broadcaster. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous researches of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had yielded that the local Internet provider can utilize DNS. this is a technique to answer the DNS servers of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS server, the server does not respond or refuse the request when calling with such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elucoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">In VPITV, a third locked channel, the transfer was set on Thursday, 6th April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, which was carried out live in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores has been beaten, as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went back to the show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also regulates the Internet connection: thus the Venezolans directive will keep access to multi media coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series with the title "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("Flying Cows, waste schools"), edited and published by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household, where they did not live together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Just before her Graduation at the University she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was filled with pride regarding them. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">The place, of which has become something, "said she.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. when Criaditas is called in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a large family with little money survives her minderelage son or her mindery daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child will receive a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned, however, that the children may have to pay for countless days of home work, which can never be paid, and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that can't stand up in the context of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is very common in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She talked with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonials, researched and prangerte.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call these things in name, because the feeling of gratitude that is injected to Crimean is assured in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception" explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since then, the family, who have their daughter in the belief, make it so their vocational training, improve their position in society and "something from yourself" can give to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, which takes up the girl with the faith, and whose exploitation is justifipled by faith, who would give someone a chance that wouldn't be an apprenticeship or an hungered.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victim of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">If the girl is harassed, his family will only hear many years later.</seg>

<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the borderous in paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín in Caaguazú came into hospital, her body showed a bloc punches. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military family Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a resident of the residents.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived in her house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">End of January 2016, Ferreira, with a pole spread to Marín, until they suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of young girls.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They praised that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela, the deeply rooted in the paraguayian society in Criadazgo is responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They signed the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest petitions and demanded that there was no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, there is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it's very difficult to control, under which terms of girls and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couples and almost 60 civil society organisations need an efficient examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want, Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl, which was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market Candy to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they continued all to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita in the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">Thus they had to share the time so that you still remained so much for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up at five o'clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, purged the refrigerator, cut off the living room, polished the furniture and the ground in the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was end, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they had done with learning, the more leisure it had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had never had an hungred, but he had never got unlimited food. "I needed to pick me more books from the library of the house as food out of the fridge."</seg>

<seg id="500">Image by Pixabay, changes from Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published by the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary committees have recently agreed to "regulating social networks in relation to use and use of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="503">When he is adopted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt with governmental authority in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, one place would be set up, which is commissioned to obtain social media citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the acceptance of the law, users would have to register for users with their proper names and number numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it missed it, this could bring a sentence of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraids and is independent in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, which runs on the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video teaching and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is assumed if the draft shall not give it out, as the draft opinions on it, as the Egyptian authorities can not record that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentaries and supporters of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user name and a password by which the firewall came to block the Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to capture a firewall at national level around Facebook. because of them it would be necessary to adopt the Egyptians in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts in front of the site are sceptical concerning the technical feasibility of superiors.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technology is (in German "conducted research technologous") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt greatly on technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion she found it so that same as they can use violent physical public and private spaces they could be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, so it means that they may apply a powerful surveillance system to apply or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to result in a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">It is really realistic - but in Egypt all is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must be discussed at the legislative committee and the constitutional complaints before it comes to the plenary.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its assumption and submission will be successful or not, the design stands in accordance with a pro-military monument in parliament, whose sense shall maximize control and ensure that no deviations of the image is present, "says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the parliamentary majority of Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against Cyber-Crime, who was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who lead to "public order," and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining Raubtier in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and thrive of the ecosystem also depends on that a large premise is present.</seg>

<seg id="544">In the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo "daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo has been attempted to return over the past six years to revive the life of them who had risen from the" Trinity catastrophe, a tsunami and a atom accident in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. prefecture of Miyagi was a similar prefectures in Japan. both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbour contours Fukushima and Iwil were evacuated, because the tsunami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture also experienced a nuclear accident, even alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows a local view of which progress has been achieved for six years later to rebuild the local area.</seg>
<seg id="549">The comprehensive report of the newspaper articles includes both the statistics of Japanese regenerators as well as poll results of the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of planned substrate (in the field, and saigai kouei Juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwat.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success under the three prefectures were able to record Miyagi, here, 80 percent of the planned substrate was finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima construed the tail with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years after the catastrophe, one gets even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by accommodation (the well called the day, kasetsu juutaku) into definite replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw to be forced to lodge in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 we still lived with 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such cases.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 per cent of the Fukushima still lives in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was successful in 2011. more than 75 per cent of the evacuation, which were forced to submit more than 75 per cent of the evacuation, were moved to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For IX, the number is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and daily life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo's newspaper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by the misfortune, their doors have been opened up until December 2016, which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing companies in Iwate and Miyagi are now back into operation, in Fukushima, only 30 percent of fishing licence have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have been large in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwil and less than 50 percent of destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima, lie in the nuclear isolation zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has fallen back again, but the Fukushima still remains far back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwat are back 90 percent of the same stand as before the misfortune. Fukushima can represent only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, Kahoku Shimpo's newspaper reports that since the catastrophe, almost half of the coastal villagers, it has been more difficult to make their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total image, the newspaper led numerous survey among the native population and among the evacuation. they asked them about the stand of the rebuilding and even as you feeling on the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among locals native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey was that 83.1 percent of all local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those questioned that still not enough for catastrophic prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also has directed its attention to the position of evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima never had to live the tremendous earthquakes and devastating tsunami that was causing severe, catastrophenols, atomic accident caused, atomic accident suffered from Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 people from Fukushima were moved to almost 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people returned to Fukushima who have been resettled in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation centres are known to be more than 50 years old. they are known in proper settings, because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima, which are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="627">The popular municipality Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central and in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there are no nenned sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities carried out in the sugar cane.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the proceeding the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its facilities until just the scaffolding remained of steel and concrete remains.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some succeeded the work.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something that was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">NATO recalls exactly to have heard that in Mañalich, the sugar cane would be preserved, but that promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resistance already the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, to bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for worrying for the country some decades, but bad harvesting is no more.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway steig of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic need: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically dated, and hardly competitive, they were unportable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that were related to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased in front of a decade.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025 the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and nutritional organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will go with security in history," that were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, lactresses came from a total of 98 sugar cane factories, over 65 million people received their full extent to further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane company Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene is known as a soldier, he speaks about the closing of the factory, is the word that he repeats most, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they formed a full time working party.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first race year, the first letters came to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was the official documents related to these parts only regarding the parts that would be removed, addressee and the date are distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any compensation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Because of it the responsibility was overhauled and the letters were always more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the remaining sugar cane."</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the folk community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane sugar closed, or better said they started to unify it, they also listen to asphalt roads, which also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future, many young people left the region around once.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, which production is not even for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>

<seg id="692">Teenagers from the First Nations Communities in Canada deal with topics which are important for them. they are doing through Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan tour, for 2014 workshop, mobile studio studios will bring directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were guided by David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec to ten Cree Communities and then collaborated with Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop enhances that the young participants in conversations, such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-concept" or whatever can be found in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular that the team worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo, in the field of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tränen," a roadcut in Westcanada after almost two dozen were most indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were not solved largely.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game, how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs of customs is due to globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters have not ever mastered the languages of First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation is included, the refrain will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people concerned here received a little help from Gary Jolly by the Northstars Hip-Hop group who became a straw in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookpage by N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in terms of translation, as well as translation into English, translated here to German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if none of you are interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I am trying to go on Earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see nearly every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are located near the entrance shokuhsanpau (the well, "plastic models of dishes") are served by every food that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look forward to these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo District Kappabashi, there is a large number of these small companies which produce those plastic dishes, which was documented by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">Most of the Japanese are these plastic dishes, so they are not even more striking. however, a new trend transforms them into obtrusive mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii series issued by social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic layers decorated cellphones bands, as they are shown in Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some shopping and fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essence is increasing increasingly.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular travel dish with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part we have made for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is a apple, which contains your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like a apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing approach into the coming.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile designer allow you to make your own artwork. in this case ikura is used or salmon roe, a popular waopping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubt:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there somebody saying would say: "Wow, cool, now I can declare my mobile phone with salmon roe?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic layers can also accept a few appetite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, also itballs (onigiri), earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other decimsical plastic loungers can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 2. the logis included.</seg>

<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime makes us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by threadowers and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometres to get something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "like fear life") explains exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who is looking for every weekend secret tombs after his son.</seg>

<seg id="771">You shall insist the insurance of my Father, but it does not pay them, because they charge a sterile certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we come from it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" Explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't have to show the faces of those who are in fear. we must show the international community, the conflicts and the state guide.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a writer from Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution is reminiscent of us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been with disease and sensation journalism now I know for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass the cover pages every day and see the cover pages with images that actually only come from a textbook on criminology or from files.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only thing as if I am the only one who resists or sad. it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be valid or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year-old cousin remember that he is Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people listen to the offences of the offences, if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it is, as if they have lost ones who have lost somebody and those who have fear that it happens too.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to bloc numbers are in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The crime of mankind is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighboring place that they were "upright."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk, that they spared not of such tragedies when they don't stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months" expressing in the Capital of Capital: like a family with threats were plundered, until they had depressed the business of their business until they had not only destroyed the business, but also their family had torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you lost and about how many people can change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away the trauma, the fear will come up again, if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are apart from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested others, because they don't know if they are kidnapped or kill.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these fearful days if I would like to resolve my deepened feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to cry. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence called" generation. "</seg>
<seg id="800">In the background he throws his questions about how he cares about the child of a miserable woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexikos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like the boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he told how to make himself a egg, potatoes, tender, tortillas warm, and "chichi." this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine fools on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unsignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unprecedented for a boy for the whole life made of violence and to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, man told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a moving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation looked like in the town of Juárez:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of morality according to the government of government and government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor 3103 Morde. this corresponds to average 8.5 Mords per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few of thousands of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of new lines. this project is reminiscent of those who we are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 created the data rejournalism project Narcodata into life, whose goal consists of complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured out the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to raise a rumor or counterfeit fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how did it come up for the first time? content in social media, whether true or true, tend to stand further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident over seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used to overthrow tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - do not deny the fact that there is abundant rapporrations about events in the DR Kongo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">It raises questions about our longing to pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck crossed the place Sange in the East of the DR Congo, nippets around and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa, Africa has been neglected, and thus ravelled. the streets in the area have become dangerous holes full of percussion and were difficult to drive.</seg>

<seg id="828">Administration fees are described a fire ball, the dozens of houses included, including a cinemas, which was full of people who illustrate the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and minuted bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the ignorance.</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example for this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows shortened body that are rown on the ground while they sew them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photograph performed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but certainly not to be attributed to the tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the Boko Haram fighters in Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyelets reported drastically from Gräuble did, before which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and corbasses were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massacre.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained to count for bodies," said one inhabitants on Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, shot and burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite pictures, the subsequent time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nigeria and the trial of Boko Haram had been winning the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture shows the image from the DR Congo as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre in 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false publicity; Africa check has been documenting to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was taken as a cover for masses.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments like this example, the picture from the DR Kongo on the sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flask, published by the United Nations, who could escape, rape, rape and some tote, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against the Rohingya, posts as the following on which these descriptions are taken with photos from the DR Kongo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acienda-Arab news page, which said in 2012, the President Myanmars Thein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Kongo to revise this information.</seg>

<seg id="858">Other messaging organizations, the AFP, as their source, had likewise attributed to theim His statement, but had not taken the picture of the DR Congo in connection.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide reach of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these wrong couplings could reach back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come back all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reversed image search," can you see how far data can exceed boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reversed picture-search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures at 18,8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the trendy picture from the DR Kongo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mix of private sites, platforms of social media and common publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article by 2014 about students who had been killed by Boko Haram, published by the Boko Haram, has expressly explained that the image is not written by the killing, but it claims that it was a "similar dist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the Boko Haram massacre erated in connection with the massacre of the Boko Haram in 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to settle that it had connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" (Nigeria is burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Kongo raised with this Twitterhashtag, taking a discussion under Muslims of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve their Communities this events, which took place in the name of Islams, a larger attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was sweating as a cover for the Boko Haram massacre (and more than 9.300 times), but the messages that were associated with them were taken up in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to establish attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the assault on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (French), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was written by a "Pater Juan Carlos Pascal" about the Nigerian Massacre, were translated into circulation, as described here on Vietnamese and explained things on the wrong side.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the image was included in the DR Kongo, the organisation of the Claretiner Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the picture from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two powerful topics or frames (skins) that make these posts through. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in regards to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assessments of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of the Rohingyas through Buddhism.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is evaluated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers can't donate this images longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are threescore people, accidental to carry the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugarcely this mood dismisses the misery and false messages that real atrocities are untrue, and that what actually happened in the DR Kongo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures has been debated in detail (e.g., for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the retention of images of a weaving occurs to recognize the tragedy. they are even asked by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that certain pictures readers and audience fresiise them and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study, which investigated how violent media affect them to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While exercising with violent representations in the news media, fact is fact that they are invaluable in today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will be careful about the situation, in which a picture can be somewhat suggests, in which a picture can be obtained from the context or completely misused species.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false supplements should also consider how internationally they can.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons used in accordance with CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranlatable (eg. uncovered) tries to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in each language: you can express situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these inseparable words are already well known (such as the famous Portuguese suction) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish soaked esa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist, persistent every experiment a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, so a complete explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand what is meant by a word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words were already collected in an online list for a whole time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on smaller languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Taxotlap of Vanuatu, as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Remaining your parents in recognition of how to settle yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth one feels when you have washed in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They kidnize other cultures, reveal other thought-length and wake our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes influence how we analyse and classify the world around us and classify the linguists on this site still want to publish more of this "untranslable" words, as different, valuable and impressive these small languages.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages" that are very appreciated by Untranslatable are invited to upload their favorite songs here.</seg>

<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still inaccessible regions.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following images and videos provide an impression of the extent of the catastrophic floods:</seg>
<seg id="977">Floods in Tawalama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the impact of the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="979">Even Sri Lanka's deadly flooded the Denguefieder crisis, Save the Children, after further rain falls already on the way.</seg>

<seg id="988">The pickaccess app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app, thus the catastophenzentrum is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year, the PickMe triggered a "High Aid relief" -key, which allowed it users allowed to call a vehicle for pick-up assistance and donations. these were then sent to the srilankan Red Cross.</seg>
<seg id="990">Similarly, they led a "SOS" button, which had over thousands of requests and 150 successful boat interaction between floods and landslides in a consequence.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts of the government and of the civilian population of Sri Lankas, where multiple social media platforms are fully exhausted, bringing people to safety and afford relief measures.</seg>

<seg id="1001">My friend looks at me and says, "These things do not concern yourself, or?" why, because I am not Muslims? "I wonder.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I already have this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I have working or people who know me since years - the Sahar, which they know - from the broadened concept of "Muslims," which has built in their concept.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They kidnize me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't see all equal.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice different religion.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, in different kind. but somehow we will be put in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims who do not miss there.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be missed</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This even happened to the poet, whose poetry is being sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was so old as I was now, he was an orthodoxer Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>

<seg id="1018">But religion Rumis was allocated in western performance, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>

<seg id="1024">We continue to continue our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful, erroneous narrative, our newsfeeds dominate.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative is overshaded reality that have led to their countries in the last three decades, while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative, fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented to bear their headscarf in public buildings, and Saudi women, by their government, are compelled to cover their entire body, both sides of the same medaille.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group exercises its "control" to the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong Narrative weakens Muslim women who lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It looks like that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to the American soil of Afrikaners who had been brought with slave.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has been deeply rooted and flawed and flawed that often Sik-men and children become antificiently antifical attacks and chancies.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we don't tell it, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Belong to the 1.7 billion</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than tell stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create Narrative who help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed to handle the narrative of 1,7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we are failed to account for seven million Muslims who are in the highest level "religious group in America.</seg>

<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about an initiative of Steven Bird, the intranslable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language-diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or in Oakland in the United States where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk of which small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the native children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities that have not forgotten the diversity, in which inhabitants must not forget, who they are to be associated.</seg>
<seg id="1143">During "often they are related to understand" understand these events instead "to make listening to feel, to make." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller tells their story first in their own language and translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion lead to their display, making the listener on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions than the language not longer than a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows example a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this stage, the storyteller Rsidatou conate also the opportunity to explain the storytelling of the narrations of storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak of the rabbits and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having asked the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked, "how is that to speak to a audience that does not understand your language?" with a broad smile he shares his feeling of clusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were quite with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling occurred in three cities, and organisers hope to expand this. all that are inspired by the project you can organise with TLS in order to organise their own storyteller.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the USA new festivity of the debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new investigation of the public school of Puerto Rico, which has joined 72 million US dollars, involved in a mass demonstration, the Marsch started in the city building of the capital city, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Civil Front for the Neurons of the School) and the Ökomenical Assembly of Puerto Ros.</seg>
<seg id="1157">In addition, the advocate of the debts have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their call:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ros calls for the politicians, banks and government agencies, responsible for debts, responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for financial testing and an Steering Committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed, our working conditions equivalent remuneration, which are in favor of economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We become expresently and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ros refused to pay a debt that is not her.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with sinctive Rentenpayments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the state-of-the territory of the US - suffer from a heavy financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," an governing independent non-profit organisation with focus on social economic development, a law for citizenship, as an alternative to existing state supervision.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ros requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">In case of explanations and conviction of the citizens risk, the measures will go to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration wore the name "night watch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian Web developer, Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missed since a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives made the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year: publica, hosted by the annual conference on digital culture, dedicated to Berlin, dedicated to the event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing books from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Costs of Freedom: a collective expiry).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that was published in the last year and is licensed here, contains a range of articles that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to work as movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artist, designers, designers, researchers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of freies knowledge have been involved in order to spend the mists and make a sense of our newsfeeds and create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison, which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have never had any information about his current state or stay.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory portion of his book with the title Collective memories gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his liberation and let him go back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how bassel will pay a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we opted for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of open source and digital activist has been appointed by Syrian government authorities in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, bassel from the Adra prison, a non-military institution was transferred to an unknown village.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel informed on the basis of a" strict "état command from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">On 12 November 2015, Ghazi had been contacted by persons who presented himself as an inside of the Assad government and initiated them with an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Its whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in that access to the Internet and how to expand public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and presently over the director of New Palmyra, a project supported by the Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Based cultural prototypes was looking as the work that he began using a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to construct the ancient ruins of Palmyras virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the way of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would judge all that architecture, which not only embodies the cultural heritage of SysWOens, but in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip of digital archaeology and preservation has created a period of professions that will be for public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Typically Bassel could not yet close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my overall life, dreaming of freedom and bases me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even as he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read English well to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my goal to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also brought other prisoners, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without leaving them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a candidate, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She pressed the texts to him, when she visited him, and translated them from Arabic into the English.</seg>

<seg id="1228">It happens at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I miss in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">I lose the spinning in the moment in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the danger is not matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, bonds and transgressors</seg>
<seg id="1233">I miss the prison of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I penetrate every detail of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes might say something</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To bring all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to cry out and to smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I'm hooking myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against the regime Bashar al-Assads, there are more than 65.000 people disappeared according to the VNetwork for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime, were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many more people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">Since 2012, the Global Voices community calls for the release of Bassel.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand today in hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: following corruption convicted the director after disclaiming in previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambikers responded with anger on a corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in order to establish the corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">On this occasion, Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other co-defendants with four other accused (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money originated from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was built between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was freed in 2016 because of good leadership and asked for his act to the company, what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Assembly of the Republic, which exploited the application, there was no obstrudence for Cambaza, again to his old postings, as the company had no disciplinary procedures after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people had not respond to the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution that is responsible for public transparency, sentenced to a decision by the German wave to issue the decision:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and represents lack of transparency and even a setback in regard to the efforts of our legal system, CIP enables the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">As we consider that the company should have a disciplinary process against the traffing would have.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent and causes no reasonable steps to apply the respective functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior and considered the case. "</seg>
<seg id="1266">When Cambaza is a competent guy, it would be advisor to condemn the sentence and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is competent, he has acknowledged to become reintegrated into the company, which he helped.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it's obvious: Cambaza is happy to be for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosaic and student of political science in Brazil, says the director is no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza rewards by the state because he couldn't believe him that people are rewarded with such a way that the State had already been massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lack the morals and serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but not only by themselves the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a handele understandable an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is tired of the preloaded and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte is preferred to remember the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief in prison is:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diebe belong to the prison Samora Machel is not only to be remembered as the first independent president in memory, but also as sharp, cutting and - side by, prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, as he energetic, "a more honorable person to be able to sell his ambitions for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said: "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but it does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were leaning also:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he sat down 10 years and was released.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today he put him the company, at which he turns out of money, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - сти: + AssimVaiOMeuPais - стати: (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12th, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook block the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and licensed many users to impose</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or age-age.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social network took their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people's ostIndian origin, or generally used as adjective "Indian".</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or the logy (in burmesial font) as part of an initiative to spread the widespread problem of an enemy in Burma to the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascension of radical national movements gave the word a extremely absent Konnotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as an hillusion against Muslims who depict a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the way, speech in Myanmar is fighting, the company licensed a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'nowadays really likes to be associated with racism, but the word itself doesn't call an automatic speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even postings in which they have discussed the use of the word, or doubts of the use of his use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are several burmesial words with 6 different meanings, which have the same scriptures as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words as' Kalar pae '(' age '),' Kalar Oat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">Facebookutzer Aung Kaen explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way, if they would like his back pain, he couldn't play a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase la - "healing" (ku) + the questionnaire (la) on Burmesisch - resembles the racist, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">ZIN Win is the opinion that it will decrease speech to radical nationalists, but emphasized that Facebook has become an analytic, before it wither all postings caused by suspected racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It's filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automatism will not understand what you write on facets.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should be done instead, the post is carefully analyze and control it by verify the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age-age).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, speech, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to trimming their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action does not send a strong signal to all, speech, like the efficiency of this strategy is not long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China as Sina femino and WeChat have proven to use the censorship of strokes often a cat and mouse game, whereby the user can use social networking, a new word or an alternative spelling of the licensed word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaen Myat described as Facebook started to erase his postings when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... as I was informed about this new guideline by Facebook I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I left the liken, post and parts of Content for 24 hours, because the post of the Facebook community does not correspond to the Facebook community. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts that have no negative insights, or simply try to show their views against hillfully radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy is that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with an enemy:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without an interview was removed by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the mail the author shared his mind about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more before the initiation of the initiative, for example, the Burmese community is asking:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook is a benevolent purpose, racism in Burma hit by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words will focus only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems to have been forbidden to have this without local context or technical support, as "chair" or "Erbsencurry" chair.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they did not have made mistakes, they sought not to rectify any postponed posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If only some more respect for the 15 million benefits would have a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided for a lot of spine among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking serious, users now feel funny and reconsciously to see the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see whether their posts will be taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook postings, who contained no hunt speech, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Using permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch refreshments and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just trying to try whether Facebook contains the mail that the word Kalar contains. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, with approval used.</seg>
<seg id="1334">Next post, If you are a doctor, do you cure people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with approval used.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their votes and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">In addition, speech is to heat up in social networks, in addition to the municipalities in Myanmar in addition, specifically in Rakhine area where disputes between Muslims and Buddhism have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was to his failure to criticise hillings on his burmesial pages below control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of just the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to see current, more in context than on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The nursery is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the State unanimously decided to offer a law to offer this practice so that the age-effective age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">In fact, in May 2016, brother Harryperad Maharaj, the leaders of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), one group, was gathered to a group of representatives of various religious groups of the country, that the state did not apply to the state, because it was not the maturity of the maturity.</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN children's legal intervention, the minors, as defined as many as 18 years. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">The UN statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 there were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's Statistical Office confirmed that by 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to the age of 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which were dismissed, laws for the nursery, followed on the feet and encouraging great support. without doubt it helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nonetheless, not everything was smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-guide for e.g. had no concerns to say the critics of the child before, they should be worried to worry about their own business. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This type of religious opposition was uncomplicated for tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and eventually got any doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill to vote against the nursery - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the Opposition and an independent profound - so that he could be discussed in a representative office, where a simple majority of it would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must vote and shew the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators announced a status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram was again posted:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of children's presence in the Representative House with 35 votes and not only decided on it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having been resolved at the Senate, the design can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws have been changed to the nursery.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook is a member of the Ministry of Education, Lovell Francis, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has fallen in too much time and unnecessary dishes, but you know what? the nursery is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illegally, and this is worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson's opinion, it was definitely long enough to play the practice was Lara Quentrall-Thomas was so happy that the day was finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which said: News, outstanding news!</seg>

<seg id="1376">Prior to months Maharaj passed his intention to take a judicial steps to take the law, and he seems to be his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the General Attorney of Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, said it is quite lawfully if Maharaj would like to push the law against the law, the most social media users would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell shortly before:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we try to speak instead of the debate, in a way that only panic and immedness may say that it might be of great, hard-plotted men that are related to them, would you be ready to discontinue the discussion?</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English language Wikipedia page was, on January 18, 2012, opposed to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For a month now, Turkey has been interested and popular on the Crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV series are against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technological presenced Internet users are usual, use tools for blocked web sites (a recent article from the New York Times telling that Turkey has not the third largest dial prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been registered under Wikipedia, since 2008, as recently in a published report on the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been held, the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">Turkey is the second most popular country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several Mirrorpages (pages, reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as platform all Turkish Wikipedia sites, which is based on decentered peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine-machine-machine connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is nevertheless callable despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (on the plywood from Wikipedia), we have replaced it all over them to read snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so, it is possible to read the content on decent and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also associated with that this step was independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only available to screenshots and any Live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrorsides, when in the country Wikipedia, is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consultonni reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and associates at the Mozigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy address, one mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One gets to another URL, which is not the original is. that which one sees, is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server redirects the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even when they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around himself, never satisfied. they were blurred with poorly positioned patterns and well-washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That's motivated him to bear a camera and try to beg the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">He was a child back then.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar attempted to bring himself on the international stage of Nepas Tierwelt.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot images taking attention to Nepig wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, as this prime location helps with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the outskirts of Chitwan National Parks, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home, when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist village Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">I immediately ranged with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father was observed and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was, and I immediately began to crack pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to acquire collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepig nature and would like to prospate the understanding of that wild animals are not so fearsening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know, because he stood by the presence of his face toward the face of:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be disturb by the opinion of sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was due to the dark in the way home, when suddenly the king of the bush was appeared. he immediately calls us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is the "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for Environmental Protection).</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and Wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived in a tent in order to take a tiger for up to 12 days. up to 12 days, it took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds, which live in the vicinity of tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally published on video volumes, an award-winning international media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care to speak their husband's name or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use one Pronomous or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chisoisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband's social pressure as well as fear of consequences, they should abused the norm on life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted from the indian State Odisha, by a headcourt and dismissed by her family and the village community after having taken a married relatives with the name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition also does not give their wives by name, it is also common among men. however, they have far fewer concessions to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women played, among them healthcare personnel, a unique club and thus quickly became a key topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they discuss the enemies of Patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs found there in 13 indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and is responsible for the degradation of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children marry until the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected persons, and heads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how this clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time for the ambassador of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion round, honed by women who did not call her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She opted for this topic, because she wanted to open a talk about the Patriarchate with a problem where women can easily identify the women.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not according to their husband, a custom of her husband is not entitled to maintain the taxable and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini cries:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition has proclaimed that a woman wishes her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not include this is considered deceively, as Mrs. without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thoughts to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to do with her husband so far as he had called himself, at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband are weigh more long after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me, saying, I call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self confidence in Baggage, Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchy" never before. some believed that it was a good cause, because it meant the younger members of a family, especially girls and women are protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to bring the debate with an exercise in aisle.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant, the name of her husband with various feelings of saying - happy, antifunged, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husband, but they can call us as they do, that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day when they had called her husband on her husband," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a century-old tradition, in whom she married wives of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only flawless during the whole practice; and another decided to unfold the whole inflication against him and his family by giving him cursed.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression of their faces was ecstatically.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenaline, with an ancient bridge, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini to and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife couldn't stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother hid her, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less intelligently and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, as shown in the forehead of the zinnoberRed point on the forehead, which shows the spousal status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the cinogas red point, if he also hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but mine, they are now in a better position, even to bear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion of discussion is a safe place to exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with every discussion of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make women who hear what could hear, "says she.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, she celebrated her own birthdays with cake; they dance and talked about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet I have worked for some things, such as our identity as our Ehlers, never so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things according to say, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and associated with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried Sari for their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some wanted a sage-curta, a wide shirt above a pants, they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the ancestors of his own hanger, the morals connected with the Saris and much more, smugged Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Obershirts) in a discussion round so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure that they can create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, if in the five months did something have changed since their first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming to the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but they ceased to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some are included, but only if they are alone and no other family members are present.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of her husband; only one or two women contribute to any time ZinnoberRed on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion of discussion know that the changes that they would like to reach them in their lives - like feasilibrium or their own hanger - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By declaring each other self confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw ini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is giving us confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be one chain reaction, if every woman talks in the club and other people talk about what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to take the salmon line to China, as the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message has spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee gave his hope to unconditional release and invited Liu to get his prize in Oslo.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent nation as an independent nation.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark was triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the meeting of the international Branch Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister of Lawyer's Association defines the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because it Compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... No one has asked whether New York be a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and thoughts to create this precious country, we hear that we were not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had to escape an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended a idea, according to what one could not measure the political system from Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of his, he appeared inconsistent.</seg>
<seg id="1699">By contrast, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally as cities that become permanent by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the main focus of the subject, the good old lyre of the rulers of Machaze blew up, leaving the prejured logic, because they fit better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In final effect, the answers were given by Shanmugam during the last week of Shanmugam answers to our press, our Judicative, our political system really not answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding issues cloaked with non-answers rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel is attacking Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I think it's a bit difficult to go.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore do not have a country, but a city, which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our new K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point if he was high paid to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on his comment on the blog, he says to read about the critics that you should start to read the whole manuscript of Shanmugam "in the context of the testimony of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the caption.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was more a "city" as a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so uneasy, even if we are enjoying ourselves free and just choices.</seg>
<seg id="1712">It was in Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities we saw a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">As he said, Singapore was not a country, "he obviously not meant to be in this mind!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment via Shanmugam, who makes a leader of a heralgrowing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore is saying that...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I didn't know with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde - which I did not agree with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he's true, right and conscious of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugam Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "committed a mistake, or was it a miscreator?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we are considered an independent and superior state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of town come back to Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the governance inetts, the testimony of Mr. Shanmugam is of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why afford carrurer of their military service, but they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay off our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">If the Journey Journey of a Decade commends to the affirmation of Singapore and was always a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have many buffers more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear something like "the defense of the country, especially" etc., but that's not quite correct.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1737">The Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked about recently his editors: what is the most abused aspect of your home or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Your answers are published here as a part of a continuous series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world, and another facets should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series originates from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most provided to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry, then I am." I come from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation takes place, it is considered polite, interest in its meeting partner by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">At my clarification the standard response is usually followed by the standard response: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadian warnings may cook for Americans, but if they are kept for Americans, but do not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For anyone who is not familiar, there is little to distinguish the Canadian waradiers of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadian flag grow well visible on their backpack when travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Everybody loves canadiers.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American, however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began travelling 20 years ago to travel through the world - in front of Donald Trump, before going to Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadian has always carried small maple leaves to their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons for us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender-sex Ehen has been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also considered to be the tolerant Land of ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not such as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadian are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Firstly, I have many American friends who I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would make me nothing if you would be confused to listen to Johnny from Dallas by mail.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, "kind" means "is to be called" kind "says in essence - as the brillies, gentle, but tragic figure Ned Flanders," The Simpsons "(who has an own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "kind" does not make personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing but toast each other.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting to make no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that happen around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even be able to say that the desire to be free and alone, a main igenetic of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own business.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What an errorstanding as "kind" may just be just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadian, no often talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm hearty, open friendliness, which I now connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau got the stage to show that Canadian waradiers are more than just "nice". our prime minister has made Canada straight.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop-band parodic Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop-band has released a music video that was parodized by the junta and reproduce the power in 2014 and continued to restore the civil government.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band tattoo Colour discusses a young man who tells him who makes his girlfriend with him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the musical video still refers to the persistent military domination of Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video loaded on Facebook was divided into 1,254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin-Video "The Dictator" has been blocked in Thailand after a group of activists reached the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as it is concerned with the country's position under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these images of the video that relate to some of the political issues that have worked hard in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may relate to the wiper section 44 of the preliminary constitution which grants the commander of the Supreme Court of decision about important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">11. rule: "change your setting" refers to the notorious program "by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons who are considered critics by the Junta as critics.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computercriminality, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by authorities to negotiate activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit in the army has also been organized and communicating on the online content and persons, in which monarchy is rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand lies a strict law against "Lese Majeste" (majestic land).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that said Junta is still traced to purchase their decision in U boats, though security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax traders.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people can be thrown into a black delivery van before they bring them into an internment camp.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison, because they allegedly rowed "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened by long sentences, they should insulge the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the songs of the band, which imitated the salut from "The Tribute of Panem" was already used by putsch opponents during protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1805">It has now been over 20 years since the Georgian-abasian war officially ended, but its scars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the Northern district in Tkuarchal show distinctive images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the carbon-pool of Able-Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Skarians, Georgian and Armenians lived and worked together for Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, mostly Russians and bats are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost town in Able-Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people, today there are only a few hundred people in these clerks.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the Province of 16.000 people had barely increased after a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Along the way of migrants that crossing Europe or Latin America, certain locations will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I attended one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is situated on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a little woman with a corals-purple diamond frame and gold colored rings in teddy bears shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapestula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) became a target for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 Dollar / night sleep in single rooms, crushed threads, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is one parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel yet, hundreds of African and Hawaiian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs Ramírez tells, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast to call it: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it's more quiet but in this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept even outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buys medicines you can not pay them, they are massaged them with a balm that crested from long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurt camp) is posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came to Brazil from Angola and hoping to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"Yes, yeah," he answered with a smile. "I really feel that it suits that African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hopes to arrive to Boston where you can find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have already been living in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans on the way to the United States, to make a first stop in South America and then moved towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other attendant family from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans are often traveling together and that Africans can speak on WhatsApp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companion, Michelet lived previously in Brazil and worked as a building worker for building the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest in Mama Africa. he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mum and we never let them go again" says he smiling. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her that her guests are often broadcast texture once they are gone to greet you or to report about the course of their trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chickens as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps known here, but it is not the only sparrow hope for migrants that travel through Tapestula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and has found that the bus ticket to be sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and cooking outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests make.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they do.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After three years he lived in the United States, after he had lived for three years.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants that travels through Tapestula, comes from Central America, other people open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to blackmail the money, without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In tapachula he asked for a vacation rental and a unknown, a single-known one has offered him the roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and they tried to decide where the next steps will go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the streets you can consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she loves her album with numerous pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair caresses that you made a clientine, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she briefly imagines her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya'fueron," they are repeated every time. "they are already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants will be forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Check-in for personal communication devices in Xinland of Twitter users (SUMSAA).</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, ethnic minority in China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi gives a mobile phone notification in which they install the district government named Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the communication, it is said that the app will go to access terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">But, however, the authorities can also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh Women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app after they had installed the App with a private WeChat Group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app would determine the sources and distribution of terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective utility with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojans and phishing pages to make users sweating how much time they are online and to remote control your home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions may naturally be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" government actors or even hacker capable to manipulate the home network of a person, or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While militations about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, the reality is very often dazzar for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit imrest and dissatisfaction in conflict regions, the authorities often arrange extreme censorters and surveillance measures as well as regular Internet circuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">On Twitter-based Media-Outlet "Images from Mainland China" (the day) published in China published, showed pictures from a Checkpoint, on the policemen of the crowd apart if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The agencies in Xinjian represent sure the people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected on a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they can be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced to use people who are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captive through English transmission technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (the well) Account Manager, published in addition, is a jingwang product description, which allows the software to fix a Windows operating system and thus achieves unrestricted access to your computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang will become electronic papers.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may possibly cause a reaction to the instructions of the city-party, to minimize the prevalence of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and with the party connected facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a US American human rights organisation, also mentioned this new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi an ordinance with the instruction to all the inhabitants and entrepreneurs, to 1 August, their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable disks, notebooks, and media memory cards."</seg>

<seg id="1998">One that has settled down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow Metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But when the reality picks up again and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actress, the beautiful scenes and the performer - transform the characters into beings from meat and blood, and everything went after death.</seg>

<seg id="2004">It was filed, that the city broke down the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar".</seg>
<seg id="2005">All city quarter rose up, only my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, without having false time, even if I had no high demands to a city, which is up to the arteries of government meetings and their compliments.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night, things were something calms after the power supply had stopped in the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke out the silence, by taking several times "Allahu Akbar" by my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resists through the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to find together.</seg>

<seg id="2097">With his music, often involving themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poison, however, demands not only to the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues can not only be found in its home town of Amman Relevance, but also in cities, from Damascus in Yemen to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as a man who is not limited in his thinking, and he can suffer from his own failure to suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it does not distribute it openly, he proposes a special inclination to US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib observes his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib won't believe that his sympathy for those who try to do anything with his identity as "Palestinian pointing of the second generation, even if he was born in Jordan, so far has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own lives," emphasizes Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then adds: "I think so as I am a man," while living in water soluble Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in that time it is planned for Muslims from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordan law say that the public intake of food is illegal during Ramadan illegally.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for it, to break with ancient traditions. another cup of coffee has a little of coffee at a sufficient hot Junitag a little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally speaking the gap lukewarm coffee and the floads of the Kent cigars in the nose in first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky above all, especially if you throw a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is so easy to avoid to do basic things - how to drink in public during Ramadan water, to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said to have a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some debate, which support the Islamic Action front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argumented that the sexual orientation of homosexual fronts have contradict the cultural and traditional standards of the country, and the main reason for the concert is.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MPs and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition of Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the ICTR.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many pretend to claim that the band's involvement in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free opinion in the Arab world, the ancient approved legitimacy authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila rated the jordan people as the progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to use" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not just simple rhetoric, but actually a clear anti-crystallying reality reflected in Jordan was clearly reflected in Hdaibs plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib set traditional gender norms to abide by which he formed his vision of the fate of Arabian women that had voiced sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously unknown woman whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who have lost their lives through the hands of them, they should have confidence.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of Honour de Honor - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch Group said that the number of Honour de Honour in 2016 reached its zenith; however, Jordan was missing the institutional infrastructure to support the victims of moral or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the spread-fighting from 1954, women who are forced to be detained at any time in prison, "and for their release is often a longeological bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family needed that the woman will be nothing happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to look back on the subject of topics that are long as tabu gold in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib was politically melted that his work is politically melted, but it is full of explicit concerns on sexuality, freedom and expression, not of politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He was logged in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" will focus again on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically politically engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse was repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and anyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a art market where one can get in his words, "what you want" - be faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of piles and readers and that comments on the equality of LGBT Q + individuals were still censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib was an interview for the popular jordan online programme Roya to realize that his comments was torn in the context, rotates and been censored by his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only one worked version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires open to the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerances were not spreading against homosexuals.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nude, a poet who remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asked: if Abu Nude could work that later on behalf of the calendar should work openly about homosexuality, why can Jordan not know that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert has been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordan news service commenced several former government delegates and members of the teacher, with the reasoning, they would have expressed himself on comments in social media that merged with the deep in the land.</seg>
<seg id="2142">According to its opinion, the concert Hdaibs is according to the very tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to consider a structural rethink in the next generation of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress has been a permanent gent and take-away Jordan to the second time in a row, but the way of progress - is made from slow, remind and innervation changes. it is sure that these changes from day to day is taking place in the heart of the jordanic society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally Hdaib was dreaming, like millions other Arabs also, from a Arab world without interventions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">It is not only dreaming, his work will bring up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to do them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is called by music, art and literature of a real and fundamental freopenness - and not by bombs, streetitions and on artificial art. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as far, Hdaib is forging and thus resists resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting using the Aman as Student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of death, that the landed and the dancing came across more than one thousand years, in the armies of Japan, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to snip a few great seats, so we have a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (verbtl.).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have long been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two festivans are straight on.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori to itself, the Nebuta Festival is the only truthful - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18 meter high car was amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were external appearance and body care so important as in this history, because they help him to keep the peruvian youth from the crime and a legitimate profession such as the Friseurs.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, located near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drugs are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">One in April 2017, the survey showed that 51.5 percent of the population does not feel confident.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other medium- and South American countries - increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and therefore also the unusual hairdos of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), with Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the experienced hands of hairdressers that demonstrate this up hair style.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go on the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts stand along with each other to show who can create the eccentric locos as you can see in the following video (see further videos for current competitions this on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions just like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who were in El Callao, found there a chance to convince the weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work in the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated from this activity and the advancing possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can gain a profession, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year before the school year, the school offered special training workshops and reported about some of their achievements:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to Guerillakämpfer</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the version of the contribution "lovers to Guerillakämpfer," which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This paper will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who know we?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more importantly, people who feel gated to receive affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the 'BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation. (letters to reconciliation), the young people encourages the letters to write Guerillakämpner's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was a place of historical events, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with Guerilliabetic FARC (german: revolutionary Armed Forces of the Columbiens), which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the name of the peace agreement as the result of peace that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, there is a long way in front of columbianism, until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakämpfer, who were lived for many years in illegal camps, and around the clock had trusted their weapons with their arms, to integrate himself into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society once again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeper against guerillakämpafers, it must now support them in their ranks and constructing it a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young columbians would have to join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And they just did so: until now they have written thousands of young people letters - love stories to former Guerillakämpfer to welcome them back in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former Guerrivämpfer - who will be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the world summit of Peace Prize, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who we love to write thousands of love letters, but those forgotten they need much.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan his way he talked about to share his love with people who needed the most urgent pruch.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was created, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who will now have to build their place in society and to do a new life, to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace, say it.</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolumbiens such as Cali, Manizal, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would be forgiven.'</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19, which was transferred to the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the foundation of Bogotart traveled to the camp to bring letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC stood up as they used to oppose to the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters of submission of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from fear to luck, and everything that is between." he told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, this unforgettable experience is:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having committed the letters, a former soldier led me through the Guerilla fighter camp.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the Guerriakämpfer live) saw, I saw a Guerriakämpfer, who wrote a bit.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed lay a MGL-granular designer, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I said to him, "Hello, what do they just doing?" he said, "I am answering a letter which someone was written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written me something so nice, so let me ask. "and suddenly the tears went over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him on him, and set me beside the garnet designer.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry, and was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions to his fighter and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. himself was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I never thought that anyone would have forgiven me to my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society without an open arms waiting for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I learned only how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">Students came to join students and some leaders of the FARC at a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as war ruled and the FARC already ruled in the bordered.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC wave the history of organisation, their ideals and sight into their views over the peace process. now, where we have the possibility to develop us to create a political party, we can contribute to the company in that country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For an objective of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "one of them said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people, who had never heard animals, and no electoral law had ever seen and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings, who were shot by their habitat and the environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Reality, in which the country lives, is wounded to me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - also who have killed, and so much damage have to give us something, and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the Commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letters:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbianern was made to rule, that would rule peace after the disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons; and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now put on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they hear, talking about all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford to our contribution, and bring offerings, because we know from their own experience that nothing is easy. they are among us who defend life as the basis of existence, are many difficulties before.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media rated the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grosny that talked with us some of her experience and talked about what is happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Many months the LGBT in Chechnya in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines, after reports were published that the towing, torture and potence squeeze men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta; she cast a light on the methods of the Cheetitian authorities, suspected of suspects and they placed in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transformers, was born in Grozy and raised up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She has felt a woman in reality thanks to her childhood.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was grown, her aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so that she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had experienced their landlady, the hunt was founded back to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She was afraid of fear for her life in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working on a volunteer company in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day, someone was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transformers who put in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her to hesitate.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her to help him, he thought he would be a friend of my documents and spread all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. so he sent no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate these shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made me by the whole WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing that I had a few shopping bags of my car's back, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around myself, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on a bark: "how long will you still honor the family, you make a shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke the last Endes in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything along and started to cry.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was flown.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two headings in my right pulmonary.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: what hospital have you been placed - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is my male name, but the doctor, and lay me down to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his sidecar, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got drones.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They cried to me, back to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They requested to return to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They earned absurd demands: some said, I must record it without going through the streets, and others knew that I had not changed my sex at Grozy that I had not changed my sex, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I've witnessed baskets size C - what should I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once again spoke my mother at the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster into the world, not only your family, but the whole republic is ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot stir up because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became much too much, and she laid down a Strick to his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors went and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to switch to the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a darkened window discs and a number plate with a 95 drauf.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it was clear that since something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights unchecked friends checked the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you flown?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I will not give her name, but I will say that I am reminded of all remember; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then happened something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot realize how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without registration, without passport, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and she cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you did not believe in safety, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which Hotel du Fst. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the sexually observations, this is a torn theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional cascade elements carry me still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So I can't want to overcome this barrier barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I am always saying that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I truly give me trouble as the person reminds of her past - thus in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed in?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to somebody who did eat a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan could not have been arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So that I mean, they may charge the relationship with the affected person and at the end request a proof of that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood genugtubing.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now also gay men involved in these secret things?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there's no much for me.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relatives or those of their relatives have been left to put on Kadyrows trial.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be recorded there later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show up their bodies by television, they would have attacked your village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Are you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not vanished, but specifically submerged to radiate himself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I tremble just someone who was imprisoned in Argun in a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after being grown by Bart.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was himself counted when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not introduced as a band, there have yet no reports. we assume that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these followers and demonstrations of people who heard a so-called "nontraditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I still wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already familiar to Grozny when I lived there - and I had never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Serious! in the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was gold, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia wanted to lead us to "civilization" in the end of us, but finally back into the stone age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is it possible with the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were tamed; I had dyed eyelashes, carried all tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety department of the Sharia never stopped me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where there were several bänke, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never harmed up.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a reuse: Kharda ma Kharda. that is called "Spotte not on the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to learn children when the sick of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have her eyes closed before you because they believed, they were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never jagt and never crushed.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long held this pig time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long to Kadyrov to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking on TV about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us, but priority over the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">But still - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had to be laughed and laughed at once with argon.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily slowed down.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you planning to work now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as waiter.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I earned no much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">I've always been working as a activist as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teetreffs, gathering, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have to pay a cent.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I laminated a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: carry out an Hidsgo?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">That is how nature, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens can verify you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which have the Kabardines who have the Russians are also known; but on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - Do Muslims who go into the mosque and fasting in Ramadan, live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transidentity to men who love them and believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience. but this is a tear.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of sensation to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I am so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of sumorality within the hidden Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestor region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arabian population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months, there has been a strong increase of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with approval.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi, on August 27, the situation of the Arab Ahwazi-community in Iran was characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the ancestral region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered by anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to come up inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights are working in ancestors and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube kept the moments after he had tendered himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegu hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide who has occurred within the Arab Ahwazi minority in August, and activists ahead of the site that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ancazi Centre for Human Rights informed that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have been appended.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories are together, together: we were all family-väter that were helpless and unable because of the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment, and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where most of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to dispute their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the pile avi monarchy took over power and took great efforts in 1925 to stop ethical autonomy all over Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahajz region there are some of the largest in Iran to present oil and gas fields as well as some of the most effective and valuable useful areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is developing only slowly, and the native population does only get a little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victim of untreated diseases, hunger and discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is denied by Ahwazi Arabians in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a multitude of dams, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are caused.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to destroy the destruction caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youngsters now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director of Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare, Proclaimed that 5% of Ahwazis, who completed the primary school ended, 55% have completed a secondary school and 45% university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aim to destroy the mind of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment, and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" of suicide under the young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi had said that especially the unemployment has become worse than it is a combination of a high number of ancestors in Ahajz, and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Because officials and institutions does not prefers Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is preferred by access to working possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of ruling regimes, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force her living out of their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and surname to get their affiliation at Ahwazi, since even Arabic name will not be tolerated by the workplace, because the speaking of Arabic language or the carrying arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi should have to adopt human rights activists, before the situation explosively.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be waiting for whether the world is awakening and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with Feminism, also with the internal fraction."</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement made by Ayomide Zuri, and originally published on the section Afroféminas. this article was subject of several discussions, where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be found in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who deal themselves as an interactive feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not a part of movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even think well thought out scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be Feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money despite the same formation.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observance, when it comes to you what they are doing with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women sooner or later in various fields of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender still moves across the many different countries and religious directions.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is conscious and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I have to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black women in the LGBTIQ community, or on black women from the Diaspora; if I have already been abused, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white internal feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless they all agree together that women - all women - come together to sing "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing" to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to say that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutional form of racist, which we are exposed to black women.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women other ethnias and heresy sorrow earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migrant background of the school are proven to be white girls because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women suffer from a higher risk to suffer from a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership to suffer as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">At that time, I want to have all women, all men and all the same rights. in other hand, I can not join me as a black woman, in whose centre is the white woman who refused to consider injustice in their thinking, which relate to both the sex and to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I will not fight my membership in a white-feminist-oriented spheres, which always repented me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech: "I am not a wife?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalising essence.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to complete me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs to push their egoeccentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to draw more importance the importance of hypercolour and sex. for some of them still continue to avoid the importance of black women to feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the Interaction Feminism was founded to spend women of more bargains a home and reboating from the white Feminism, "still the word" feminism "in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I draw it before me to disconnect me and all of feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as woman in life, instead of me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent as a new phenomenon is celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and give us to the spheres which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the Book of Africa: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves, in which it may be completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, physical, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and interactive feminists are immediately call, after they have read these lines, please inform about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a blurred environment, I can feel black women and women other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized by my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this Paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flower in a environment that is neither over, nor ignored, yet ignore.</seg>

<seg id="2467">This post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about international efforts to resolve environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2468">In the context of a content-sharing agreement, this article will be published here again.</seg>
<seg id="2469">Always back to Nabil Musa in the past 7 years - usually with surfboard or in the canoe - with a special request by the region of Kurdistan in Iraq. its mission is aimed to deliberate the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we will follow Musa, who explained his relationship to the rivers of the region and the influence of pollution in his commune.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river, which we lost when I was still a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dust-absorbing, pollution and uncontrolled development, lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the Waterkeeper Alliance - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which is responsible for it to protect the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq as well as to support the local communities in sustainable use of this natural resource. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was produced by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multi-media journalist, edited and published in Erbil, Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The main emphasis of its work lies on the subject, severely subcultures and is characterised by using kooperative videography and new multimedia techniques that can tell their stories to their way.</seg>
<seg id="2477">Paraguay, women and their difficult fight against violence</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kursky. the article belongs to the series # Porsermujer (Sloicheinefraubin), which reports about the level of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protecting people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer said Ada Báez, said it's nothing to Luis Balbuena, her partner who could have been active towards us.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship was over time and the police said, her testimony would not be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman, Balbuena was showing because of abuse, beneficial also the real display of Ada Báez.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman retreated their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women are busy at all, they did not get support of the state in general.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, the women dependent on men are dependent on the men, who do not abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who are admit, victims of violence should be reported in the prosecutational authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Persistent impacts and statistics for statistical abuse and legal system that nothing underneimmunity of Paraguay: good approach, violent implementation punches and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to identify how many women are really harassed, says Myrian González, Researcher for Across the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socialist research institution in Paraguay. "there are various details and reports that are not even presumably based violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the numbers available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Prosecution filed 9600 ads because of domestic violence. at 70% of them it went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertising the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in peace studies. 86% of women of women came from here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics are however not showing the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayian women Minister Ana Baiardi will actually appear only a few of these criminal offences. "every woman being refunded to Paraguay because of psychological abuse, are 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For every woman, being refunded because of physical abuse, two women do not do this, "she explained at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is no way of an offence, the persecution authorities can not be registered as many women each year of their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Between August and August 2016 journalists were at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has been documented with at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died because of violence.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a rule system that does not undertake</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he noted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she did not wanted to regret her, but she was forever regret.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos. but for two years she brought the psychic violence amongst them - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would have a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I thought that only women happens to be subjected because they let themselves down by violent males.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described their insults and various attacks during their two years of relationship, and told how he had isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to be a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long from Carlos and left him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, was fighting for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner was harassed.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I believe you") which consists of women who are all in any way sacrifice of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk with others about their experience, listening to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the sayings of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias returned by the authorities without result and also of their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against its former partner who developed into a permeable jurist struggle between Paraguay and her home country where it mainly went around money, power and influence of its former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, defective implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The advert of abuse is a path of resistances and a fight against corruption in justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Füry) on 10 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# nonsingle) are part of a campaign on Twitter operated by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law is planning to explain the Femizid to an independent offences and harder to pense like it already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the lawful text was modified in some point to win the deputies for the law so that the way for discrimination of abortions may be bothered, which are currently forbidden in Paraguay and may be punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was foreseen, the most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs which have to bear the victims of violence, even if they just want to keep an ad's place, to retain the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislator does not provide adequate funds to provide:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, missionary is seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A remembrance must take place here, that violence is no longer considered to be a bit normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of that facts, making the offenders gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to do so long advert, until rate of abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguayan Senate. before that, the Law of the law had been modified, which was called a passage of a passage in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper still exposed attacks</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website was closed due to a resolution of the information Minister," says Azamn's homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Korean authorities reported the independent Arab journal Azamn because of its coverage of corruption in the sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison, where he has served a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors from Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and put on court, but came later again.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had his father, Said ibn Taimur, through a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the principal officer in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, chief of the War, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council, and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rulers of the Sultans is characterized by most harbous efforts, notified of domestic freedoms, including press freedom, restriction and human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, to be imminate and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and activist citizens, including corruption on the public affairs of the country like Corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, her closing time and detention three of her editors last year is a hard blow for the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its inception in 2007 (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016, following the title "High-ranking parties bind hands of the judiment and the interference of high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Al-Abri, a member of the Audit Committee, was transferred to the Special Department at his arrival and at his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS drew the Deputy Editor, Yousef Al-Haj, who had been acting as Chief Editor in Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed down in an uncertain period after the Information Office had announced that "the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way, including online, will be banned from 9th August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first session of the trial against al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the court in Mascat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned among others for disorder of public order, "abuse of the Internet," and "revival of the State of State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of violation of a public sphere and the lease.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of arrest and monetary charges in the amount of 3,000 omaniacial Rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was condemned to a year of prison and fine fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars), having found the use of an information network for spreading material that might be a danger for public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a damages deposit of 5000 ombian riial (13 000 US dollars) was set to be released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court pronounced Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 and sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after the prison sentence of his six-month prison sentence from the Central prison sentence. al-Haj is still in prison where he faded his old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also put the resolution of the Ministry of Information, the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court, Azamn's decision, the newspaper sees itself out in terms of attacks by the omanical government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information adopted a statement with which the closing of "Azamn" was renewed for three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the minister took up another time against the decision of the Appeals Chamber to reproclaim the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The andrudence of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been injured in Oman in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to show up.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the forced closure of Azamn and detention of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the Korean authorities are still not ready to prepare a comprehensive injury to the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Center for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the Chinese authorities:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj temporarily releasing and unconditional release;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. a safe environment for the newspaper azamn can be created so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the Press freedom in the land and</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely cheap or even mentioned in the media, which addresses the growing needs of the continent addressed to one of the most urgent needs.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the demands on-site medical research there are two reasons: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread more serious impact than elsewhere, and lack investment for exploring this diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big issue.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is conducted by African scientists, is able to establish its own research content in Africa. major role of science and technology can only be conveyed to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Zentrum for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic revealed first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself worked on HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to supporting the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discuss the future of medical research in Zambia and misunderstandings about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the use of research results. I also support the sambial national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just starved a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion the most important research themes in your country and general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise we will always keep the recipient instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we get, are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it's impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: the US and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded by differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine work which you did not before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have continuous power with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it lasts months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need of special academic education, starting in each age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploring the space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientists in Africa based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are a limited speed, things to do, and to obtain access to scientific expertise that shows challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals are only available for payment (the so-called "Paywall"), limited to the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: like "Open Source" seed producers, world-wide food production will change</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred already in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 species, such as outsourcing, the first plant, which have been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Morton's work was only 20 years long, Morton's work was given only by its own income and the question as many salatsas he can get across boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the early 2000s he noticed that more salads was patented and that he could not continue to retreat them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents have not only valid for individual types, but also for certain characteristics, such as resistance to diseases, a special rot- or blissed leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years more such patents have been applied to more plants including grain or boxes of money. due to this trends, plant care, environmental protector and experts make food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still has lettuce, he needs longer than ever since his work is still going to be more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would be a rock in a river, in order to paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when it withstand before judgment, no one can breed a new Salatsorte, because all features are patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tries to listen to those features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement, which is always taller in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS have bred red tube salad of the variety outsourcing in the "greenery" of the station. there it is being tested if plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather so sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-Source" -seed) can be inspired by the motion for free "open source" software, which provides alternative to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as spiritual property, and can be used permanently for planting plants.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, for short OSSI, U.S. breeders may be obligated to be able to freely use it from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, it does not mean that they can't do business with their seed. "open source" breeders allow others to cross it in order to breed their own seed, and not instant it - two aspects which are prohibited by many plant patents or pre-written.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of grower and seed companies have already been joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed-good and the possibility to grow new plants as well as for environmental protection as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Saatwell plays him a role in bigger gathering such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control on food levels and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little to run by means of seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture or not. "who is offered good, locally and sustainable producing vegetables, should also know that the way is bred to itself as such as this vegetables are cultivated, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Diet sovereignty without seed bensovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide others, their seed is still free to make it in contrast, seed and plant features to be patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi subsizers argue that the future of food supply has been endangered because the available genpool is on plant material due to the always countdown intellectual property rights to plant material that is thus limited to restricts.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of OSSI, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation of carrots and their availability. it found that around one-third of all carrot features is protected as a lectual property, which means it can either be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are still no estimates such as Luby suggests that massaging plants as wheat in even bigger style are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of sightings</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they prove their undesirable features - from such, their taste or her color improves their own taste to such, because of which they prosper in certain environments such as Pest or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders through more patents increases. genetic variability now is more necessary than ever since the changing conditions are predictable by climate change much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto is important that genetic variability is important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four official banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Agriculture of the United States, the company register for preservation of genetic variability.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, she contradict that spiritual property has to promote other breeders, since "patents and protection of plant varietaker innovations." "a patent is taken into essence, once you can follow, once the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these statements help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not inhibit innovations, but promotes the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks like the different: 20 years to wait until a patent is certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you are waiting for a long wait, to grow on plants, which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, we have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is however that genetic resources were always been an all-meant and remains said: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetus incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate farmers to work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what makes us shawless and it will not be impossible for us if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">A total of all, Morton is disturbed to the concept of making plant features: "we do not create the features of themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them itself and as breeders, we ultimately do no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeds in the US state of Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who covers a variety and bred his own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in the industrial farming with large patios and monocultures, are cultivated by herbicide in its cultivars of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just genealogy. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, do not reject them the patented starting or they hold it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The high-quality Frank Morton's plant looks for Salads in his breed.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeding is more innovative through the avoids of plant patents: "it looks like that I can produce up with my efforts, stronger than company, the patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need new stuff for my catalogue, since I know that my opponents are sold out my sorts in a few years itself," says he. "with a patent is worth 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it very nice easy for me." worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be leading the U.S. in the "Open Source" breeding, but the concept is spreading itself rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources, the center of farmers relocates the center with farmers and helping them to grow new varieties that meet specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports you to get "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agree is working on an open-source "license which ultimately represents a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI-obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for the breedings differ from country to country, not simply one can pay one in Europe or other parts of the world in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the Executive Board of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that the conventional cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it says against the current practice of the European Patent Office, patents on conventional cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet a law; now it is to governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, based on the farmers, non-governmental organisation and seed companies from all over East-Africa, to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and global trend towards the storage of seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for hivos' program for "Open Source" promotions, that the organisation currently commence a global alliance for "open source" seeds, scheduled to drop the official start date next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger between environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international Nonprofit development organization USC Canada and Concentration Group) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity around the world, to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map to publish.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, which is a global alliance for the future of food - a group of relief organisations such as CHP Kellogg Foundation, which means that farmers will have to carry out seed, and to improve seed, to ensure that a stable supply can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection between the Luby of OSSI hopes that soon more people will be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has been given above all that and how something is grown, and saateses have hardly played a role, so luby." we are now trying to conquer the people more behind their food. "</seg>

<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still trying to unlock the contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekends of the 05.August the Egyptian government shut the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents the human rights violations in Egypt, as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook in which it canned the Egyptian authorities for this step closer and promised the work and efforts of human rights in the area.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information bleibt- despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution of the Egyptian right to defend it. even if it has never been so difficult to overcome this targets, so it was not so important that all technical possibilities arise, to overcome the blocking and displaying our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 web pages, like bspw. the independent news site MADA Masr, Arabian language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jazeera for alleged "Support of Terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2735">The blogs, blogs, is very old, but has been given in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is yet for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in contracting the sense of a siege of siege; an attempted murder, a sual murder, summing up the national security Council, blocking blogs, and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not know in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a little audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used to post a post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way up to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities shut down technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), among others orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the locking of suppliers, through the change of intercensorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday 12 June, we felt like the rejection of web sites, which had to offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filtering the contents on the Egyptian user might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will additionally be deteriorated, that the censuring key is taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using them from court against those actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The residents spread.</seg>

<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis, the financial situation in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO organization Global Justice called even the United Nations to adopt the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these are daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to tell more about crimes that happen in every big city around the world as murder, preb, sexual crime, etc. everything that happened from the civilised standard. (...) This is our way to call "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to cry: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, that we could not close our eyes before the cruelty as journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor's editor that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war rubrik in a country which does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas, there are members of criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial writing the newspaper writes the newspapers:</seg>
<seg id="2768">For us, deliberately is that a war course, if he is distorted to be used, skillnesses of the police which first becomes wrong, and then asks questions to destroy.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and struggle against corruption in the police, whose purpose is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" submitting more than them?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira is argued to prove the violence as a "war." this was their opinion a justification of security policy for the media and might be worshipped to accompany responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as extra in the analysis of the military staff in Rio itself - in combination with unbelievable investment in staff, refiguration and historical and selftive negligence of the public service.</seg>

<seg id="2782">Initially, this resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. since several years upward, the upp had to protect against Schikanas and pressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the needy police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010, where he explains why violence in Rio not declared - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the Rio as war also attracts severe consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Because this calls for the state to assert the state, the means that a civilization is typical for a war. with which a civilization is a cruciful point in the landscape and for the object for "collision damage" and "trimmed balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her that fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer from Rio.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011, and in the subsequent civil war suffer many Syrian cities, among loyal forces and loyals, mainly by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Institute PAX and the institutes of The Syria Institute, are in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib at present about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is especially strongly affected where an attack on 21 August 2013 caused an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organization that the massacre of the Assad regime was administered.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013 these areas have been disturbed by rebel controlled areas outside Damascus, which led to that inhabitants died, or by tunnel and control points of forged foods.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By the longlasting blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become inaccessible for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can implant their own fungi as a "viable food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alseda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi are not part of the standard, planted in Syria and are only extremely rarely part of Syrian cuisine. her food price does not make them an attractive food source for many local residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">To the order of the French News Agency, Nabil, the subscription to the French News Agency, said:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for the cultivation of fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been struggling for three years, making this project known and pressed his relief out that it now wins more and more "in popularity."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alseda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to sell 125 families of knowledge about planting fungi, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about 12.700 million, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo between 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the fuel bench, locally made fuel used are used in order to provide the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started with the "production from the regions of the fungal seeds, before they checked up their quality, and they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they plant a small mushroom in a tub. when this was accomplished, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they designed a "teaching farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the start of the project and after 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila declared that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"we want to teach the human fungus for various reasons": fraction of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2825">Provision of a new source of food on the market.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Spread a culture of self-catering, using food residue (such as paper, tea, coffee set, cardboard, etc) can be used for extracting new foodstuff.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Creation of new jobs, particularly for women who work home.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Creation of new jobs for people with disabilities, which are tied to their home.</seg>
<seg id="2829">He said, "We hope to spread this idea in all over the world, so that our success as well as our fight against the hunger and siege is visible.</seg>
<seg id="2830">We want to inspire our experience people in crisis areas and we can help humanity. "</seg>

<seg id="2873">During a night in autumn 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings, which had defeated the short-lasting pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time, Ashark Barati, a 13-year-old boy, belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghan for the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother said it not at that time, she knew that she wouldn't see her son much longer - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick it up and bring him to the toppers.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara, who had been murdered by Taliban, and many Hazara were immediately felt.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban's famous for their hatred came closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after the run, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">A few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy, and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he assumed that was left of his low salary, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragons with mortars, who were heavy as he himself to earn his life.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees came from Elend and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," I remembered herself in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site, which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we suspended nylon in front of the open windows, that we did not refreshed at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">At the dangerous crossing on the sea suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum claims, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Ashark was homeless, run alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who separated twice a day food.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers as a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is true also that the conditions that asylum seekers are to be found in the country, catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Rights Organization "Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" suffer from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in more than 3000 "special admission centers" in the hands of improvised and unqualified staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers could only be assigned for asylum, if they have officially registered an application for asylum, which is able to pass after the registration of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, have either been attracted to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it came to Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbelievable live will help Ashark soon to free from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of construction work in the construction industry, Ashark won his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while, he opened a second hostel and a bubble.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis Success Story is now part of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venice) - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transition solution in other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghan operated company produced, among them tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian media for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of its restaurant Orient Experience in which the Kellner and the kitchen staff mostly refugees from various parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant runs through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the history of its journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs aims to go far beyond the Italian food industry and retail trade, and aim back to the land that he was forced to leave for teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, possibilities" says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my land and I can't feel happy when I know that my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the country's poorest provinces, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Ashark also plans to learn plans for opening a factory in Kabul, which can sell packing and preservation techniques. "thus, they can sell their harvest in the market and improve their financial situation," says he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development to successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts, but at the end stand stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark has made this journey itself. now he wants to help others in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen report: bills of Egypt offer disconnection social networking networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in detention.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot, the challenges, victories, and upcoming trends in worldwide internet-rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian Parliament will examine a bill entitled that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use the social networks, within six months after successful law decision on the website of the authority as well as their issuing number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison or penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was worshipped by six members of Parliament, is currently in the Parliament legislative as well as the constitutional committee of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="2936">A further deputies for a bill would be introduced in the tougher penalties for the insult of the presidents or high officials.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the divorce of the presidents and governmental institutions would already be punishable. however, such a crime would be punished with prison and money straints, law from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law shall be adopted, this can mean up to three years in prison for inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would undergo a political climate, which is the right to free speech conversion and meeting places in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographers Mahmoud rebelled ZID (known as Shawkan) on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrate Egyptian police officers to demonstrate violence against the military coup against the elected president of the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited for more than 700 Protesters who had been arrested during the same incident, four years in detention.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was shifted postponed to May 20 because the prison leadership of the human rights of human rights failed to bring the defendants of the prison in the court's court.</seg>
