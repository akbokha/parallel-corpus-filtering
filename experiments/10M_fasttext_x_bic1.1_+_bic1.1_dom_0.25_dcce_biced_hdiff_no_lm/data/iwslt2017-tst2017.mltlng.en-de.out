that is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New @-@ York Times re@@ porter .
long before som@@ eb@@ ody heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen has written a book in which he pron@@ oun@@ ced striking tele@@ phones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US @-@ secret operation in which the CIA in Iran was literally sur@@ rendered to a nuclear bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , you read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know , whom does the chapter not like ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has established against R@@ isen and call him to name his alleg@@ ed sources .
in this train he became a symbol for the patterns of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower to condem@@ n the journalists and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Complaints , the media have the right to publish secret information .
however , it is impossible to address this right when media cannot get this information , when they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ ds .
so when the government was fu@@ elled when R@@ isen was , he did something that many mu@@ ak@@ y re@@ porter had before him ; he refused , saying that he would prefer to go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen has lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the process , something exceptional .
suddenly , although they have been essential for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in time electronic monitoring , the re@@ porter and the sources can still be less .
instead of f@@ light@@ ning and pen@@ ises to speak , this also might do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ator , without his consent , had taken care of his phone .
exactly like his email data , financial and bank information , its origin , and even it@@ iner@@ aries with the list of his flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and cr@@ acking .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised him to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the justice was convic@@ ted more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that one can be a problem , especially because the government is too much har@@ lot of their work as being secret .
since the 11th of September almost every article about national security was the result of that a w@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalists .
so , we put the press work out of the game , which shall be protected by the first const@@ itu@@ ent because the government has more possibilities to express all .
but just as the technology of the government allows to handle rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
indeed , you may contact it from the moment in which they are contact , rather than in hind@@ sight .
today there are communication software , which was not yet written as R@@ isen , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower that was originally developed by the internet presence , which was developed by us by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working on by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of e @-@ mail , enter a news web site , like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send documents , such as with every contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the respective News Agency .
so the government cannot get more sensitive information , and many of the information they would require it would not be available from it in .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments over the world always develop new sp@@ y technologies that all end@@ anger ourselves .
it is sure to ensure that not only the technology employed as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to as@@ sign a mis@@ fort@@ une . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower .
the effect of abuse during the supply of soldiers sc@@ iss@@ ed white and of crow@@ ded hosp@@ itals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for the infected water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis .
anyway , these technologies have not only been made for those who wish to cover crime , but to protect our all const@@ itutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data collection of history have been published . &#93; &#91; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Palmer of Global Wit@@ ness for a statement . &#93; this week we were able to run by messages over a rec@@ t@@ angle of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s resident law firm mos@@ um Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents have a small in@@ sight into the secret world of tax h@@ av@@ ens .
we will get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sy Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , exchange messages , such as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
there are reports that a ally , the ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has sp@@ elled pe@@ aches in tax h@@ av@@ ens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin goes on a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others give ner@@ vous to the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
this sounds like the plot of a service of agencies or John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ novel .
it seems also c@@ ries from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we approach that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and weak@@ ness are able to hide it in tax h@@ av@@ ens , and not all taxes you pay for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phen@@ om@@ enal .
in the world , we discuss the media and leading polit@@ icians , such as secret tax h@@ av@@ ens of some few , you may hide and ve@@ il be something that we have been discuss@@ ing and reve@@ al it for ten years .
I think so many people will make this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how this tax h@@ av@@ ens work .
I imagine it as a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ capit@@ u@@ ppe .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company what it will nearly impossible to understand who &apos;s behind those pra@@ yers .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ut@@ ors and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society , what is thing .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans who had previously reported in these re@@ vel@@ ations , this sc@@ and@@ al .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans , who hide their wealth in tax h@@ av@@ ens .
but through the principle , after which these tax h@@ av@@ ens work , Mos@@ sy Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
we would have had a data collection of the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US @-@ States you need less information to give a company to start a company as to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed to pick up people from debt distri@@ cts , to pick up school children .
it has allowed to convert any an@@ no@@ vol@@ ous investors .
it is this kind of behavior , which concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a covered warming into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our agent in African ministers agreed to bring a house to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked all that all up to one lawyer in our investig@@ ator suggest@@ ions how he could transfer his money .
this was all pre@@ val@@ ent . no one of these lawyers accepted us as a client , and of course no one was committed to any@@ body . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this as a single acc@@ idents .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who has been spre@@ ading to our conce@@ aled survey@@ s .
it &apos;s not about a single top pol@@ itic , involved in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it works as the system works , through corru@@ ption , tax c@@ ursed , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the game rules .
we must change the rules to create this type of behavior .
this may sound very much more mean@@ ing@@ ful as if we could do nothing but if nothing has changed ; as if there is always the rich and weak@@ ness .
but as being born optim@@ ist , I truly see that something has started to change .
in the last few years , we have seen lectures to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the theme was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has captured the central regist@@ ers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the U.S. is behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama re@@ vel@@ ations , this huge in@@ sight into the world of tax h@@ av@@ ens , is used to ensure a global increase in the US and global transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ aches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading polit@@ icians who appreciate the problem and end it by law through the laws of in@@ transparency .
along with us , we can finally stop this type of tax c@@ ursed , corru@@ ption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is history as I am almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the boot room of a red Maz@@ that would be land@@ ed .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a deposit for sale .
a type in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was only in the city alone and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to peace sc@@ or@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the invoice , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just learned it ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is going to do it . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot time of a Maz@@ das .
this is a small boot time !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head saying , &quot; Have , such as please ? &quot;
at night I was in bed , I kept star@@ ing at the ceiling , and said , &quot; Oh man ! what have I filed for me ?
a wild alien in my living room .
what if he is going crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , in the tenth pe@@ aks to the door , and my sleep door lock .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work of art , which he bought from me , hang@@ s in his class@@ room . he is a teacher now .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view@@ point .
perhaps the people who were sold in my childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends who wa@@ ited only for waiting to be discovered ?
people used on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am un@@ employed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ate attrac@@ ts and the rent will be increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in town . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can create it , anx@@ i@@ ety walking into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have out@@ lined something that we could stay to a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can sleep with us , Wi @-@ fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham @-@ cream t@@ us@@ etts , we tast@@ ed completely different because we did for our guests .
we t@@ oured with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell , star@@ red Brian and I joined us .
did we just discover that we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
the things came into ro@@ les .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a concept of business .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we would like to create a site on the people publicly presented their bedrooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors can come by .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the miss@@ ile would fail .
but indeed , they do not .
no one , who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a shop , the stran@@ gers are allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , you mind the things that you can do . we could be des@@ ir@@ able .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immen@@ se trust between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence ?
I would like to give you a KO@@ ST@@ PRO@@ BE , what kind of trust we aim .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it is out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
insert your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this quiet foot@@ ed of pan@@ ic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when she first opened the door .
because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to stop the un@@ locked phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most feel the respon@@ si@@ bilities .
so feel most of the guests if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who really has Al Go@@ res cell phone now ?
could you be announced on Twitter , that he can fight for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you of some dis@@ cover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor should have imag@@ ined with his name ; if he would have told wh@@ ence he is coming , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you would have 150 evidence that they all say : &quot; he can hold very well @-@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you have to cancel your phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strength@@ ens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to ad@@ mit neg@@ atives .
ultim@@ ately we decided to wait until the host as well as guests had provided their dep@@ artments , before we set them online .
we discovered something new last week .
we conducted an study with Stan@@ ford . we examined , how probably it is that people trust in one another , depending on how they are in terms of age and homes .
little less surprising we trust the people most , who are the most similar .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
this is a natural social system .
in our case , it will be exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case .
if one has less than three dep@@ artments , nothing changes .
but you have more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation bo@@ asts common common@@ alities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply root@@ ed pre@@ ferences .
besides , we ro@@ de that confidence is dependent on how much one is priced .
here you see the responses to the first message of a host .
if one tells too little how &quot; Hi ! &quot; you &apos;re no answer .
too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; Tol@@ le &quot; art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing holiday with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design that produce a degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write anything .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help you overcome our advantages over fore@@ ign@@ ers .
by what we had not expected , the great number of people that were more than ready to place these pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ces .
here you see how many people will take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ reless work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that had previously been previously un@@ covered .
for us , the shop runs very well .
of course there is also times when not everything goes smooth@@ ly .
there were guests who celebrated the un@@ authorized parties or apartments .
hosts have put guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front line , if trust has been broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it &apos;s wo@@ e when I just think .
the dis@@ appointment , who he@@ ars in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motiv@@ ation to improve us further .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , the 123 million over@@ sized nights had only a fr@@ action ever a problem .
they tru@@ sted in each other .
when trust works , it can arise in Wonder@@ land .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travel@@ ers who tend to go to heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hosp@@ itals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are genuine protective gel that saves a life , even though they do not know it at all .
you ride a hospital in your own hospital , if you die , and waiting for a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to be lon@@ ely , they get books .
they leave a even longer stay without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this way , of course , not every stay .
but these relations behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought of part with money transactions together ?
it is about an economical trade .
but it &apos;s just simply called &quot; rental industry &quot; but the thing is not just being justified .
Share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relation@@ ships .
people lay a part of yourself open and that changes everything .
compare to compare it nowadays , it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if trips would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if you &apos;re looking for a group there would be a group there to show a group there and one of which one has never heard of a pu@@ ip@@ ent@@ our district , one of which has never heard :
or when you could learn from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed after the principle of privacy .
what if we &apos;d like to form the building from the ground ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of common part ?
I place some cities which allow us society and relation@@ ships , instead of sol@@ itude and isolation .
this project started in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , with lots of parking lots , which belonged to the government ,
the ro@@ omm@@ ates were offered now . students who were in search of a residence .
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were exp@@ elled . In@@ cu@@ b@@ ator programs were launched ,
in order to finance new start@@ ups in the Share economy . today , over our platform , 785 000 people will be able to host in 191 countries as a stran@@ ger or even hosts .
so the idea seems not to be so mad about how it was told us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality has also been given before .
there were similar websites before us .
so , why did our work well ?
apart from happiness and tim@@ ing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us to overcome deeply @-@ root pre@@ ju@@ dice .
I think it bl@@ ossom ,
straight to over@@ whel@@ ming .
anyway I have to think about it , if a red Mazda passes me over .
we naturally know that design can not solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I ask for what we might be coming soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe one sister .
or supp@@ ress , a bra@@ in@@ ist under@@ went , a ter@@ ror ist ?
or just a delay in security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the bl@@ ame for your negative impressions .
so the media exists , which look like me .
a study found that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know any Muslims .
pres@@ um@@ ably the people are not talking with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met any Muslims : it is great , you know .
I say to you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ h @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , for , baby , I was not born .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ge me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but for Muslims . I decided to carry off the H@@ ij@@ ab , my head@@ ings .
my femin@@ ist friends were ex@@ u@@ pted : &quot; why are you pressing yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : it was then to me a femin@@ ist independence of independence , although I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , making me a perfect and immen@@ se beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have ger@@ min@@ ed with the cor@@ an .
I read it , thought in question , was des@@ per@@ ate and believed ultim@@ ately .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and slow commitment to deep@@ en with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhyth@@ mi@@ k also brings me to turn .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perce@@ ive , you totally under@@ stands , and yet somehow fallen ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the mouth of the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had at the end of my breakfast , watching the screen and saw the word &quot; express . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes fle@@ w into buildings , people fle@@ w from buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical dis@@ order ?
my shock was rapidly transformed into indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should one do something ?
I changed the channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists , ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; Jih@@ ad ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only mine land being attacked , but in the n@@ ay related me the acts of others from one civil war into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to drive through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and to begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I had been laugh@@ ing -- so deep it went into my seat , and I dre@@ aming the first time when Muslims were recognised .
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations , which said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Se@@ ide careful , &quot; &quot; ble@@ eding out in well lit areas . &quot; &quot;
I stayed all the week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day to gather Muslims to prayer .
and again the war@@ nings said : &quot; not this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of coverage .
the feelings were discre@@ et and I heard of attacks of Muslims or people who kept for Muslims who was in the free cr@@ ushed and pl@@ agu@@ ed .
there really gave fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who had attacked this land , have attacked our land .
I picked up the anger of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was mad .
it is not easy to explain to itself .
I do not have questions , I love questions .
they are the acc@@ us@@ ations that are hard .
today we can say to people , &quot; There is a problem in this land -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get it ? &quot;
some people want to p@@ ans Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak from my commun@@ e like a tumor in the body of the USA .
there is only the question : are we vic@@ ious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is considered a whole and ben@@ ign tum@@ our you just observe under observation .
the altern@@ atives are sen@@ sel@@ ess , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inv@@ entor and teachers , educ@@ ator and Olymp@@ ion@@ iken .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but do not stop the ter@@ ror .
regular visits to a mos@@ que leads to people of other faith toler@@ ant to show greater citizens .
and as a head of the police in the Washington area , I recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cally radi@@ cally radi@@ cally .
they are radi@@ cally radi@@ alized in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
when the Radi@@ cal@@ isation process has seen that it begins online , even by her family , so that the person believes the terror@@ ists are ab@@ dic@@ ted , that the terror@@ ists should be h@@ iding the true Muslims , and everybody who appreciate their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
if we want to avoid radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some are still claim that Islam is a viol@@ ent religion .
in the end , a group looks like IS their brut@@ ality by the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a man , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their settings world as a representative of 1.6 billion of belie@@ vers .
thank you !
the IS has as much as to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christian@@ ity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you throw a look at them , they do not drive them in their &quot; Holy Script@@ ure . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into script@@ ure .
a memor@@ able im@@ am told me a amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they had advanced to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if she had been in touch with radi@@ cal religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit having spoken , brought her to silence , and told her that her wrath will bring her heart to in@@ justice in the world .
nothing inspired , anything inspired by her W@@ ut sense , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation of extrem@@ ists that you have given a solution .
this Im@@ am gave the connection to God and their commun@@ e again .
rather than compl@@ eting her anger , he showed her construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mos@@ que , kept it before joining the IS .
it was a gli@@ mp@@ se like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and my family concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies - show : if we fear , there are at least three things .
we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ces .
a study shows : when people demonstrated messages that were reported for Muslims in which negative matters were contrary to Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic issue .
if you &apos;re looking for the mood against Muslims from between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror@@ ist attacks .
it happened in the Vor@@ feld war of Ira@@ k@@ war and during two periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim ter@@ ror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manip@@ ulate the public to dis@@ able the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well @-@ known citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but toxic air of fear f@@ umes us all .
there is not just about to explain himself in the assignment of collective debt .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ s@@ men .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , tal@@ ented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet , most generous person who knew it .
she visited him and he showed her a res@@ ume . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did my brother become such a dist@@ orted young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , has been murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in her apartment , as in one execution , after he was post@@ pon@@ ed against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he was on De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be mor@@ ally , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mos@@ que or stayed certainly at home ?
we were pra@@ ying and for us it was not a light decision , because it was therefore that America we would like to leave our children , or one that we can exercise our religion in which we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we op@@ ted for the mos@@ que .
our son in the kinder@@ garten we ro@@ de with high pressure at the mos@@ que .
I took out it out , and my shoes went out into the pra@@ et@@ ahs , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am arose , and called our guests , for the half of the gathered Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ism , a@@ the@@ ists , belie@@ vers , and non @-@ belie@@ vers , who were come to attack , but to teach us .
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they had courage and comp@@ as@@ sion pan@@ ic and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go safe to number sure ?
or will join them , which my : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what you might say that you might think that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a historical monument , which is an exception , and not rule .
what would you say to some people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , let &apos;s not dece@@ ive . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
so , I am as usual as it is allowed .
looking at the Muslims around the world , and I did according to the world &apos;s largest ever @-@ guided study for Muslims in the world , people want normal things .
they want pro@@ sper@@ ity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am an exception in any way .
when people appear as a rule , usually the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ers began to be a Milli@@ ar@@ ist Shop .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible in research institutions worldwide .
before the air par@@ cel delivery in our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft at the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started to fly with ro@@ pes .
due to joining flight machines high speed and acceleration due to separate space .
they can also build independently adjustable structures .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in the autonomous flight .
so that a system worked aut@@ on@@ om , it must know a collective im@@ e@@ id where in space the mobile objects are located .
in our lab at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new locomotive technology of Ver@@ ity Studio , a branch of our labor@@ atories .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space , calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
external commands are available on the highest flat@@ e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail@@ er star@@ ters ,
a flight unit , which tries to beat two flying points with a fl@@ ap .
like other star@@ ters it is efficient , much more efficient than hel@@ icop@@ ters in all its variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can flo@@ at , and thus has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a fli@@ p@@ side .
a limitation of hat@@ chback is that they respon@@ d to tur@@ bul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit is able to recover the optimal location and improve the performance by practic@@ ing .
al@@ right now .
during our research we often provide some basic abstract issues that v@@ ass@@ ing the core of the cause v@@ ord@@ r@@ ingen .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts that sp@@ un on to hurt you .
before decades , pilots couldn &apos;t fly remote controlled air devices that only had two moving parts : a propeller and a rear side .
un@@ sett@@ ling we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner that mechan@@ ically sim@@ ulated and sim@@ ulated air@@ lines . it was invented in a short circuit .
it only has a moving part , a propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse , no other actuators or control surfaces , just a propeller .
although it &apos;s mechan@@ ically easy , in the interior are very much , so it can fly stable , and can move beyond the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear end . to bring it to the fly , I have to do it right .
the prob@@ ability we have exactly right to throw away when all of them is small , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in g@@ utter , this machine is here , the Omega sh@@ ole and its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess .
what to do with all of this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is symmetrical .
therefore , it is the equivalent in its orientation .
thus he maint@@ ains the great ability ,
to move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction he is rot@@ ated or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight Prop@@ ellers .
one @-@ piece is imag@@ in@@ able in models , the rest is ler@@ ned directly at the flies .
let us see that .
when air machines should be part of our daily life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin @-@ aircraft flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the others to clock@@ wise .
when one builds , they be@@ have as a high @-@ performance square .
however , somewhat wrong -- a motor or propeller is off , the electronics or one battery -- the machine can continue to fly if restricted .
we will now demonstr@@ ate that by doing half an air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration studied synthetic sp@@ ans .
the large number of autonomous , coordin@@ ated units makes a range of aesthetic expression .
we accepted standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit it with loc@@ ating technology and algorith@@ ms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . this is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstr@@ ations to re@@ think new revolutionary ideas .
an especially secure machine as slide you want to become a flying lamp on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types such as us is the sal@@ ary in the development and creative act .
it acts as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative and fun cre@@ atures to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential , is the door on the ridge .
thank you very much .
almost 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very dist@@ ant galax@@ y wander@@ ed in a very far away galax@@ y , they walked like the mass of three prob@@ es in a tenth of a pure energy .
for this short moment they brigh@@ tened brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
they don &apos;t put your energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was handed in into space @-@ time hab@@ itation , and explo@@ ded the universe in gra@@ vit@@ ational sw@@ ells .
we arrange the events in the first time .
some 1.3 billion years ago was just a majority of life on earth .
since then the earth has high@@ ligh@@ ted : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God arise at -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of Mu@@ eller - R@@ ai Weiss was decided by the MIT , K@@ ip Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser det@@ ectors that are created for gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes .
most of them stopped for crazy .
but enough people recognised them as a crazy gen@@ ies , so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades , construction , design and extremely much har@@ ter work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ric gra@@ vit@@ ational observ@@ atory .
in the following time , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which improved its recognition rate trem@@ end@@ ously .
so you call it Advanced Lig@@ o now .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run by some smaller , stu@@ b@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commission@@ ing of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational sw@@ ells of the two co@@ c@@ ating black holes caused by the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well to my father &apos;s father .
the fruits of my life had been in essence .
all this , wher@@ ever I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colle@@ ague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been investig@@ ated by gra@@ vit@@ ational sw@@ amps as Lig@@ o meas@@ ur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a cr@@ us@@ ement in the structure of space and time .
by passing the shaft , the space and its contents are stretched into a direction and put into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lecturer in courses for relative theory is often a real light of dance .
&quot; expan@@ sions and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the issue is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational sw@@ ells are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each one of us was stretched while performances of the waves and the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by one 1 , the lig@@ o staff stated for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and this is already ab@@ sur@@ d , this length must be precisely measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a nuclear core . this is Gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on grav@@ itation
described K@@ ip Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s , the h@@ unt for the waves follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such det@@ ectors are trem@@ end@@ ous .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are final and with the support of public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
return to Lig@@ o . scott claims to see Lig@@ o is more ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : face , the size of your cell phone .
this is quite handy . so you can make a picture or a map of things by talking about many points coming around you .
it is different with tones .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
therefore it is very difficult to make a picture of things , which invol@@ ve you very much :
the face of your child approximately .
instead we listen to specific properties like tape and height , rhythm and volume to close the story .
&quot; now Alice speaks at Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interru@@ pts them . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob &quot; .
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational sw@@ ells .
we cannot make any simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by changing the changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are within audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave pattern in sound , we can listen to all the all literally .
the gravity , too loud , can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes so that my colle@@ ague Scott tells me very long .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , p . pen simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same type of sound with an extra sound change . that &apos;s so on : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of motion , engraved in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that I must never forget -- heard Lig@@ o Fol@@ low@@ ing : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; , knowing this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black sol@@ dering of 30 @-@ fold sun , which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the brigh@@ test body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ net a whole new way to expl@@ oring the al@@ ls , as never before .
on this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible .
much in space we can not see -- prac@@ tically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ e@@ facts are explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about all .
the exciting physical processes are done in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through from there , since that op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational sw@@ amps penet@@ rate iron , as it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the pri@@ mor@@ sky is covered by its own g@@ low lumin@@ aires .
by means of gra@@ vit@@ ational sw@@ ells it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and probably the most important : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things that we will never see and of which we don &apos;t have to see . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found equal in the first approach , which we did not expect .
my colle@@ ague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars which ob@@ serving black holes are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe .
they are trem@@ end@@ ous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to add the sau@@ erk@@ raut for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o makes us a completely different view of view of events in space , on the emer@@ gence of stars and ultim@@ ately as we emerged from that chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be bra@@ ve as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and the pen of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observation activities -- a completely new generation of Observ@@ atory on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than the ur@@ ine of yourself ?
now is time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
for one year I would like to say &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of that I was afraid .
no matter if it was ner@@ vous , I brought me in un@@ pleasant situations I for@@ give me &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I wanted to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
would I like to start playing with the foam ?
no , no , no , but yes , ye@@ ah , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fe@@ ared because I was afraid .
my anx@@ i@@ ety linked to keep my social fear -- pu@@ ff , path .
the power of a word is awesome .
&quot; Yes &quot; my life changed .
&quot; Yes &quot; I changed .
but there was a certain Yes which changed my life changed to an un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly art . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for all &quot; estimate &quot; , &quot;
for they would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; I don &apos;t need milk for my snor@@ k@@ ation . &quot;
she asked her to play if I could play with her when I was just on the leap . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I am sw@@ am to play with them as soon as you want to do with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or wh@@ ither I go , I say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am tired very much .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has a blo@@ oming side effect : just before short , I actually understood that &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ s@@ akes to play my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things off , aw@@ ake you for life .
wonderful job .
no .
I am a Titan .
wonderful job .
I create TV . I &apos;m producing TV .
I &apos;m doing television , in big style .
in this TV season I am responsible for taking over 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that previously not existed .
the budget of an TV channel ep@@ is@@ ode can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new ep@@ is@@ ode for all nine days four days , i.e. every nine days 20 million TV , four programmes , which are at the same time ; 24 events : grey &apos;s , 21 ep@@ iso@@ des : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 ep@@ iso@@ des : the C@@ atch , 70 Hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows a succ@@ ession on Thursday night .
throughout the world , my series are running in 67 languages for 30 million vie@@ wers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV lessons are broad@@ casts , which I have created themselves , and not only produces time , really st@@ ille , creative time to gather my fans for bon@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , around the world .
do you know who else is doing ?
no one , because I am a Titan .
wonderful job .
I would not want to im@@ press you .
I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author falls . &quot;
I say it to you , that all of you are working as hard if you speak a company , a country or a class@@ room , to learn it , that I am not only true to your computer , and it is true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything swe@@ at -- no te@@ ars .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I de@@ eper into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it is when I set troops , when I bet on a canvas .
as a dream you dream a high tone , a marathon .
one feels like Bey@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , st@@ ress@@ ful , st@@ ress@@ ful , st@@ ily and mot@@ her@@ ing , clin@@ ically and mot@@ her@@ ly , cru@@ el and sen@@ sible , and the best thing is to s@@ ums .
there is such a change in me when the work is good .
a s@@ ums begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the s@@ ums he@@ ars like a busy road , and I could go on you .
many people take when I decl@@ are the sum , I think about it , that writing me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but when I began to work and work when I started to work and work , I began to work and work , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the s@@ ums !
it is more than the writing .
the s@@ ums is action and activity . the s@@ ums is a drug .
the s@@ ums is music . the s@@ ums is light and air .
the s@@ ums is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a s@@ ums , you can not strike your way .
the feeling , do not feel different , regardless of size , care for which price .
it is called the Sum@@ men .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s called E@@ go .
perhaps it is fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not for bar@@ iton , and I only know that I love the Sum@@ ums .
I will only say you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it to ask .
in order to be a clear : ever more transm@@ is@@ ations , the more broad@@ casts , the more things more ep@@ iso@@ des , the more things are the same , the more things I watch , the more things I write off history , so more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more must work myself .
and what did I say about work ?
I love this , not true ?
the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , sum@@ ums , s@@ ums , s@@ ums .
I like this sum . I love the s@@ ums .
I need the s@@ ums . I am the sum .
am I only this Sum@@ ums ?
and then the s@@ ums stopped .
revised , over@@ drawn , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the tot@@ als stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ om@@ ed to the truth that their mom@@ my mo@@ m is a unique working range .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Absol@@ ut , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ Land . &quot;
these are the children of an TI@@ TAN@@ EN .
they are Baby TI@@ TAN@@ EN .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the s@@ ums stopped .
the sum of the engine is blocked .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the s@@ ums did not come back .
my sum was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same TI@@ TAN@@ EN work , 15 hours @-@ days , permanent weekends , no re@@ mor@@ ing not deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not based on , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ up @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the s@@ ums and the Sum@@ ma I was .
so , what does one do if you do , the work which you love , suddenly leave ?
I know , some may think , &quot; He@@ ul yourself , stu@@ pid of the author Titan . &quot;
but you know , you are doing how to be one teacher you do , one painter , a ban@@ ker to be , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to feel the sum , when you knew the s@@ ums when the Sum@@ ma stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song listen to my heart , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states K@@ ell@@ ad@@ ress &quot; represents me a question .
I &apos;m on the way outside , late and she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you play ? &quot;
and I will tell you no more than two things to be aware of :
first , I must say yes to all , and second , she called me not &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
it calls no longer &quot; estimate &quot; .
when did that happen ?
I leave it when I am Titan bin and my s@@ ums bet@@ ere , and here everything happens before my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; Yes . &quot;
nothing is special about it .
we play and their sisters push , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read altogether dram@@ atically from the book &quot; Every@@ body P@@ oo@@ ps . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude and lack of s@@ ums , I can do nothing but watch out .
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I &apos;m silent .
the land , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exists , stick@@ y fingers and dam@@ n k@@ iss@@ es , tender voices , cra@@ yons , and song , in which it end@@ ums go out , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly bre@@ a@@ the .
I can hardly believe that I am at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something that dis@@ sol@@ ves in me .
a mental door goes up and an energy head comes in .
and that &apos;s not right , but it happens .
I feel it .
the s@@ ums is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum , but a sum .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with us .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the s@@ ums , the work@@ manship , the titanium dioxide , that is only the subst@@ itute .
if I ask you , if I am saying , who am I , if I am talking about using broad@@ casts and TV stations and how working my brain , then I have forgotten what is the real sum .
the s@@ ums is no power and it is not working .
it depends on the pleasure .
true s@@ ums is dependent on the love .
sum@@ ums is the current , which comes from the life .
the real money is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real summ@@ its are ig@@ no@@ red the pressure of history , which are related tasks , expect@@ ation and printing .
the real s@@ ums is simple and original .
the real s@@ ums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe I per@@ su@@ ed to God the wrong words , for what God said to me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes .
I am doing this , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the s@@ ums .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play in my way as working as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I am always working because I love it .
I am better at the workplace as home .
this conc@@ ession is pain@@ ful , for what a man is better than to be home ?
well , I know .
once more hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , is none of it .
we gr@@ ate around in the garden , before and back , go and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we have d@@ ashed soap bu@@ bbles .
I feel mainly st@@ iff , ab@@ using and conf@@ used .
I always agree to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children tell me how you live , and the s@@ ums of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can also say it ! tell you yes when your child would like to play with you .
maybe you hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day@@ time .
well , you &apos;re right , but you can do it !
you have time !
and why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show @-@ figure .
your child can be found less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they think they want to make something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
and speaks my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me , am I Mother of the Year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need not need .
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad @-@ wh@@ ale day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no deposit .
the day is short : dinner , finished children .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ illed !
my kids are my feeling of pro@@ sper@@ ity , my world . it does not have to be the children . it goes to feel the s@@ ums to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not going to play with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play &quot; in general .
leave the 15 minutes !
find out what &apos;s doing good for you .
find out and keep it up .
I &apos;m not perfect in what I &apos;m going about . I &apos;ll find books to read books , read the day --
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got my first TV show when I wanted to make myself more and more .
15 minutes a copy , why do not treat full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the s@@ ums came back in my spare time . the s@@ ums seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
works not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door open up in and I find myself in my office . I have met me and my soul . I gu@@ ess me to new ideas . I use it in full bre@@ ast@@ ers and love my work again .
I like the s@@ ums , but I do not love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum , s@@ ums is not me ... no more .
soap Bu@@ bbles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends .
that is now my sum .
the s@@ ums of life .
the Sum@@ ums of Love .
the s@@ ums of labour is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so gr@@ ate@@ ful .
it is me , that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and play .
but still , I have everything in control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the cle@@ ar@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the more I &apos;m working .
the more I play , the more I hear the s@@ ums , the land that I run , the marathon , which I run , the arm@@ ies , the sum , the sum , s@@ ums , the sum , the s@@ ums , the s@@ ums of life .
the more I feel like this s@@ ums , the more makes this unusual , im@@ aging , naked and new feeling of life in me . less titanium - more I !
the more I feel exactly this s@@ ums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things I aw@@ ake you to life .
this belongs to the job , that means to live its dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ y .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and play more .
TI@@ TAN@@ EN have no chance here .
&quot; will you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am a neuro@@ surgical surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after an accident .
for us Neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ help .
after a heavy injury of central ner@@ vous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy dis@@ ability .
that is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve ner@@ ve functions through different surgical techniques .
surely it is one of the most well @-@ known one , the &quot; depth brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; there you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to react to the control circuits of ne@@ ur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson , who suffered severe trem@@ bling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with something help , the brain can help itself .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading the doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that the brain trau@@ ma @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a has to imagine the brain and cran@@ ial pressure .
to save the life , you have to reduce the sk@@ in@@ scription .
for this one has to remove a piece of sw@@ ol@@ len brain mass .
rather than the sw@@ ol@@ len brain mass , we decided to analy@@ ze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not a slight task .
the cells of a tissue should grow , is comparable to all small children who are taken out of their families .
you must find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to th@@ rive on them .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many looking , it was Jean @-@ François .
that he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a master cell culture . with great green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ rip@@ e cells .
maybe you know that stem cells are un@@ rip@@ e cells , that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small n@@ iche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells out of the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we had a further fascinating observation : normal regular cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells refer to a different manner .
they di@@ pped themselves gradually and after a few weeks they died even .
so we saw a new , strange cell numbers that looked like stem cells but was different .
we needed long to understand how they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cere@@ br@@ al sequ@@ ences .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the separation of the brain .
but why stay they get us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations near the brain injury .
but that is not so sure .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our regular cells .
we stand before a potential cell source , which allows the healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of bra@@ ins from the non @-@ l@@ ingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did
and then , then marked in color , to track them in the brain .
in the last step we ro@@ de it in the centre of the same individuals .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ splant@@ ation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splant@@ ation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re@@ im@@ ply these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re@@ im@@ pl@@ ate the same cells in your brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we broke out the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were back home after some weeks , they would have been taken back home . they &apos;re not needed there , so they will dis@@ appear there .
in the second scenario , we added a injury and rec@@ tif@@ ou@@ ted exactly the same cells and now , the cells remained -- it increased ne@@ ur@@ ons to mature ne@@ ur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show , are these little points . these are the cells that we in vitro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
will these cells help a mon@@ key to recover from one brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill .
they had to take food pellets from one tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable cre@@ ature level , we ultim@@ ately had the motor@@ ized cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hands anymore .
exactly as it would happen for people , they improved spont@@ ane@@ ously up to some degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to f@@ etch it with the help of plastic brain mechan@@ isms . they recover themselves at some degree as the monkeys .
when we sure that the mon@@ key had reached his degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the mon@@ key who was spont@@ aneous .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not that precise , and not so fast .
now , when we ro@@ asted the cells : the same mon@@ key , two months after implant@@ ation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting for us .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze and use it later .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for instance with Par@@ kinson &apos;s .
but our dream is still to im@@ mobil@@ ize them while people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain has the resources to cure himself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure to think several do@@ zen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know anyone who can use . &quot;
I definitely will definitely .
of course the question , which are the biggest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting with this great results you need to complete about two kilograms papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is clear , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : Yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and almost a professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to have permission to start clinical trials . if you want to look into the future as many years it will take until someone can come into hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it already takes a long time to choose the patients to make treatment and ass@@ ess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ core study .
you must first prove that it is useful before we can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is sure of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting with TED and that you told us .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the west make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy as the break@@ able plant which is in reality , but as Inv@@ entory of our society .
we tend to consider her as a change to change .
we believe capitalism is in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably leading to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w from Singapore and his huge desc@@ endants in Beijing have no doubt that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capital@@ ist and impressive growth while the policy is totally un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I realized Greece - the newly elected Greek government - was un@@ equ@@ iv@@ oc@@ al to me that the democratic process of our country -- Our elections -- Our elections -- not the au@@ ster@@ ity that were realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Communist Party of China , or some of my exc@@ ited friends , which would say to me if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy .
I pray you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a Ir@@ r@@ believe , we could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ective democracy .
for without democracy , our s@@ oc@@ ieties are w@@ asted , our future , and our great new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the subject of waste , I want to point you at an interesting contra@@ diction , which currently threat@@ ens our activity .
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit Parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recogn@@ ise him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg which thro@@ ws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but only few recognize his twin .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belong to the un@@ used au@@ ster@@ ity and corpor@@ ations , to invest it there might be productive and in@@ comes , which one could produce it and also all the things could produce , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 billion dollars were invested in the U.S. , in England and in the Eurozone , such as industrial plants , machinery , office building , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 Billi@@ ons US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es the same time to the same time in the same countries and our financial instit@@ utes , and absolutely nothing did , except the ex@@ changes to bl@@ ame and up@@ ward the property prices .
debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit that is not the same due to the usual market mechan@@ isms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circumstances lead to the circumstances occurr@@ ing that econom@@ ist lets him k@@ ills him .
this is my h@@ ad@@ age with capitalism --
his extremely high @-@ productive capital should be used to enhance our lives , human tal@@ ents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is the democracy change ?
I think already . but before we continue : what do we understand for democracy ?
A@@ rist@@ otel@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form , in which the city and the poor as a majority of the government control .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy grew up too many , of course --
women , fore@@ ign@@ ers , and of course sl@@ aves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the anc@@ ies of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these statements .
the making of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she was not only the right to employment a free speech , but important and decisive is that they had the right to political participation with equal voice @-@ weigh@@ ting in issues of state governments .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was not kept for a long time --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is also rapidly burnt .
however , our liberal democracy have not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glor@@ ious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American const@@ itution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy grew more concentrated on the free citizens , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultim@@ ately was a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress .
for the liberal democracy was only visible when a complete separation of politics and economy possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered by politics , while the economy is the world of the concert - a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our present @-@ time democr@@ ac@@ ies have been found since the time in which this separation of politics and economy began to pursu@@ e an in@@ ex@@ able struggle between the two , as the economy gradually emig@@ rated to politics and dis@@ posed them .
do you adm@@ ire why the polit@@ icians are not the same as before ?
it lies not at a Deg@@ en@@ er@@ ation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my h@@ ad@@ men with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in approximately as such a flock of cra@@ dles , which is so sustain@@ ably the animals of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they were star@@ ved at the end .
simil@@ arly , it is similar to the economy that the politics dis@@ continued as far as the power of the corpor@@ ations itself . the power of corpor@@ ations is growing , political conf@@ essions will grow and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are to be anx@@ ious to invest the cash of their companies .
according to capital@@ ist capitalism , the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ elled , the higher are the twin summit , and so is greater the waste of human labor power and pro@@ sper@@ ity of humanity .
if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we must return to politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; de@@ eds , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the excl@@ usion of sl@@ aves , women and fore@@ ign@@ ers .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bit of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only be recovered by a mir@@ acle in ancient Athens , without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism is doing by low cost @-@ construction employees through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long business and policy of separate areas , the automation can be higher , the waste of the twin ones , and the social conflic@@ ts lower , as it is -- soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we must transform the economy and as@@ sign the fields of economy and politics again , and we ass@@ ess the re@@ un@@ ified area hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy which leaves the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation .
so the question is not , whether capitalism has brought the technical achie@@ vements that it has produced , will survive --
the interesting question is whether capitalism is res@@ c@@ ashed by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; , or by something that the company shall serve the human being in the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient athl@@ ete &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long con@@ vers@@ ations of the sense of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; like U@@ top@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the area of the company : Ask a capital market before you works , while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
all income comes from capital and income , and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinc@@ tion more between those who belong to the company , but workers that work there are not owned there , but the company does not belong to them , but no large g@@ aps between investment and chips , and ultim@@ ately no emp@@ t twin rounds .
in the area of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a free changing exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Mon@@ etary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 biggest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all mankind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government pay the sum , which corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the mer@@ chant of the respective country .
imagine that this fund is invest@@ ing in green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funds are r@@ ar .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed to the Bret@@ ton Woo@@ ds Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we , especially in front of the background of a re@@ un@@ ified policy and economy .
the world I describe it is the same time the secre@@ tary , in which she privileg@@ ed people prefer , and mar@@ x@@ ist , because they are buried in the separation of capital and work in the gar@@ bage can of history , and ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian@@ isch , globally ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian@@ isch .
but above all , it is a world where we could imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or are we sin@@ king in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to polit@@ ically decide .
it is in our hands and we do better even democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how does Marx &apos;@@ Analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ un@@ ification of politics and business ... do not doing this , the technological development will create a massive decrease in mac@@ ro@@ economic demand as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis a part of Earth is to the next as we can see it is not only our democr@@ ac@@ ies to dest@@ abil@@ ize , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely conf@@ used .
BG : in fact , and now we are there .
Y@@ V : if you are not conf@@ used , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clear what you think of the view of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hyp@@ oc@@ ris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ ac@@ ies we have the appro@@ ve of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have spent democracy in politics , during the area where most of the economy is playing , -- the area of the economy -- a completely corporate @-@ free zone .
in some respec@@ ts , if I may say the prov@@ oc@@ ative , China res@@ em@@ bles today the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect to liber@@ alism and democracy -- this is an error , histor@@ ically considered .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
it was especially ske@@ p@@ tical that affects the democratic development .
what can be observed now in China , res@@ em@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China is now prefer@@ able to do what the West has done themselves in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of hyp@@ oc@@ ris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I wonder that this is coming .
BG : Yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view@@ point , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make the Eurozone with a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone ,
namely , the compl@@ ac@@ ency was to say goo@@ db@@ ye , and per@@ sever@@ ing sus@@ pic@@ ion , that proce@@ eded by the euro zone , and continues to mas@@ sively at@@ tract the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek inc@@ ense -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion which revealed this understanding --
right to do . unfortunately , the powers in the euro@@ zone , within the euro@@ zone , continues to den@@ y the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system which is un@@ able to gain political will and author@@ it@@ ism to life , it might be a while , but if the change occurs , he happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ struc@@ tive .
BG : what changes are you ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : have you made any mist@@ akes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone , who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or some minister , who claimed after 6 months in office , in particular in an so @-@ called situation , he didn &apos;t have made mist@@ akes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the biggest def@@ ect was to sign the application for extending the extension programme to the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ est interest in pages of monetary effect to find a common solution .
but this was not .
they wanted to bring only our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with conf@@ ections that were left through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t know that it had been a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than the &quot; Great De@@ pression . &quot;
nobody from the Tro@@ ika of money , who encour@@ aged us this policy , and a : &quot; that was a kol@@ os@@ sal@@ er mist@@ akes . &quot;
BG : despite all these , and despite the aggressive rush of con@@ vers@@ ations , you seem to be quite a European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my critic@@ ism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from som@@ eb@@ ody who lives in Europe and loves .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
because when they are not alive , the super@@ vised fli@@ ck@@ ering will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not alone have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences alone , but for the global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we ple@@ ad ourselves to re@@ ject the way of a post@@ modern 1930 that it appears , it will also be the best for Europeans &apos;s future as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you lie in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you so that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of Roy Price still has never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for many of you .
that &apos;s going back to the decision , the Roy arrived three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive staff at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Techn@@ ique , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and the content , which is going to produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard fought sector .
there are so many TV series that Roy does not choose anything .
he must find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows which are right on this curve .
this curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the web site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 a.m. and the height shows how many shows will get this review .
will be valu@@ ed at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ ted , where to ask for a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there more of these ep@@ iso@@ des ? &quot;
this sort of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows are like &quot; To@@ d@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not answer him to the left side of the curve , because I think you have already had special intelli@@ gence to teach &quot; To@@ d@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the mean explo@@ itation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they do not insp@@ ire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the print is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon was doing something , therefore Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk .
he wants to draw successes .
he requires guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses by an analysis of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first ep@@ is@@ ode of this shows where they can watch them online .
and if Amazon find out free things , you &apos;re going to do right ?
millions of vie@@ wers look at these ep@@ iso@@ des .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are watching the shows of these shows .
they will be watched by Roy and his team that record everything .
they capture when you start the show when one p@@ auses that parts one jumps . look at once again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data then to produce which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect data , process this and hence the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com for four re@@ publi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
Yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because they were not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- when the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House reached 7.5 -- so something above the average , but not exactly the in@@ scription of Roy and his team worked out .
for about the same time in another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . its name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming from Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is he always in search for this a super show and it is also used data for it but it does something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team looked to the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so reviews they give the shows that they like to like them etc .
then use these data to find these little details about the spect@@ ators : what shows they like what producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went a venture , and decided to make a Sit@@ com for four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about an Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
Yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has suffered a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 review on this curve . so that &apos;s exactly where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data recorded companies .
they combine this many data together and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic had somehow been said that it should work with everything .
if one has collected millions of data for a decision which one meets , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you can optim@@ ise it by very powerful computers .
the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis is not working , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we can gra@@ b more and more in time to make serious cho@@ ices far beyond television .
does someone knows here the Multi @-@ Health System ?
no . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health System is a software company and I hope that no one comes into touch with this software . come in contact with this software .
if any one is in prison in the USA and for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is being used to determine if a dis@@ mis@@ sal is or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , if one person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
sorry , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results produced . this is not the case that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data @-@ to @-@ evalu@@ ate firms are also wrong .
Yes , even Google does sometimes cause mist@@ akes .
2009 , Google known that they can pre@@ di@@ ct through data analysis out@@ breaks of fl@@ u , the worse way -- through data analysis of Google services .
it worked wonderful and was a great news sens@@ ation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year round , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sens@@ ation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
the data to inter@@ c@@ ate firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something .
in spite of all these errors the data flows into account a -- at the workplace , in the process of law , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I am working on the computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- a field , with some very smart people un@@ imag@@ in@@ able to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . I have noticed some samples on the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be common .
have you ever resol@@ ve a complex problem , do you mainly do two things :
when design@@ ing this problem in his individual parts , so that you can analyse the single parts ; as a second place you put the items together to capture a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and back together .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help you destroy a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suited to put the parts back and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have : our brain .
when there is something that is good for the brain , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is in@@ complete to summar@@ ize a good dis@@ course -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and mind , where they also belong to the process .
they use data to get their audience better , what else would have not been able to get all these parts , and it will return to a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they went a very personal risk of this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong ways .
they used data to take all their decisions first , when they sque@@ ez@@ ed TV ideas as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it didn &apos;t lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions but I think things are wrong , when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before it was written , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ Question you just have to shake the ball for a response . &quot; highly probably &quot; -- this moment is this moment . &quot;
I will join it later with a demo demo .
I have met some decisions in my life , where@@ by I should have heard in hind@@ sight into the ball .
but , as you don &apos;t know if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much more extrac@@ ted , like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic configuration .
so , perhaps the ball bo@@ unds and so@@ unding . ultim@@ ately it is coming to us to make decisions when we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encour@@ aging message that it is still paying off , despite the great quantity of data , making decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks .
for by the end there are not the data , but the risks , with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
