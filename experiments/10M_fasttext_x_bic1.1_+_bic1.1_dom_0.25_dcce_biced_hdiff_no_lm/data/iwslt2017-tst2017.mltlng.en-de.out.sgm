<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New-York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before somebody heard by Edward Snowden, Risen has written a book in which he pronounced striking telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US-secret operation in which the CIA in Iran was literally surrendered to a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know, whom does the chapter not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has established against Risen and call him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train he became a symbol for the patterns of the government, Whistleblower to condemn the journalists and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Complaints, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, it is impossible to address this right when media cannot get this information, when they cannot protect the identity of the muds.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was fuelled when Risen was, he did something that many muaky reporter had before him; he refused, saying that he would prefer to go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen has lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been essential for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring, the reporter and the sources can still be less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of flightning and penises to speak, this also might do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigator, without his consent, had taken care of his phone.</seg>
<seg id="21">Exactly like his email data, financial and bank information, its origin, and even itineraries with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and cracking.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised him to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the justice was convicted more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that one can be a problem, especially because the government is too much harlot of their work as being secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since the 11th of September almost every article about national security was the result of that a whistleblower went to a journalists.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the press work out of the game, which shall be protected by the first constituent because the government has more possibilities to express all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government allows to handle rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">Indeed, you may contact it from the moment in which they are contact, rather than in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which was not yet written as Risen, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is Securedrop, an open-source transmission system for Whistleblower that was originally developed by the internet presence, which was developed by us by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working on by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of e-mail, enter a news web site, like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, such as with every contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the respective News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot get more sensitive information, and many of the information they would require it would not be available from it in.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments over the world always develop new spy technologies that all endanger ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is sure to ensure that not only the technology employed as Edward Snowden have a possibility to assign a misfortune. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="39">The effect of abuse during the supply of soldiers scissed white and of crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for the infected water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">Anyway, these technologies have not only been made for those who wish to cover crime, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data collection of history have been published.] ["Panama Papers"] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for a statement.] this week we were able to run by messages over a rectangle of 11 million documents in Panama's resident law firm mosum Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents have a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossy Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, exchange messages, such as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are reports that a ally, the ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has spelled peaches in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russia's President Vladimir Putin goes on a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others give nervous to the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">This sounds like the plot of a service of agencies or John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems also cries from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we approach that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and weakness are able to hide it in tax havens, and not all taxes you pay for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the world, we discuss the media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few, you may hide and veil be something that we have been discussing and reveal it for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think so many people will make this whole world very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I imagine it as a Matrjoschcapituppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company what it will nearly impossible to understand who's behind those prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutors and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, what is thing.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans who had previously reported in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans, who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mossy Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have had a data collection of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US-States you need less information to give a company to start a company as to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed to pick up people from debt districts, to pick up school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed to convert any annovolous investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior, which concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered warming into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our agent in African ministers agreed to bring a house to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked all that all up to one lawyer in our investigator suggestions how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">This was all prevalent. no one of these lawyers accepted us as a client, and of course no one was committed to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as a single accidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer, who has been spreading to our concealed surveys.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politic, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It works as the system works, through corruption, tax cursed, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the game rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to create this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very much more meaningful as if we could do nothing but if nothing has changed; as if there is always the rich and weakness.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as being born optimist, I truly see that something has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years, we have seen lectures to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has captured the central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the U.S. is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used to ensure a global increase in the US and global transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headaches.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who appreciate the problem and end it by law through the laws of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Along with us, we can finally stop this type of tax cursed, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is history as I am almost kidnapped and in the boot room of a red Mazthat would be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a deposit for sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was only in the city alone and made a roadtrip through the whole country. after that he would go to peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the invoice, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know it yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just learned it! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he is going to do it. I don't want to land in the boot time of a Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot time!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head saying, "Have, such as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I kept staring at the ceiling, and said, "Oh man! what have I filed for me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is going crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, in the tenth peaks to the door, and my sleep door lock.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he bought from me, hangs in his classroom. he is a teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold in my childhood as a stranger, actually friends who waited only for waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People used on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate attracts and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in town. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, anxiety walking into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have outlined something that we could stay to a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can sleep with us, Wi-fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham-cream tusetts, we tasted completely different because we did for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell, starred Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discover that we could find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a concept of business.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we would like to create a site on the people publicly presented their bedrooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors can come by.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would fail.</seg>
<seg id="142">But indeed, they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one, who is still at Trost, would invest in a shop, the strangers are allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, you mind the things that you can do. we could be desirable.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a KOSTPROBE, what kind of trust we aim.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it is out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Insert your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet footed of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when she first opened the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to stop the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="162">So feel most of the guests if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who really has Al Gores cell phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you be announced on Twitter, that he can fight for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor should have imagined with his name; if he would have told whence he is coming, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 evidence that they all say: "he can hold very well-locked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you have to cancel your phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to admit negatives.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until the host as well as guests had provided their departments, before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">We discovered something new last week.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted an study with Stanford. we examined, how probably it is that people trust in one another, depending on how they are in terms of age and homes.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little less surprising we trust the people most, who are the most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social system.</seg>
<seg id="181">In our case, it will be exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three departments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But you have more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation boasts common commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Besides, we rode that confidence is dependent on how much one is priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the responses to the first message of a host.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little how "Hi!" you're no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Too much, as for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle" art in your apartment! I'm doing holiday with my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design that produce a degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write anything.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help you overcome our advantages over foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">By what we had not expected, the great number of people that were more than ready to place these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people will take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need that had previously been previously uncovered.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the shop runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there is also times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated the unauthorized parties or apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have put guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front line, if trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it's woe when I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, who hears in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, the 123 million oversized nights had only a fraction ever a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">They trusted in each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it can arise in Wonderland.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to go to heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are genuine protective gel that saves a life, even though they do not know it at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You ride a hospital in your own hospital, if you die, and waiting for a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to be lonely, they get books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave a even longer stay without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This way, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economical trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it's just simply called "rental industry" but the thing is not just being justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of yourself open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">Compare to compare it nowadays, it's efficient and reliable, but it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if trips would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if you're looking for a group there would be a group there to show a group there and one of which one has never heard of a puipentour district, one of which has never heard:</seg>
<seg id="233">Or when you could learn from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed after the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we'd like to form the building from the ground?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I place some cities which allow us society and relationships, instead of solitude and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project started in South Korea's capital Seoul, with lots of parking lots, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">The roommates were offered now. students who were in search of a residence.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were expelled. Incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new startups in the Share economy. today, over our platform, 785 000 people will be able to host in 191 countries as a stranger or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be so mad about how it was told us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has also been given before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So, why did our work well?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeply-root prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it blossom,</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Anyway I have to think about it, if a red Mazda passes me over.</seg>
<seg id="253">We naturally know that design can not solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I ask for what we might be coming soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe one sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppress, a brainist underwent, a terror ist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media exists, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people are not talking with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met any Muslims: it is great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchteh-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, for, baby, I was not born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ouge me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but for Muslims. I decided to carry off the Hijab, my headings.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were exupted: "why are you pressing yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: it was then to me a feminist independence of independence, although I felt as 17-year-old, making me a perfect and immense beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have germined with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought in question, was desperate and believed ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and slow commitment to deepen with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythmik also brings me to turn.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceive, you totally understands, and yet somehow fallen?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the Egyptians, my career as a engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the mouth of the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had at the end of my breakfast, watching the screen and saw the word "express."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people flew from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock was rapidly transformed into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists,..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "Jihad..."... "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only mine land being attacked, but in the nay related me the acts of others from one civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and to begin with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I had been laughing -- so deep it went into my seat, and I dreaming the first time when Muslims were recognised.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations, which said: "be vigilant," "Seide careful," "bleeding out in well lit areas." "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed all the week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day to gather Muslims to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings said: "not this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were discreet and I heard of attacks of Muslims or people who kept for Muslims who was in the free crushed and plagued.</seg>
<seg id="311">There really gave fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this land, have attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I picked up the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was mad.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain to itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I do not have questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can say to people, "There is a problem in this land -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to pans Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak from my commune like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">There is only the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: malignant tumor is considered a whole and benign tumour you just observe under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, educator and Olympioniken.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque leads to people of other faith tolerant to show greater citizens.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in the Washington area, I recently told: people are actually not radically radically radically.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radically radialized in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the Radicalisation process has seen that it begins online, even by her family, so that the person believes the terrorists are abdicted, that the terrorists should be hiding the true Muslims, and everybody who appreciate their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to avoid radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">In the end, a group looks like IS their brutality by the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a man, as a person, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their settings world as a representative of 1.6 billion of believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has as much as to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you throw a look at them, they do not drive them in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">A memorable imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they had advanced to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if she had been in touch with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit having spoken, brought her to silence, and told her that her wrath will bring her heart to injustice in the world.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired, anything inspired by her Wut sense, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation of extremists that you have given a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam gave the connection to God and their commune again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than completing her anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, kept it before joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was a glimpse like the Islamophobia and my family concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscience studies - show: if we fear, there are at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when people demonstrated messages that were reported for Muslims in which negative matters were contrary to Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic issue.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you're looking for the mood against Muslims from between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the Vorfeld war of Irakwar and during two periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to disable the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well-known citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but toxic air of fear fumes us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">There is not just about to explain himself in the assignment of collective debt.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most sweet, most generous person who knew it.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him and he showed her a resume. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did my brother become such a distorted young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, has been murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in her apartment, as in one execution, after he was postponed against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He was on Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be morally, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or stayed certainly at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We were praying and for us it was not a light decision, because it was therefore that America we would like to leave our children, or one that we can exercise our religion in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">Our son in the kindergarten we rode with high pressure at the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took out it out, and my shoes went out into the praetahs, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam arose, and called our guests, for the half of the gathered Christians, Jews, Buddhism, atheists, believers, and non-believers, who were come to attack, but to teach us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go safe to number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will join them, which my: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a Nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you might say that you might think that you are a TEDTalk, a historical monument, which is an exception, and not rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to some people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, let's not deceive. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">So, I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking at the Muslims around the world, and I did according to the world's largest ever-guided study for Muslims in the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear as a rule, usually the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: many thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Basters began to be a Milliarist Shop.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air parcel delivery in our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Due to joining flight machines high speed and acceleration due to separate space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build independently adjustable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system worked autonom, it must know a collective imeid where in space the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new locomotive technology of Verity Studio, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on the highest flate. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tailer starters,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight unit, which tries to beat two flying points with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and thus has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a flipside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hatchback is that they respond to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit is able to recover the optimal location and improve the performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Alright now.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often provide some basic abstract issues that vassing the core of the cause vordringen.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts that spun on to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Before decades, pilots couldn't fly remote controlled air devices that only had two moving parts: a propeller and a rear side.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unsettling we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner that mechanically simulated and simulated airlines. it was invented in a short circuit.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and transverse, no other actuators or control surfaces, just a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it's mechanically easy, in the interior are very much, so it can fly stable, and can move beyond the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear end. to bring it to the fly, I have to do it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability we have exactly right to throw away when all of them is small, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is an exercise in gutter, this machine is here, the Omega shole and its eight propellers, an exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all of this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is the equivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he maintains the great ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in space in all directions, no matter in which direction he is rotated or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight Propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">One-piece is imaginable in models, the rest is lerned directly at the flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When air machines should be part of our daily life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin-aircraft flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others to clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds, they behave as a high-performance square.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, somewhat wrong -- a motor or propeller is off, the electronics or one battery -- the machine can continue to fly if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by doing half an airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic spans.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units makes a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted standard micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit it with locating technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. this is why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you will motivate these demonstrations to rethink new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">An especially secure machine as slide you want to become a flying lamp on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us is the salary in the development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It acts as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative and fun creatures to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential, is the door on the ridge.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">Almost 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very distant galaxy wandered in a very far away galaxy, they walked like the mass of three probes in a tenth of a pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they brightened brighter than all stars together in all the galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">They don't put your energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was handed in into space-time habitation, and exploded the universe in gravitational swells.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events in the first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Some 1.3 billion years ago was just a majority of life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has highlighted: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God arise at -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of Mueller - Rai Weiss was decided by the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- a huge laser detectors that are created for gravitational black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as a crazy genies, so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades, construction, design and extremely much harter work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometric gravitational observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of Ligo could be considerably increased, which improved its recognition rate tremendously.</seg>
<seg id="483">So you call it Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run by some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational swells of the two cocating black holes caused by the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my father's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">The fruits of my life had been in essence.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, wherever I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigated by gravitational swamps as Ligo measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a crusement in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By passing the shaft, the space and its contents are stretched into a direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, lecturer in courses for relative theory is often a real light of dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"expansions and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The issue is that Gravitational swells are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each one of us was stretched while performances of the waves and the elongation of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by one 1, the ligo staff stated for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length must be precisely measured on less than a thousandths of a nuclear core. this is Grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves follows: "the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are final and with the support of public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Return to Ligo. scott claims to see Ligo is more ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than the things around us: face, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. so you can make a picture or a map of things by talking about many points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with tones.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult to make a picture of things, which involve you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to specific properties like tape and height, rhythm and volume to close the story.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice speaks at Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational swells.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make any simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by changing the changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are within audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern in sound, we can listen to all the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity, too loud, can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes so that my colleague Scott tells me very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, p. pen simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same type of sound with an extra sound change. that's so on: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion, engraved in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that I must never forget -- heard Ligo Following: [Surrender of sound], knowing this as the sound of -- SH:... two black soldering of 30-fold sun, which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the brightest body in all, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 probes, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo pnet a whole new way to exploring the alls, as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can not see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserefacts are explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes are done in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through from there, since that opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational swamps penetrate iron, as it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the primorsky is covered by its own glow luminaires.</seg>
<seg id="541">By means of gravitational swells it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we will never see and of which we don't have to see. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found equal in the first approach, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars which observing black holes are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are tremendous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to add the sauerkraut for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo makes us a completely different view of view of events in space, on the emergence of stars and ultimately as we emerged from that chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and the pen of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observation activities -- a completely new generation of Observatory on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the urine of yourself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would like to say "Yes!" I was afraid of that I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it was nervous, I brought me in unpleasant situations I forgive me "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I like to start playing with the foam?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yeah, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared because I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="564">My anxiety linked to keep my social fear -- puff, path.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is awesome.</seg>
<seg id="566">"Yes" my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"Yes" I changed.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes which changed my life changed to an unexpectedly art. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for all "estimate", "</seg>
<seg id="570">For they would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"I don't need milk for my snorkation."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her to play if I could play with her when I was just on the leap. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I am swam to play with them as soon as you want to do with them. no matter what I'm doing, or whither I go, I say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am tired very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a blooming side effect: just before short, I actually understood that "Yes" -sakes to play my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things off, awake you for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Wonderful job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Wonderful job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I'm producing TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for taking over 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that previously not existed.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget of an TV channel episode can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode for all nine days four days, i.e. every nine days 20 million TV, four programmes, which are at the same time; 24 events: grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 Hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows a succession on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Throughout the world, my series are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV lessons are broadcasts, which I have created themselves, and not only produces time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans for bonfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, because I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Wonderful job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, when the word "author falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you, that all of you are working as hard if you speak a company, a country or a classroom, to learn it, that I am not only true to your computer, and it is true when I say: I understand that it's not going to dream with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deeper into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set troops, when I bet on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream you dream a high tone, a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, stressful, stressful, stily and mothering, clinically and motherly, cruel and sensible, and the best thing is to sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums hears like a busy road, and I could go on you.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take when I declare the sum, I think about it, that writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But when I began to work and work when I started to work and work, I began to work and work, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">It is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a sums, you can not strike your way.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, do not feel different, regardless of size, care for which price.</seg>
<seg id="624">It is called the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not for bariton, and I only know that I love the Sumums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want it to ask.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to be a clear: ever more transmisations, the more broadcasts, the more things more episodes, the more things are the same, the more things I watch, the more things I write off history, so more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more must work myself.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love this, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, sumums, sums, sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this Sumums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overdrawn, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy mom is a unique working range.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "Absolut, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of an TITANEN.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby TITANEN.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sum of the engine is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same TITANEN work, 15 hours-days, permanent weekends, no remoring not delegate, a titanium is not based on, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-up-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the Summa I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So, what does one do if you do, the work which you love, suddenly leave?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think, "Heul yourself, stupid of the author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you are doing how to be one teacher you do, one painter, a banker to be, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to feel the sum, when you knew the sums when the Summa stops, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song listen to my heart, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states Kelladress" represents me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm on the way outside, late and she says: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will tell you no more than two things to be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to all, and second, she called me not "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls no longer "estimate".</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I leave it when I am Titan bin and my sums betere, and here everything happens before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing is special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters push, we laugh a lot and I read altogether dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of sums, I can do nothing but watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists, sticky fingers and damn kisses, tender voices, crayons, and song, in which it endums go out, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something that dissolves in me.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy head comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sum, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with us.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the workmanship, the titanium dioxide, that is only the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, if I am saying, who am I, if I am talking about using broadcasts and TV stations and how working my brain, then I have forgotten what is the real sum.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not working.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">True sums is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">Sumums is the current, which comes from the life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real money is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real summits are ignored the pressure of history, which are related tasks, expectation and printing.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but maybe I persued to God the wrong words, for what God said to me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play in my way as working as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am always working because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, for what a man is better than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I know.</seg>
<seg id="728">Once more honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We grate around in the garden, before and back, go and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We have dashed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, abusing and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always agree to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children tell me how you live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! tell you yes when your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naiv, for a daytime.</seg>
<seg id="742">Well, you're right, but you can do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And why? you're not Rihanna or a Muppet show-figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child can be found less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they think they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit is replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speaks my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, am I Mother of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad-whale day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no deposit.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, finished children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drilled!</seg>
<seg id="757">My kids are my feeling of prosperity, my world. it does not have to be the children. it goes to feel the sums to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not going to play with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Leave the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what's doing good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it up.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in what I'm going about. I'll find books to read books, read the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got my first TV show when I wanted to make myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a copy, why do not treat full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door open up in and I find myself in my office. I have met me and my soul. I guess me to new ideas. I use it in full breasters and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sum, sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap Bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Sumums of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of labour is part of me, but just a part. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me, that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and play.</seg>
<seg id="780">But still, I have everything in control. my brain is still working. my bonfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the more I'm working.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums, the land that I run, the marathon, which I run, the armies, the sum, the sum, sums, the sum, the sums, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel like this sums, the more makes this unusual, imaging, naked and new feeling of life in me. less titanium - more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, that means to live its dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit drey.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and play more.</seg>
<seg id="793">TITANEN have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"will you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgical surgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after an accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-help.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a heavy injury of central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through different surgical techniques.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely it is one of the most well-known one, the "depth brain stimulation." there you implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to react to the control circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, who suffered severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading the doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain trauma-traumata has to imagine the brain and cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save the life, you have to reduce the skinscription.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this one has to remove a piece of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Rather than the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a slight task.</seg>
<seg id="821">The cells of a tissue should grow, is comparable to all small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You must find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive on them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many looking, it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">That he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a master cell culture. with great green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know that stem cells are unripe cells, that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells out of the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We had a further fascinating observation: normal regular cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells refer to a different manner.</seg>
<seg id="835">They dipped themselves gradually and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell numbers that looked like stem cells but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral sequences.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the separation of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near the brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our regular cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source, which allows the healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brains from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then, then marked in color, to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we rode it in the centre of the same individuals.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimply these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reimplate the same cells in your brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we broke out the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were back home after some weeks, they would have been taken back home. they're not needed there, so they will disappear there.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a injury and rectifouted exactly the same cells and now, the cells remained -- it increased neurons to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show, are these little points. these are the cells that we in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells help a monkey to recover from one brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable creature level, we ultimately had the motorized cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hands anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen for people, they improved spontaneously up to some degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to fetch it with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover themselves at some degree as the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey who was spontaneous.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not that precise, and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we roasted the cells: the same monkey, two months after implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for instance with Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to immobilize them while people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain has the resources to cure himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure to think several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know anyone who can use."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course the question, which are the biggest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting with this great results you need to complete about two kilograms papers and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is clear, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and almost a professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to have permission to start clinical trials. if you want to look into the future as many years it will take until someone can come into hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already takes a long time to choose the patients to make treatment and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicore study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before we can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is sure of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting with TED and that you told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the west make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy as the breakable plant which is in reality, but as Inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider her as a change to change.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his huge descendants in Beijing have no doubt that it is possible to have a blooming capitalist and impressive growth while the policy is totally undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy disappears with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I realized Greece - the newly elected Greek government - was unequivocal to me that the democratic process of our country -- Our elections -- Our elections -- not the austerity that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my excited friends, which would say to me if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I pray you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a Irrbelieve, we could save us democracy, but that we need a truthful and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are wasted, our future, and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I want to point you at an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our activity.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognise him as the Schuldenberg which throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belong to the unused austerity and corporations, to invest it there might be productive and incomes, which one could produce it and also all the things could produce, for example "green" energy. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 billion dollars were invested in the U.S., in England and in the Eurozone, such as industrial plants, machinery, office building, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 Billions US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compares the same time to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutes, and absolutely nothing did, except the exchanges to blame and upward the property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit that is not the same due to the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="925">The circumstances lead to the circumstances occurring that economist lets him kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadage with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely high-productive capital should be used to enhance our lives, human talents and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is the democracy change?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we continue: what do we understand for democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, in which the city and the poor as a majority of the government control.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy grew up too many, of course --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the ancies of the Athenian democracy because of these statements.</seg>
<seg id="934">The making of the Athenian democracy was and is that she was not only the right to employment a free speech, but important and decisive is that they had the right to political participation with equal voice-weighting in issues of state governments.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy was not kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also rapidly burnt.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracy have not their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy grew more concentrated on the free citizens, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for mistress.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only visible when a complete separation of politics and economy possible and the democratic process was bordered by politics, while the economy is the world of the concert - a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present-time democracies have been found since the time in which this separation of politics and economy began to pursue an inexable struggle between the two, as the economy gradually emigrated to politics and disposed them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you admire why the politicians are not the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It lies not at a Degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadmen with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in approximately as such a flock of cradles, which is so sustainably the animals of which they are nourished, decimated that they were starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that the politics discontinued as far as the power of the corporations itself. the power of corporations is growing, political confessions will grow and the managing director of the corporations are to be anxious to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">According to capitalist capitalism, the "demos" [the people] expelled, the higher are the twin summit, and so is greater the waste of human labor power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it is obvious that we must return to politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" deeds, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea just 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debit of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only be recovered by a miracle in ancient Athens, without creating new kinds of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing by low cost-construction employees through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long business and policy of separate areas, the automation can be higher, the waste of the twin ones, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must transform the economy and assign the fields of economy and politics again, and we assess the reunified area hyperautocracy which leaves the film "matrix" like a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not, whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that it has produced, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The interesting question is whether capitalism is rescashed by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix", or by something that the company shall serve the human being in the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient athlete "Agora," in long conversations of the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" like Utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: Ask a capital market before you works, while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">All income comes from capital and income, and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction more between those who belong to the company, but workers that work there are not owned there, but the company does not belong to them, but no large gaps between investment and chips, and ultimately no empt twin rounds.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies would have a free changing exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 biggest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we call it" the cosmos "in units of" Kosmos "'-- and every government pay the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant of the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green "technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed to the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we, especially in front of the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe it is the same time the secretary, in which she privileged people prefer, and marxist, because they are buried in the separation of capital and work in the garbage can of history, and keynesianisch, globally keynesianisch.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we could imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we sinking in a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to politically decide.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do better even democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How does Marx'Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and business... do not doing this, the technological development will create a massive decrease in macroeconomic demand as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transmission of this crisis a part of Earth is to the next as we can see it is not only our democracies to destabilize, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are there.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clear what you think of the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the approve of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have spent democracy in politics, during the area where most of the economy is playing, -- the area of the economy -- a completely corporate-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I may say the provocative, China resembles today the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect to liberalism and democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">It was especially skeptical that affects the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now preferable to do what the West has done themselves in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I wonder that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: Yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal viewpoint, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make the Eurozone with a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, the complacency was to say goodbye, and persevering suspicion, that proceeded by the euro zone, and continues to massively attract the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek incense -- by the way, the first suggestion which revealed this understanding --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Right to do. unfortunately, the powers in the eurozone, within the eurozone, continues to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system which is unable to gain political will and authoritism to life, it might be a while, but if the change occurs, he happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you ahead of?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone, who looks back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or some minister, who claimed after 6 months in office, in particular in an so-called situation, he didn't have made mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest defect was to sign the application for extending the extension programme to the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of monetary effect to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted to bring only our government, only because they didn't want to deal with confections that were left through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't know that it had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">Nobody from the Troika of money, who encouraged us this policy, and a: "that was a kolossaler mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all these, and despite the aggressive rush of conversations, you seem to be quite a European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from somebody who lives in Europe and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Because when they are not alive, the supervised flickering will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not alone have catastrophic consequences alone, but for the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we plead ourselves to reject the way of a postmodern 1930 that it appears, it will also be the best for Europeans's future as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you lie in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most of Roy Price still has never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That's going back to the decision, the Roy arrived three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive staff at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has a Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as "Films, TV, Technique, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for the shows and the content, which is going to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard fought sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy does not choose anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows which are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the web site. the rating goes from 1 to 10 a.m. and the height shows how many shows will get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Will be valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "" "" "" game of Thrones, "" "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addicted, where to ask for a season, your brain asks, "Where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This sort of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows are like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not answer him to the left side of the curve, because I think you have already had special intelligence to teach "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on the mean exploitation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon was doing something, therefore Roy Price doesn't want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to draw successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He requires guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses by an analysis of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of this shows where they can watch them online.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon find out free things, you're going to do right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are watching the shows of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They will be watched by Roy and his team that record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They capture when you start the show when one pauses that parts one jumps. look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data then to produce which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect data, process this and hence the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom for four republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because they were not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- when the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House reached 7.5 -- so something above the average, but not exactly the inscription of Roy and his team worked out.</seg>
<seg id="1073">For about the same time in another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming from Netflix. exactly like Roy is he always in search for this a super show and it is also used data for it but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team looked to the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so reviews they give the shows that they like to like them etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find these little details about the spectators: what shows they like what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a venture, and decided to make a Sitcom for four senators, but a drama series about an Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has suffered a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so that's exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data recorded companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine this many data together and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic had somehow been said that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one has collected millions of data for a decision which one meets, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can optimise it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The Mindeste, what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, then this is a bit scary because we can grab more and more in time to make serious choices far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone knows here the Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health System is a software company and I hope that no one comes into touch with this software. come in contact with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If any one is in prison in the USA and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is being used to determine if a dismissal is or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, if one person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Sorry, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. this is not the case that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data-to-evaluate firms are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does sometimes cause mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google known that they can predict through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worse way -- through data analysis of Google services.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year round, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">The data to intercate firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors the data flows into account a -- at the workplace, in the process of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I am working on the computer-based genetics -- a field, with some very smart people unimaginable to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. I have noticed some samples on the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be common.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Have you ever resolve a complex problem, do you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">When designing this problem in his individual parts, so that you can analyse the single parts; as a second place you put the items together to capture a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and back together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help you destroy a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suited to put the parts back and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something that is good for the brain, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete to summarize a good discourse -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and mind, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to get their audience better, what else would have not been able to get all these parts, and it will return to a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they went a very personal risk of this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong ways.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to take all their decisions first, when they squeezed TV ideas as they chose "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It didn't lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions but I think things are wrong, when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was written, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-Question you just have to shake the ball for a response. "highly probably" -- this moment is this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will join it later with a demo demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in hindsight into the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you don't know if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much more extracted, like data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So, perhaps the ball bounds and sounding. ultimately it is coming to us to make decisions when we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that it is still paying off, despite the great quantity of data, making decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For by the end there are not the data, but the risks, with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
