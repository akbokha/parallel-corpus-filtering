Munich 1856 : four maps that change your glance into the city
one Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt , where young people will meet .
a sal@@ ary chapel , where now is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tun@@ n@@ els .
small gar@@ den@@ ers enter@@ tains the simple reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich convey@@ s exciting stories to days .
it is ner@@ vous when maps are not current .
this knows everyone , who had to go up again because the Nav@@ i Auto Nav@@ i took part in a green me@@ adow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , a quot@@ ation of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - but just so very informative .
particularly if you compare it with current online cards .
during the 19th century , the cities and municip@@ alities of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur will be changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a Flick@@ r family , which one is not recogn@@ iz@@ able as such .
in the great review card , maps and municip@@ alities were presented in detail for towns and municip@@ alities .
this origin@@ ated according to the Bavarian inv@@ iting period between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement in Bay@@ ern@@ s .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Co@@ alition War with Austria .
Napoleon wish to wish an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topo@@ graphic recording of Bay@@ ern@@ s on behalf of - of course to military purposes .
even when the French troops t@@ ended with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 1801 , the present @-@ day neigh@@ b@@ ors who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria ticket .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project to the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thereby the Bavarian publishing experience .
the foundation sheet for Munich is from the year 1856 and is as far as all other on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of the country &apos;s capital is an impressive example of today &apos;s capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
ship@@ ling was built 21 years after the map , including the Munich district .
today sub@@ mission is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub@@ si@@ lings to be named in 1856 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian pe@@ as@@ ants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , you see nothing fields - at first glance : at the Hin@@ rich@@ ly there is a small part of duplic@@ ation lines and figures : hand@@ writing numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ anium . &quot; from which the property tax was deduc@@ ted .
small plots reve@@ al no more rural estate today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of sub@@ mer@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 venue of the Ok@@ tober@@ fest , was in the 19th century , actually a me@@ adow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an in@@ sight into the history of psych@@ iat@@ ric Medicine .
in the prototype row , in the area of today Au @-@ Ha@@ id@@ hausen , you read only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ e@@ ig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the fans &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
Yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ field road you could bar@@ rier people with mad@@ ness .
there was 1858 / 59 the Munich district of Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt recorded &quot; On the Au@@ er fans . &quot;
in 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gud@@ run the dec@@ or - that psych@@ iat@@ rist , which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced to his time and ended for example the qu@@ ettes of the so @-@ called Irish .
he also has instru@@ cted the staff to apply violence against the ins@@ ur@@ ances , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Director of the Museum Ha@@ id@@ hausen , who has employed for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first place was first , later on 500 places expanded .
some@@ time there was no longer a capacity so far - the reason for the construction of the cir@@ u@@ ren@@ dering plant in hair 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ AMP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ East Germany is one of Germany &apos;s largest psych@@ iat@@ ry .
ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents are now based on the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order issued the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth @-@ home with voc@@ ational training .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; was built in an architectural re@@ jection of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &apos;s origin , which was destroyed by bom@@ bing in World War II .
the Marien@@ platz was listed in 1856 as a &quot; main square &quot; listed , the department was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the second world war broke the second world war in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies had many holes in the city centre in December of 1944 .
a great remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , Small Business H@@ alls and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marien@@ hof , where the days going to work and on 5 April 2017 the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich @-@ map with the picture of today - and the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
civil Law publ@@ ishes travel warning for Miss@@ ouri
National Association for the promotion of colour states has shown a warning for colored people who travel to the dis@@ cri@@ mination of politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the State to Miss@@ ouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Ad@@ visory authority shall apply to the State of Miss@@ ouri , who encour@@ age customers and Miss@@ our@@ i@@ aner , on travel through the State of particular attention , as a number of frag@@ ments , r@@ ass@@ en@@ based acc@@ idents in the entire state may be noted and here , &quot; says it &apos;s in the statement of the group .
a recently approved law of Miss@@ ouri , which makes people he@@ avier , dis@@ cri@@ mination complaints , and the prosec@@ ution of the state , which causes dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate to min@@ or@@ ities as well as the group of travel bud@@ dies , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; you have passed viol@@ ations of civil rights to happen .
they are faced because of their skin colour , they are sm@@ itten or killed , &quot; said the President of Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kan@@ sas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency , which we don &apos;t have heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that issued the organization for a state in the USA .
the group trem@@ bled such as a rac@@ ist viol@@ ation against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under a question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline on the journey through the State nor granted by the police of Miss@@ ouri , without a crime fiction some@@ time .
the Council has also been shown on a recent report by Miss@@ ouri Office , which is shown that black motor@@ ists will be more likely to be more common in the State of 75 percent more common .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their friends and their families , friends and staff who could happen in Miss@@ ouri . &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be ready to bring it to the country , or let their relatives know that they are travelling through the state . &quot;
Miss@@ ouri reported 100 hearing crimes , based on the latest figures from the F@@ BI , the State of such in@@ jur@@ ies to the number of such in@@ jur@@ ies to the 16th place of the country .
travel warning is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri law that would make it more difficult to compl@@ ain a company because of living or employment dis@@ cri@@ mination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) had adopted amend@@ ments for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immig@@ ration shall be oblig@@ atory to negoti@@ ate people because of mig@@ rant viol@@ ations , which will contri@@ bute to the view of the AC@@ LU for further ri@@ ass@@ ing profiles .
travel warning will usually be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries but in the l@@ ately they have employed the measure in response to certain laws and trends in the USA .
past@@ ure @-@ aun@@ ching project is elem@@ ent@@ ar
the F@@ ishing bacher We@@ ide@@ z@@ aun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ s@@ im@@ pu@@ ties Peter White and Cord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have obtained a picture on the spot .
in the right @-@ excav@@ ation of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fisher@@ y CD@@ U @-@ city group met together with may@@ or Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted in@@ sights into his farm where it houses 55 hectares of me@@ adows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy c@@ ows , as well as many k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five residential apartments .
the &quot; Black sk@@ imm@@ ed milk &quot; is for him the alternative sel@@ ector path for the milk of his c@@ ows , so piv@@ oting .
the table of the holiday guests is only Regional .
since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of F@@ ishing bach , he hon@@ ored the we@@ ide@@ z@@ ren project as &quot; elem@@ ent@@ ar . &quot;
I can &apos;t be profitable on such areas .
the farm gr@@ abs for much work , much co@@ usions can be processed using the sense of the sense .
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and the topo@@ graphy , &quot; emphas@@ ized Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not perform bio @-@ operation .
for may@@ or Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the meaning of the ide@@ z@@ aun@@ ts and is del@@ ighted with the leader @-@ funding . &quot;
for 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
we hope that this st@@ ills of the areas could go beyond a whole while .
&quot; the greatest treasure which we have , are the people who work in agriculture and thought about it , &quot; st@@ ressed the may@@ or . &quot;
farmers are often standing in cr@@ iti@@ que because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 via the We@@ ide@@ z@@ ren promotion .
the closure of the area is 40 hectares that cannot be opened until at least 2023 .
in the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the current cost was promoted , a quarter carried out by the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
as a result , farmers remained in the farmers 12 610 euros , and they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
Cord@@ ula Kov@@ ac st@@ ressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job , no farmers and farmers do not work . &quot;
even for Peter White stood firm@@ ly : &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot;
the landscape profiles ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ support of f@@ ences .
the purpose is to keep the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR feature is al@@ tered .
in addition , non @-@ t@@ anning area should not be per@@ sever@@ ably managed ( slope over 35 per cent ) and must thus be threat@@ ened by the so@@ lic@@ ation .
for the F@@ ishing bacher We@@ ide@@ z@@ ren project , the deadline exp@@ ires eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres .
the closure area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes off the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ ack@@ le the stat@@ ues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as every other - therefore the well @-@ directed down@@ fall S@@ add@@ am Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olog@@ ists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ reg@@ imes , knew what he did , when he took a symbo@@ lic au@@ li@@ cally with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the suggest@@ ions of the legal dis@@ pute with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ unding owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators had caught him if it had done it .
but he grab@@ bed of their importance , and in particular the importance of which you are attributed to as the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta dec@@ im@@ ped : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that sh@@ ines the world .
the po@@ em , refer@@ ring to you , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively real , but as he himself form@@ ulated it , it is not really about history .
it comes to a trem@@ end@@ ous response to the sh@@ immer@@ ing words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only enter any old immig@@ rants , but the poor crow@@ ds that acc@@ id@@ ate themselves to bre@@ a@@ the , and the poor waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ event@@ h waste &quot; was better on our screens .
Miller did not eng@@ age in liter@@ ary critic@@ ism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps .
this conflict regarding the meaning of a statue is a part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who had decided to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that they complete a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and Americ@@ an@@ ical re@@ publi@@ can , representing the female em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its po@@ em is the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she himself is a quite different name : mother of the ex@@ ile .
the connection of the ge@@ di@@ ch@@ ism with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a dev@@ ast@@ ating attack on the American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus did the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change their wings from the right wing this long ago .
the great writer Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming from Tr@@ ump , ar@@ gu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is easy to bring the American flame into the recovered world : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing .
it aims to bear the tor@@ ch of Freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the F@@ ack@@ el should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here to be something .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of the per@@ c@@ eption of the per@@ c@@ eption .
the great phant@@ astic de@@ ed of Lazarus was found to see them as they were seen from the cre@@ sted , but ho@@ p@@ eless people looking after long and often aw@@ ful trips on the deck@@ s of ships .
it &apos;s the true sense that the world is looking for people from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever would like to recognize .
their tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but the hat@@ red that is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Ne@@ il Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK teams
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle remember@@ ed a time when only two sh@@ all@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Ne@@ il Black , says the 16 @-@ member Scottish Con@@ t@@ ing@@ ent in the world championship team &quot; aff@@ ord a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that in Scotland was a special project &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand , and we will continue to find out what we &apos;ll need to find out , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I speak with people at the Scottish instit@@ utes of sport and think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ets think that it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ets are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ are - who were able to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen from the team as team captain .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite mod@@ est .
their capit@@ ol speech was incredibly , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scotland or wher@@ ever they were , or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling , the rush of naturally include , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , which will compete for their fifth world championships with 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 sho@@ ots in the British team are .
currently the best Total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which was reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the down@@ stream Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5.000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another car@@ rot that was supposed to observe the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remember@@ ed their first world championships as the only other Sch@@ otte in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team capitalism says that they are &quot; enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly proud &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and during the fin@@ als .
&quot; it is so special about the team capitalism , that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ates have chosen for me and make me something special for me , &quot; added them .
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all the sho@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we come .
and they are concerned here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes w@@ anting to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what my speech as a capital concerns ?
Yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go and compete , and it just will be such a great atmosphere . &quot;
block from crit@@ ics on Facebook : do not manage to ban a public office if you do not toler@@ ate the inc@@ lin@@ ation of vot@@ ers
the Father of our land knew something of bad media .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of all the internal policy until his political principles .
he shr@@ ink with the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not have his crit@@ ics in silence .
for the year 1783 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of freedom can be removed - and dum@@ b and m@@ ute we become as sheep to batt@@ les . &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Govern@@ or Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , which has to work for more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this week because of this week .
the rod of the governor , dis@@ missed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ , and the online commentary was full of a counter@@ campaign with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it &apos;s a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is an Republi@@ can governor in an over@@ whel@@ ming democratic state that is am@@ az@@ ingly popular .
he has the ep@@ ith@@ el@@ ial consent of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the Nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ip@@ ed to use Facebook as pri@@ st@@ worthy means to dis@@ playing with his vot@@ ers and supporting his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ ade of persons that comes to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is designated as officially and by employees who are paid in public tax dollars - un@@ necessary and ultim@@ ately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans Spre@@ ader in Am@@ elia ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the governor and argue that blo@@ cking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of TRO@@ LL@@ EN or air @-@ filled people who sc@@ roll the wh@@ ip online .
the post talked with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a entre@@ pren@@ eur , and a priest , no trol@@ ls .
they all said that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , thoug@@ ht@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bow@@ ie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ itting , but she asked for an crime scene .
&quot; I comm@@ ented , that I was dis@@ appointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ ler and other current news , &quot; wrote it in the news area of the news post@@ ing &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I gu@@ ess this idea , even if a number of people will be on the same subject , they will be dis@@ regarded as such as a benef@@ icial collective duty and not recognized as a large group of citizens . &quot;
as the employees of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated sp@@ am attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; Princip@@ ality . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cutting a message by simply blocked a cr@@ itic or delete a negative comment .
it is much more precise than in ear@@ liest days if you have been dis@@ pat@@ ched that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical ed@@ itor@@ ials and demonstr@@ ate demonstr@@ ators , or demonstr@@ ate demonstr@@ ators .
but exactly that happens now .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public offici@@ als which critic@@ ises that he has vacc@@ inated Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ing by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County b@@ last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , as it was an elec@@ torate from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ LU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect like the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 ; and anonymous letter signals struck their leadership .
and even then Washington an@@ ony@@ me tro@@ phy .
the people who were p@@ seu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ er@@ ius &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; used all the letters to newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions made .
in particular , pet@@ itions which critic@@ ises its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping of the United Kingdom with UK critic@@ ised his dom@@ inion , according to historical documents , which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not have her to silence .
freedom of expression and dis@@ course belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty ho@@ pes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European Union No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is ho@@ ping for the next three days at home , since the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who performed in Arch@@ er@@ field Links up to the final round , before he lost to the new venue and acts as a tournament amb@@ assador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieves his f@@ ame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ a@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great state .
Jerry has made a great job when he set this place .
he is an e@@ ager suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship in the first time , although he has won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; it really feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura to defend it in the year after I had gained it from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year .
it was a really special time and one that we will appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came on his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior Tour , returns to the action on h@@ omet@@ own .
this event will be his first Scottish gig since the Aber@@ de@@ en As@@ set Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you will feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf course .
I &apos;m glad as it has gone . &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Vo@@ os@@ n@@ am and Senior Major champ@@ ions Paul broad@@ casts , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sho@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proce@@ eds are at Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less getting kid@@ ney caused by pas@@ siv@@ ity
in the past two decades , less humans have always died because of pas@@ siv@@ ity on the lung cancer .
at this end , scientists attended the university hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , we carry out 167 lung car@@ cases on passive smoking per year , &quot; said study He@@ iko M@@ ug .
as a comparison , he moved to his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time 400 treatment of lung acc@@ idents were given due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
hom@@ an@@ connections are proved very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing , and they are reason@@ ably more in time , &quot; so the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the field of conc@@ eption the location is more complicated than alleg@@ ed , since the underground is not noticed in the plans .
the traffic , which is still obst@@ ru@@ cted in construction , is a big issue for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of motor@@ ists in front of red lights and bar@@ riers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the bus bus@@ se may be entitled to passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z at the company St@@ ump@@ p are busy working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were pretty exhau@@ sting .
but lu@@ ck@@ ily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; said Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and Death in the Indones@@ ian Gol@@ dland
if B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , they do not use a stove .
they even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regime in the un@@ quiet Indian province of Pap@@ ua , the hous@@ ew@@ ife is normally located a sweet potato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - right into the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the short@@ ened kne@@ e is removed with e@@ ager@@ ly , un@@ washed hands and sw@@ allowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she leads her daily work , e.g. clothes with tr@@ unk@@ y water from nearby s@@ ump .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room is available as a lat@@ rine .
as a youngest of the four wives of their man , their fields were not al@@ located .

&quot; no one claims to go down after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare in@@ sight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony in Indonesia , which was born in 1969 after a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.@@ 26 elders had to vote against the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement which res@@ ur@@ red for independence against the du@@ tch dom@@ inion , turned back to the government of Jak@@ arta who maint@@ ains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was divided officially in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of the island of Pap@@ ua New Guinea .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is such a location as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province Capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then another 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there are no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo cabins , and from the shaft roof@@ s which have been converted by rust in different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ian have made their journey here , mo@@ uring journalists and prac@@ tically no fore@@ ign@@ ers .

&quot; we only had leaves to our physi@@ ks . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest country where 28 % of men are living below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indones@@ ian Gol@@ dland .
the largest and most benef@@ ici@@ est golden mine of the world , Grass berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a floo@@ ding in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was dis@@ mant@@ led of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of the mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua that saf@@ egu@@ arding Indonesia &apos;s powerful military .
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel was paid between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ vian amounts due to greater autonom@@ y threat@@ ens these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activ@@ ists , more than 500.000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military , tort@@ ured and im@@ pris@@ oned .
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s ancest@@ ral land in the 1970 &quot; s were committed to the genocide of the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .

&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ Explorer for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development , since Muslim &apos;s economy has changed , as the Muslim &apos;s population , Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

&quot; the mig@@ rants are started to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains Ab@@ eth You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai in@@ native to the provinc@@ ial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .

the Indones@@ ian President of J@@ oko Wid@@ odo , popul@@ arly known as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , promised the in@@ equ@@ alities and legal viol@@ ations in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann held 27 of the total 29 distri@@ cts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pre@@ sidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and nowadays the loc@@ als feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will ful@@ fil our ho@@ pes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai under@@ went a grav@@ ure for two months after J@@ ok@@ ov@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 , there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs before a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
they told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers faced up the sound and later returned with four soldiers , the local past@@ or of Pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , they pursued and beat the group with their gun , they had sacrif@@ ices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers allegedly fired in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Ye@@ imo , was so difficult to hit the com@@ a .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Commander of Justice to call justice .
they carried out cerem@@ on@@ ial inf@@ ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bir@@ d@@ ag@@ ang im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators started to mu@@ end stones at police and military posts .
when the audience was heated , the soldiers was sent to an internal radio : &quot; if the mass@@ es put more than three times , they make it dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME , which was not released in local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ four of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the thre@@ at risk and called for rest and called for the amount to return home .
no one was to be heard in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around myself , I was shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIME on the ver@@ anda of his colorful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame don &apos;t know who mo@@ ist , but he says that the ball came out of the ranks of the ranks here .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many con@@ uts were fired . &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his co@@ us@@ in , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; I ran@@ ged to him , and exam@@ ine his body to go certain that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , and how many Indones@@ ian remember only one name , the TIME in a dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I took him k@@ iss@@ ed . &quot;
the head spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende said re@@ por@@ ous that his officers want only &quot; secure &quot; because they might be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threat@@ ening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Com@@ mission@@ er Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were in@@ ju@@ red .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings arrived at the following day &apos; filtered off &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i held a pas@@ sion@@ ate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura for families of the victims of the victims of the victims .
&quot; I would like that this case will immediately be solved , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he had an extra@@ ju@@ di@@ cial mechanism to inter@@ act historical human rights viol@@ ations .
but the spe@@ e@@ ches began almost immediately .
&quot; most in@@ jur@@ ies have occurred long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we are obliged to move forward to these viol@@ ations , but there are processes that have to go through , &quot; he said .
then , Esper@@ anto made a withdrawal when he spoke in Jak@@ arta in Jak@@ arta before TIME and said , he had no plans to create a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , whom the UNO was indicted for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights viol@@ ations in Pap@@ ua had already been resol@@ ved , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai inc@@ ident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such alleg@@ ations with integrated dis@@ belie@@ vers .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I have fear of being arrested by the military , fear f@@ righ@@ tened . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in pan@@ i@@ ai was afraid to discuss the inc@@ ident .
he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the army searched for me , &quot; he says .
the sh@@ ades have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police occupied the village Resid@@ ences in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of De@@ iy@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , died one person and 17 others were in@@ ju@@ red , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was dro@@ w@@ ned in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
village Resid@@ ents prot@@ est@@ ished in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers came on officers , re@@ acted by their warning .
but native people that the mobile Brigade ( Indones@@ ian police ) had to shoot on the amount and killed one killed .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ ven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the n@@ urse walking distance and witness , as the last here is quickly installed , so the TIME .
&quot; I hid two days in my house . &quot;
the De@@ iy@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the officers to the account and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an inv@@ ent@@ ative for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strength@@ ens the un@@ satis@@ faction of the Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many decided to defend the Free Pap@@ ua motion &quot; ( O@@ PM ) to defend the bel Army , claim@@ ing to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua as imp@@ lic@@ ate spor@@ adi@@ c attacks by the Indian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leader comes from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ oya .
as a reaction , thousands of people were arrested in the last few years and was arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of the national so@@ vere@@ ign@@ ty . &quot;
some are never up again .
among humans in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a trag@@ ic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthen the un@@ satis@@ faction .
the little Reis , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is to be expensive for loc@@ als .
the bread is exactly out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they re@@ tain much of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian Rup@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic in@@ equ@@ alities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new mig@@ rants has grown since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire in larger numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually better educ@@ ated and pro@@ sp@@ erous their mig@@ rants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary cap@@ abilities to lead their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in keeping in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation continues the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , limit@@ ations of the reporting international media remain b@@ anned .
at the beginning of the year the French journalists from Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ champ were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they gave the rare permission to the films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ov@@ is election campaign have been resol@@ ved to re@@ medy transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new dang@@ ers for foreign journalists who try out of Indonesia &apos;s un@@ du@@ ous provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua more : Visa Electron and a black list , &quot; he said in a declaration .
lack of press control means that the international pressure remains restricted to Indones@@ ian government to the immediate neigh@@ b@@ ors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ onga , N@@ aur@@ u , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ones Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; different and widespread in@@ jur@@ ies &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have been histor@@ ically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a Nas@@ ir showed the pre@@ di@@ aries of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is no media so that it is difficult to destroy the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people are planning to inform that more foreign governments are aware of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human rights @-@ amb@@ assador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura went on , 4th May , broke their silence and ur@@ ged him &quot; We want liber@@ ty , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but anonymous would remain anonymous .
Indonesia received another pre@@ sidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably not co@@ inc@@ ide to J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but it is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai ha@@ zel@@ nuts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the board .
he wants that J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that it is under the permanent thre@@ at of a r@@ umin@@ ous military , is located in a poor education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have a &quot; gu@@ ilt , &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they don &apos;t want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ jur@@ ies , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sho@@ ck offered a last symbo@@ lic act of the Trot@@ sky@@ ist : the cor@@ pse of a vic@@ tim was buried on a site opposite the police and the military station .
they may never know that they may never forget justice but at least they don &apos;t forget their respon@@ si@@ bilities .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire to capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai to the second time
a fire found on Friday in one of the highest residence towers of the world in Dubai , its world @-@ book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 m high , 79 story building .
it is the second brand , which is exc@@ ited through the hig@@ hr@@ ise building in just two years , called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ le Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , in@@ jur@@ ies were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we are standing at the fire alarm and in the cry of the people .
we ran@@ ged into the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to come , &quot; told the inhabitants of his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of the fire @-@ fighting against 4.00 PM local time ( 00@@ .00 hrs . GMT ) fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the building cool down .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodation for those affected .
the inc@@ ident can have questions concerning the safety of materials that are used in outdoor halls of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch Building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of damages is covered by the cl@@ adding , the outdoor cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said , they believe that the system of panels for the insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ ade tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire , with about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with the major Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the Davis Cup single was only supported on two races , w@@ afer @-@ thin not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , there is also a valu@@ ed five set classi@@ cs to stay the tradition@@ ally apply .
with 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the target of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ el@@ ty therefore became missing .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are dis@@ appointed that our members don &apos;t have the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
one will continue to work to improve the application .
not just as a vote was , after a lot of plans , the final decision was able to apply the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 will only be compar@@ atively smaller details : so fin@@ alists will be found at the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organ@@ izers , the requirements on training places , etc . , the player will have to complete the Davis Cup fewer official media dates .
more than 1 of 5 US travel@@ ers brings b@@ idden objects into the plane , finds out a survey
a survey among air@@ lines revealed that more than 20 percent be aware of deli@@ ber@@ ately prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , while they acc@@ ident@@ ally carried out the plane or other objects with clin@@ ch .
less than 1 per cent said they would have discovered that they have made ir@@ rt@@ ed@@ ly with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explosive .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter @-@ service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also certain that younger trav@@ ellers were concerned about the rules .
of those question@@ ed , en@@ cores having not actually tried to fly with something that was forbidden by T@@ SA , was 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enn@@ ials , compared with less than 15 percent , who were members of Generation X were .
the most common items that were deli@@ ber@@ ately referred to T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent , all items with clin@@ ches caused by the security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ d@@ ents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ d@@ ents also confirm that they had applied deli@@ ber@@ ately prohibited Dr@@ ugs in the Air@@ plane .
the company said it was asking for travel@@ ers throughout the country to find out how many acc@@ ident@@ ally sm@@ ug@@ ged dirt were brought by the airport security and how many had done it .
it is not a surprise that people who are most likely to be sm@@ ug@@ ged - acc@@ ident@@ ally or un@@ kn@@ ow@@ ingly - by security , those who were most often flying .
however , the company pro@@ ves that the T@@ SA rules have a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are un@@ certain that fluids they may take or as much of it .
so , no surprise is that the largest quantity of liquids purchased by T@@ SA are forbidden .
for a time , the people thought T@@ SA could be books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not matter : tens of thousands of Tesla cancel order order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k visits the huge number of pre@@ ferences for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far he has learned that a part of the customer has with@@ drawn their binding reservation again .
in addition to the always tri@@ umph@@ al numbers compared to sales figures , Tesla @-@ Boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has reported for the first time another number of poor figures for the first time results : the cancell@@ ations made a new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently entered the new car with more than 500.000 provisions for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
Mus@@ k cle@@ ared this : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 provisions , 63@@ .000 have already been with@@ drawn .
crit@@ ics had always pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla paid the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 dollar and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Offer request &quot; is fully returned .
currently , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , Mus@@ k cle@@ ared in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
however , the cancellation of so far only twelve percent of all orders to be solved , however , the Tesla Boss is not believed .
its argument : the challenge to the ambitious aims of growth is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year , Tesla produced 84@@ .000 cars .
2018 - all models have to be combined - 500@@ ,000 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , reservations are currently per day 1800 reservations .
who can be ordered today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; may be expected at the ear@@ liest in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tesla then creates his brand new , never even in practice proven production roads without bigger breaks .
many experts des@@ pair that this is possible .
but if it comes to bigger del@@ ays , then the in@@ scription of reservations for Tesla could become Tesla .
because then the company can &apos;t fail to avoid un@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ hr pul@@ ls up because of the re@@ charge of the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he was su@@ ing from 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of environmental protection authority , began to delay the implementation of the Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the shift in when his Agency proved to meet the needs of the state of environmental authorities as the previous wo@@ unds .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous point in a Federal Labour Court .
it comes to a time@@ out which ran on 1 October for states to keep the standards of ground in the middle of 2015 .
in June , he announced the ad@@ her@@ ence to a year to spend a year in order to study the plan to study the plan and to avoid eating itself in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent str@@ en@@ tive environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeat@@ edly dropped to block or ren@@ ounce to ren@@ ounce its chemical industry and industry of fossil fu@@ els .
the sud@@ den turn of the Wednesday is the latest legal back@@ lash for the re@@ organisation of regul@@ atory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Justice in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ ste@@ ward has exceeded his authority as he tried to aband@@ on the implementation of a Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane le@@ cks .
in one on Wednesday evening &apos;s statement , P@@ ru@@ dence proposed that his K@@ ehr@@ tw@@ ard in o@@ zone standard simply beat the will@@ ing@@ ness of EPA to cooperation with States by the complex process of tim@@ ely ful@@ fil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; under earlier wo@@ unds , EPA have often stopped the dead@@ lines for performing and then waiting for the execution of activ@@ ists and others , said P@@ ru@@ itt , who dis@@ band@@ ed the EPA more than a do@@ zen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in regulation of jurisdiction and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
we also accept the law and authority who gives us serious . &quot;
nevertheless , the statement of the EPA , that P@@ ru@@ suffered had to use his &quot; power against delay and all other leg@@ ally available , to ensure that the rules &quot; based on a solid policy and best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
one in the last month of approved legislation , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric T@@ ail@@ man , who commanded the co@@ alition of the States that compl@@ ained the EPA in that week , the Group int@@ ends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; the revers@@ ing of EPA - after our h@@ unt - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6,7 million New York and the over 115 million Americans that are affected directly from the smo@@ g , which flows into their churches , &quot; said Schne@@ ider@@ man .

representatives of public health care and environmental prot@@ ector celebrated over P@@ ru@@ pts of a surprising course change .
&quot; it is wor@@ ried as much pressure needs to get this reasonable step by the respon@@ si@@ bilities for the protection of the air that we in@@ hal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .

Verein aims to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim moves &quot; and does not see legal status for the building and is therefore addressed to the coun@@ sel@@ or .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim moves &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , approved its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
they be bl@@ am@@ aged .
the club ar@@ gu@@ ed that at the time of permission , on 30 December 2016 , at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette has no wind turbines have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there is only a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible , but the concentration zone causes a excl@@ usion of wind energy use for the rest of town .
the firm zones are to prevent a &quot; spar@@ kl@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a few days earlier through a change in the amount of space plan in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but the District government Düsseldorf was not approved , because of a form was lack@@ ing .
&quot; by the lack of planning legal ent@@ ity , the granted approval decision is to be accepted as far as before , &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k@@ ens , &quot; Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the current state of things : the city represented once again before the summer break in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a approval of the district government is still ongoing .
Er@@ k@@ iens : &quot; this is due to the issu@@ ance of a permit for the creation of wind turbines according to plan law . &quot;
the circle confirmed the entrance of the so@@ lic@@ itation .
&quot; the corresponding writing are passed since last week in the district Vier@@ sen , stated a speaker .
the circle will take them to review the matter again .
they do not lead to it , that the process is stopped .
with a view of the Admin@@ istr@@ ative Court of the Admin@@ istr@@ ative Court , the circle was not dependent on the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette construction of four per 200 meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company had been involved in which the town of Vier@@ sen is involved in le@@ ase contracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of terrain .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this equ@@ ates to approximately one @-@ fifth of the power requirement of all four @-@ axle households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Four City &apos;s City Council formed a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park L@@ inn@@ s at Aachen , as well as participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

attractive offers on Saturday and the day of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potenti@@ als should be re @-@ determined or re @-@ decided .
they belong to the visitors and tourists .
but too many local people had lost the inner city once shopping .
at the end , everyone should contri@@ bute to the city centre - to r@@ enting the whole city and clubs .

the action under the spring of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make it clear that every citizen with his department will affect its direct environment itself .

a few people visited the Min@@ ist@@ aha Academy in the building of the Min@@ ist@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump continued after a continuous tran@@ scription of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the bound@@ ary .
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , he ordered Tr@@ ump into a telephone with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned limit .
the U.S. president den@@ oun@@ ced him because he had publicly broad@@ cast@@ ed the wall . he said to him , &quot; This is the press of the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his pre@@ sidential campaign with the promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and w@@ it to pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first calls with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m tournament were also published and revealed an amb@@ ivalent exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Im@@ ump , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; stu@@ pid , &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was made by the government , would like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would look like a &quot; land@@ fall of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after being said to Mr. W@@ ere , &quot; this is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford Mass@@ acre : activ@@ ists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as call for justice
a 1948 Ford Mercury went through a group of vie@@ wers in the rural Monroe , Georgia and r@@ ump to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , there came out a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a s@@ oftw@@ suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked straight through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the ins@@ ur@@ ers sh@@ attered in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie t@@ orn the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
lu@@ ck@@ ily this aw@@ ful scene was played on July 22 , only one supplement .
but if a sk@@ irt is cast out by Roger &quot; almost all in the audience , almost all in the audience came out .
since 2005 , civil rights to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford bridge back to the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - died in 1946 by the K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an .
no one was charged because of the murder .
&quot; it really is in@@ conce@@ iv@@ able that no one person was arrested in all those years - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Tyr@@ one Bro@@ oks , who helps establish the organization .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former member of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him , the appointment as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that was never correc@@ ted .
&quot; we want to be prosec@@ ution , we want cure , we want to cure , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconc@@ ili@@ ation , until we received justice . &quot;
a place of jurisdiction is put on a du@@ et over the cor@@ pse of one of the Mo@@ ore Ford &apos;s vic@@ tim on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI @-@ Ak@@ ten who received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding farms have been susp@@ ected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
nobody was then charged .
although the susp@@ ects has been on foot for decades , civil rights say that the double motiv@@ ation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always well @-@ known : policies and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice gave the black citizens to the first time in Georgia for the first time to dis@@ playing its voice during the summer .
at about the same time as the choice won by Roger Mal@@ com , Roger Mal@@ com moved a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , allegedly at a struggle , allegedly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ or had been in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby was wor@@ ried by her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison paid a famous white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , thus the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her co@@ us@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when she was moved away from prison , the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b moved by car .
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison who has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ se , &quot; includes a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is still form@@ ulated it .
&quot; it was a pol@@ ling mass@@ acre &quot; he said .
&quot; they were killed all to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you vote and if you vote , then you will happen . &quot;
during almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the yearly reference of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is clearly , gr@@ asp@@ ing , and is based in a type of deep rac@@ ism that many believed that he does not exist in America anymore .
it is difficult to look , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are con@@ fron@@ ted with its hem@@ at@@ ility in all , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen or hear , what I am doing through . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a do@@ zen white and the rest Black - in a room and l@@ ath@@ ered , as Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh here is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of chief C@@ rest member for years , but he said that the role will never be sim@@ pler .
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to obtain this story in life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester is tigh@@ tened and aff@@ lic@@ ted it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , give away my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona completely resist@@ s the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody knows ( at least all black actors ) into laughter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh at loud .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked La@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still g@@ ich@@ ern@@ d .
&quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; have said . &quot;
&quot; yet , &quot; p@@ ending one of the other black actors .
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos;@@ R. &apos; . &quot;
and precisely the energy in space , a feeling of camera operator re@@ placing the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy with it , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once more .
this time , when Ras@@ cona the N word says it says sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
this rep@@ et@@ ition ends viol@@ ent and fast .
it gives hor@@ ror , shots and then silence .
a woman who is cloth@@ ed with a g@@ rief , is about the balance of actors and endor@@ se alle@@ e holidays TRA@@ U@@ ER@@ N@@ DE Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred metres he@@ ighted a group of about four do@@ zen vie@@ wers swe@@ at swe@@ at and te@@ ars from the eyes .
the audience is split almost even@@ ly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , enrich@@ ed to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced Georg@@ ias impressive moisture every eight hours when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgri@@ mage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the Mor@@ de remained an Ane@@ cd@@ ote , but now if one is located on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ da showed , the air feels g@@ ate@@ ful .
when the last notes sound out , Gre@@ ene loads them to get closer and inspec@@ t the dead .
children ho@@ pes on their heads , record the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and wh@@ is@@ per each other .
&quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , when he would like to remember it .
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene &apos;s quantity - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actor throw the l@@ yn@@ rope away and cry out their te@@ ars .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , who played the man in the suit that the C@@ lan@@ tern has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona surrounded two of his players and then breaks into her arms we@@ eping , the emotional bur@@ dens breaks out with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing one of women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did it for a reason . &quot;
later the audience put together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of ha@@ iling from Atlanta is exc@@ ited about the reproduction with a black couple , which they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gles to find words , which feel the performance behind .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and de@@ eds to hear ... of people who look like yourself and what it will look like you like &quot; said they . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and de@@ eds that look like yourself and what they like
&quot; what really does me do with me , let me think that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today only police shooting is called &quot; . &quot;
in the same room Tyr@@ one Bro@@ oks Hof goes on his table , he e@@ ats and remin@@ ds of the Civil Rights .
he said he started planning a performance in the next year .
&quot; the post is in@@ spir@@ ing in a certain way , because it describes the ter@@ ror of what we inher@@ it , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it is so when we learn from it , then it can happen again .
who not studied his own history , who knows his own story is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ däm@@ merung &quot; reconc@@ iled to Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ um@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf lies on a multi@@ coloured @-@ term st@@ aging from gig@@ an@@ tic , six @-@ storey building .
the swivel platform ( designed by Ale@@ k@@ sand@@ ar DE@@ NIC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by road corner with mas@@ on@@ ry and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; pl@@ aste and a &quot; logo from East German Times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before , a open Mercedes @-@ classic car park in which Rh@@ en@@ ish as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls po@@ sieren now , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .

meanwhile , in Hollywood ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , they qu@@ it a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the great vintage Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heavy weight factor .
brutal the scene when he propos@@ es Siegfried .
in later Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) has to believe in .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
when the Fost@@ er , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who wor@@ shipped and dis@@ missed the hands for the Merkel @-@ space .
great appl@@ ause for the festival band that shows up for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in empty spaces .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his ra@@ ete@@ am .
in 2013 , in 2013 , he had to pass , in 2013 , he had to go a huge but@@ ter@@ head concert , where there were five years later , in which the occas@@ ional &quot; BU@@ H &quot; calls were defeated .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleased about this .
&quot; one notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a shape of peace with cast@@ orf , but also it was an understanding of sight .
I draw a positive conclusion .

Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kabul : NATO soldiers are killed in su@@ icide attacks
a su@@ icide file has been attacked by a military con@@ voy in Kabul , the capital of Kabul , killed , and several other in@@ ju@@ red , say sp@@ am@@ te .
five soldiers and a interpre@@ ter have been in@@ ju@@ red , a declaration of NATO .

the bom@@ bing was the last violence that made Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday there was a self @-@ murder two people in the proximity of the Ira@@ qi em@@ b@@ assy in Kabul .
in a statement by NATO , the explosion was held on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Af@@ gh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; of persons carried impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot;
the testimony told that all the last in a stable condition and in the US military hospital are treated on the Bag@@ ram &apos;s airport .
correspon@@ d@@ ents say that the growing strength of the Tal@@ ib@@ an and the group known as so @-@ called Islamic state ( IS ) in Q@@ at@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan , in the first half of 2017 , there were at least 1,@@ 662 civ@@ ilian victims in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .

&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ im said in a statement .
in June , the inten@@ tion of EPA had announced the o@@ zone determination - in which part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be fixed , where sub@@ sections must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mainly democratic states , along with the bor@@ ough of Columbia , nie@@ ce on Tuesday Kl@@ age and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ tire a wide range of environmental issues , as part of a wider agenda , as part of a wider agenda , to rec@@ ess economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have trig@@ gered the back@@ lash of the democr@@ ats and con@@ servation groups that wor@@ ry about the effects of greater emissions to public health .
the EPA website says that the in@@ hal@@ e of air , the o@@ zone does &quot; reduces the lung function and inten@@ si@@ fy the breath@@ es &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
Municipal Commun@@ e wants to provide common room
at the end the decision was clear : during two oppon@@ ents , the community of flu@@ e @-@ win@@ els dec@@ ides to set up a common room in the future community living .
in front of discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining property is signed , reported may@@ or Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although the Con@@ gregation is still last until the parish community has belonged to the community , but there is no planning for that of a private invest@@ or for the project more .
there is a discussion with respect to a common room .
one of the two investors still are in the boat , offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor he would provide a living area of around 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with a capacity of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and majority of the council bo@@ ars , such a common room is not as a meeting point just for the residents of the fair , but open to the community .
for example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ tan &quot; made a round .
reconc@@ ili@@ ation shall be the decision , which was pre @-@ decided by the provision of funds for the running household , through funding .
construction is located in the rehab@@ il@@ itation area .
the set of a common room would be , so T@@ j@@ ams will be able to transport 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision looks to sign the invest@@ or that you don &apos;t want to throw a b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , that is fixed in this regard - as well as P@@ ult@@ ran@@ ach - which makes the lifting height and the construction makes it possible - as possible .
un@@ necessary , so don &apos;t just mean Wilfried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps us : un@@ anim@@ ously passes the board .
it &apos;s not that simple to the common room .
Daniela Call references to the many own buildings with which you do not get so well ahead , but let us go with a common room in the window , says : &quot; I make me difficult to do . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a commun@@ al participation .
it looks behind this a conce@@ aled maximinum payout of property or even foreign investors .
unless it is not so , because with the purchase of the area you give no sub@@ si@@ dy , but receive a real , in the dou@@ b@@ able object , that is the opposite .
am@@ ig@@ ers request to inc@@ ur the decisions as a decision , finds three fe@@ ars .
so with two oppon@@ ents in the original programme , Stefan H@@ aller has summar@@ ized that , &quot; If we take the decision , we make a giant ride to conclu@@ de a giant in our infrastructure . &quot;

immig@@ rate to star in the Harz Mountains
the nation@@ wide first &quot; star@@ path &quot; will emer@@ ge in the Harz .
this is plans for the club observ@@ atory in Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a Planet@@ en@@ weg are available in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ path &quot; come to the needs of many har@@ ness visitors , whose name was .
he connect nature , science , movement and sporty performance .
members are aim@@ ing to catch up along the planned route and inform them about Stars and Star images .
in the first phase to 2018 , the association &quot; well achieved installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
enqu@@ iries to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ iß and Sie@@ ber .
information on boards should be completed by the Internet .
this is why we play a good mobile network at the site selection .
Acc@@ essi@@ bility to the criter@@ ion also .
the path to train is said to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the single stars , &quot; explained the club .
in addition they learned , why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , though it is much further away .
it will also be convey@@ ed to a selected star in which con@@ stellation was to be seen and when he was best .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg which is the highest situated Observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
the site in the middle of the National Park contains according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation to the six lowest regions in Germany .
frequently , from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt has been on the initiative of a Planet@@ arium based Planet@@ arium in Göttingen , somewhat similar to the planned star@@ base - the planetary observ@@ ations .
beginning in front of the bus@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , the planetary system forms up to Hain@@ berg and for the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; alien &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( congregation ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the ri@@ mp with the individual planets - including the D@@ warf planet P@@ lu@@ to point , are precisely placed in the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ unk so to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters from the sun measures 70 cen@@ timet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet is around four kilometers .
during the light of sun up to P@@ lu@@ to about eight hours , pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour up to st@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to .
pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed star would last a half year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time in discuss@@ ing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia who should stand in a collap@@ se course in order to ins@@ ist the most exciting pit struggle in the near future of 147 pounds , for the first time on Thursday .

when the couple printed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that would be a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be &quot; perfect size . &quot;
&quot; I am a former Fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; remember@@ ed Garcia .
&quot; I wo@@ ke up for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .

I would like to go to light weight .

they charge the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko approved .
&quot; boxes needs this struggle . &quot;
the climate asked if there should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , a part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko and a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to make an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell , after their anti @-@ weight title fight in the forum on September 23 .

four b@@ ays after re@@ ifen@@ plat@@ ings
on Thursday afternoon , four people were seriously in@@ ju@@ red during an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Zaf@@ ira arrived at 4.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the connection station , probably after a tire board the control of his vehicle .
the passenger car favor@@ able to the right to the em@@ bank@@ ment where it sur@@ pass and then remained on the roof in the ridge .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously in@@ ju@@ red at the accident .
during the first supply of the ver@@ ification by the rescue service , the A7 direction north for about an hour was closed , then traffic on the left side strips could be en@@ rolled along the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ mel Chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is ho@@ ping to start the season open@@ er at Braunschweig , after 2 : 2 marks the optim@@ isation of the def@@ ending sc@@ ans in Au@@ e points .
with the first seas@@ onal game Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , there would not have been the two oppon@@ ents at 2 : 2 vs. Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two oppon@@ ents too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge the Dre@@ mel chain should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a shut down , the Fort@@ unas will also not want to capture anymore .
&quot; for the future it will be so that no more beside Michael ( R@@ ensing ) puts it on line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew will even look better after his experiences in preparation with the tri@@ but@@ t chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we cannot aff@@ ord all the game errors . &quot;
of course Hoffmann is driving to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; but if one can &apos;t talk about a mis@@ cell@@ ed start , I do not know .
the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; if we want to focus on Sunday with four points and can focus on the tro@@ phy , we will surely be able to talk of a proper season open@@ er . &quot;
of that his trainer would not know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage against o@@ e , just because the game of Saxony had to be broken early because of an un@@ certain@@ ity .
&quot; now they can start the season as qu@@ asi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann might believe that the player from Au@@ e might be some fresh , because they couldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against any asc@@ en@@ sion favor@@ ites in bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent wher@@ ever they are at present , &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una .
although visitors come from the Rhin@@ eland as a lighter track on Sunday in the finally ( almost ) off stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that one must search from before , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Che@@ f@@ coach .
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and her@@ ed@@ itary . &quot;
and so Funk@@ y doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um assessment tests published
the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , showing a new method for medical ass@@ essing their age , show that more than 80 per cent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rid@@ dles medic@@ inal sal@@ et ) began with the accompl@@ ishment of tests last year .
they should measure the estim@@ ation of the age , after the Swedish mig@@ rant workers ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ ) , because of the condem@@ nation of the correct age of some refugees who were min@@ is@@ cent of age .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ operates 6,@@ 880 for testing cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results from a total of 2.@@ 481 testing of the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were ass@@ essed as 18 or older than in further 25 cases the FOR@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency projects that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; possibly under 18 is old . &quot;
tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent with the past few months .
&quot; we see no great difference in statistics for the past months , the numbers are fairly consistent , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been ass@@ essed as over 18 years , does not mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency published the findings of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 442 cases that I propos@@ e that that investig@@ ated person 18 years or older . &quot;
when the news Sven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det out the 5@@ 81 results published , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that she will be 18 years old .
the method of medical reti@@ rement is to be analysed at gy@@ ms and M@@ RI recordings of bricks produced by denti@@ sts and radi@@ olog@@ ists , was also critical in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tic is the end@@ oc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Instit@@ ution , whose work includes the evaluation of biological maturity of people to see if it so@@ oner or later as usual by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used .
to ass@@ ess the biological age in this way , is very un@@ safe .
if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has def@@ ended the accuracy of testing : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk , a child as an adult is essential to comp@@ ass@@ ing small .
the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are moving well .
on Wednesday a seven ton@@ ne concrete was installed on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good in the time , it runs great , &quot; says Reinhold Le@@ icht , building manager at the Department of road and traffic in the reg@@ istr@@ ative phase Freiburg .
at the same time work began in April at the same time at all three renov@@ ations between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , dres@@ sed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure stability and road security , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehab@@ ilit@@ ated .
the other two bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve and / or 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now reached a 1.@@ 30 meter width and seven tons , so called the bridge piece .
this is a random mount that is used as an operating path .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter width of bri@@ dging can be used on Friday .
then the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an went smooth@@ ly .
the particular thing is that it is about production parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company D@@ iz@@ wo .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge stages .
special f@@ inger@@ tips has the laying of lines through the work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the ro@@ omm@@ ates were informed in the advance of the work by hand@@ bal@@ lot about the project .
furthermore , fish and shell@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building and the collective in direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is controlled through a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge on the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher area , the street in the area of the bridge on the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked .
the cost of the three bridge rate is 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est at German Pot@@ ato Sal@@ ad
it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties must move on a strand , but when it comes to bring the alternative to Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is hard to bring with a hat .
the parties involved in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcan@@ ic ins@@ ist parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belongs to a broad alliance , which shows the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell , according to the poster &quot; large election campaign . &quot;
and his name on the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ dle , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forming the top duo for the Bundestag on 24 September , and Deputy Chief Executive Officer Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D plugs , but demonstr@@ ate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains col@@ ourful . &quot;
the town @-@ pic@@ nic was originally planned under the s@@ log@@ an &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Foun@@ tain @-@ square , but now takes place on the car park below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a coloured picture which offers himself .
and as Christa Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A world and one of the decisive organ@@ izers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , among them a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which may eat also the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman that brought him .
the police moved many offici@@ als to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence particularly at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
what did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ vul@@ if@@ l reports that he tried to make such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf was first asked for Dau@@ n , but there is a cancellation because of the already installed Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking spaces .
so the Ron@@ delle , Hom@@ pes are glad that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
with view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the right right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also does : against 20 clock provides a band of entertainment , including a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , several speakers , including the Af@@ gh@@ an @-@ pe@@ eling Af@@ D ch@@ air@@ woman Uwe Young .
in the room there are about 200 list@@ eners supposed to wait that the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in for the Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ l@@ ahl , Alice Wei@@ dle , and the vice @-@ president of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence is unchanged , but the offici@@ als had a quiet evening so far .
a little more than one hour last , the Af@@ D event takes guests on the court , but there is a longer breath , but also there is scheduled for 21 hours .
the police can abr@@ ze - no special events .
trombone meets trumpet
a re@@ hear@@ ken@@ ess with the Wolf@@ acher tromb@@ on@@ Freder@@ ic B@@ elli there are in the series Has@@ lau@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ Choir tomorrow , Sunday at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he meets a concert with the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or even &quot; Balk@@ ans fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winner and winner of numerous international competitions and have solo@@ ists in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter with the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchester Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both un@@ ites the l@@ ust , not just cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of the various gen@@ res .

but I want to try out all , Kri@@ sten Stewart did all open over her bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; if I rep@@ lied once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
the probably known relationship of Hollywood star was the &apos; Tw@@ il@@ ight &apos;s &quot; col@@ lie Robert P@@ att@@ in@@ son who ultim@@ ately went up bit@@ terly .
despite all this the brun@@ ette act@@ ress compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Bazaar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love each serious , whom I thought .
or do you believe about , I could have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten said that she bis@@ ex@@ ual was : &quot; I have lived in du@@ alism , and seriously believed .
so it has never been di@@ str@@ acted or obst@@ ru@@ cted me .
I liked it not yet to be taken seriously . &quot;

that really hurt me .

I felt really attacked , anx@@ ious and hum@@ ili@@ ated .

the Govern@@ or of West Virginia Cre@@ ates to prevent the Party
the Democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a manif@@ estation with President Tr@@ ump to prevent the party .
if you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have been away from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many pra@@ yers and many thinking ... today I will tell you as a residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manif@@ estation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ can , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a coach , I would say that at the time it is , another game to play . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement with the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice succeeded not forced the democratic can@@ did@@ acy in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was chosen in 2016 .
For@@ bes is certain that he own@@ s coal mines in five states and inher@@ ited a carbon mon@@ key by his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee set out a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said , &quot; the party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another impact for a Democratic Party that would like to work with us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and control of the least stat@@ utory bodies in history , the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from above to below without leadership , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said to the C@@ BS News .

&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress was achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this was not the moment to asser@@ t Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the cleaner athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; added

this divided the royal house on Thursday .
tradition@@ ally , the Danish royal family has been buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral .

the queen had agreed with the decision of her husband , and called it further in the communication .
where Prince Henrik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the inten@@ tion to join his French home .
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
he would like to be king after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
in 2016 he retired and put the title &quot; Princ@@ esses . &quot;

in a auto@@ biography , Henrik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ized .
my Danish was flu@@ ctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk scarf instead of kn@@ it@@ socks , Citro@@ ën instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of soccer .
even for the pal@@ ates I smoke instead of Virginia Tob@@ acco , and the reputation they had the reputation to be the brand of social intel@@ lec@@ tual intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ash@@ amed .
these were just two mist@@ akes ! &quot;
Prime Minister We@@ il want to gr@@ ate new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP of possible majority in Lower Saxony
N@@ ist &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid new election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to res@@ ume .
because on Friday night he spoke out for the dis@@ solution of the parliament .
the surprising withdrawal of a green de@@ pu@@ ties from their country@@ action in Lower Saxony did the government of Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) to a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the state elections the red @-@ green co@@ alition in Hanover lost their cr@@ acks a majority of the parliamentary majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP@@ ke T@@ rucks founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover .
CD@@ U @-@ group leader Björ@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend her to a faction .
the CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 68 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was conver@@ sely .
the new landing day will be elected regular on 14 January .
Th@@ üm@@ ler told , the red @-@ green state government can decide whether they could also gover@@ n them in this situation without a majority .
Stephan We@@ il continues to be ind@@ isp@@ ens@@ able that the country &apos;s day rapidly acceler@@ ates his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the state cap@@ tions also provides the opportunity that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament moves its trust and elec@@ ts a successor .
&quot; our const@@ itution offers several options .
these options must be leg@@ ally checked , &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler .
&quot; one will discuss all questions in peace if they are leg@@ ally checked . &quot;
Th@@ üm@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ward step &quot; but something tw@@ ios . &quot;
the polit@@ icians are st@@ ressed : &quot; I am no tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she signed as a trailer in black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens dem@@ anded the def@@ ending de@@ pu@@ ties to return their Land@@ tag@@ sm@@ and@@ ats .
&quot; we naturally go out of course that she has received its Land@@ tag@@ sm@@ and@@ at , which gives you over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; the state @-@ president Met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner with an immediate effect .
the Group &apos;s president of Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we re@@ gre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ill . &quot;
they deli@@ ber@@ ately op@@ ted , no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; also in front of the background that there was no content of content , we can &apos;t move this step . &quot;
the SPD @-@ Chancellor , Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the lower Sax@@ on Green Chamber of Lower Saxony for the CD@@ U as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green De@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al to the vot@@ ers and vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ y@@ al to Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the B@@ und@@ ou@@ ef of Socialists on Facebook .
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) , quickly re@@ elect the country &apos;s day .
the Austr@@ o @-@ Western holds Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
the polit@@ icians , in their past van@@ ity and in their fru@@ ust their personal interests in the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Salv@@ ation .
&quot; it is a sc@@ and@@ al that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is making this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ game and tries to beat them political capital . &quot;
the CD@@ U @-@ group leader Björ@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ thwest into the CD@@ U .
the parliamentary majority of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , thre@@ w the v@@ ests , with personal car@@ ri@@ er@@ ed@@ ness to sc@@ ru@@ b the result of the Agricultural Show in 2013 .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force between the SPD and the SPD were strongest in the country but a very thin majority of one vote .
the Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How to protect us from tox@@ icity , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discuss@@ ing about p@@ seu@@ do eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al pass ?
how can consumers protect yourself .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) Agriculture Minister ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the ed@@ itorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumers protect from po@@ ison@@ ing eggs ?
I can only encour@@ age all consumer speakers in your refrigerator and to inspec@@ t the eggs in your refrigerator .
the German states on the consumer protection portal www.@@ foo@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de establ@@ ishes the latest information about the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even , if after all we know , health end@@ ang@@ ering is virtually impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Federal Minister is not really perce@@ ived ?
the food monitoring is the role of the German states .
however , my house has ce@@ ased immediately and has been revealed to Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has just as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are reason@@ ably harm@@ less and health .
if in the middle of the resi@@ dual amount of 0,@@ 005@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time does not school the farms .
sitting production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the relevant knowledge the production of production hits no immediate fault .
they must reck@@ on due to mut@@ ual illegal inter@@ ns of service companies with economic damages .
as always there is little check@@ er in the harvest .
is it missing only on the staff or also the concl@@ usive behaviour ?
however , they were just the official controls which have exposed the process .
however , the truth also includes that food was and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
just this is a consequ@@ ence of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can occur , of decisive importance .
I have already made many times clear that I expect a comprehensive search declaration by the responsible authorities .
is regular Al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to receive exclusively secure and convenient food .
if a non @-@ approved in@@ sec@@ tic@@ ide should be used in food industry , Consumer and Consumer declar@@ es consumer .
by pan@@ ze@@ e funds manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers in a situation is od@@ d , which is absolutely not necessary .
generally it must be clear : the correct use of the in@@ sec@@ tic@@ ist Fi@@ on@@ il is not acceptable in the post@@ age of food distribution . it must not be acceptable and must be immediately left prompt@@ ly .
it must be consistent on all levels and work with high pressure .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atom@@ ic fact is quick and comprehensive .
how the rules of the football rules on Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ ym@@ ars World tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences of the UEFA extends to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , as the executive organisation and the European game monitors the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play Rules , which have been sum@@ mon@@ ed in 2011 from the UEFA Cup , mean that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to remove the Braz@@ ilians from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a sal@@ ary which will amount to $ 10 million a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars to France .
PSG - in order to make money to the money , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is subject to a galax@@ y of other stars , because of the financing of the team by the energy rich ruler of Qatar .
Ver@@ eine may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to take leg@@ itim@@ ate deposits , which enable them to reach the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , elected to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that Ver@@ eine had taken trem@@ end@@ ous in their vic@@ tim to success trem@@ end@@ ous deb@@ ts , effectively troubled , aff@@ ir@@ c@@ ate , when banks or owners have with@@ drawn their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P declined by the concentration of the clubs on monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model was originally used in Chelsea - the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested strongly to enhance the crew and build a global brand - become a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , it runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini joined the Pre@@ gn@@ ity in 2015 , his UEFA sequ@@ el Ale@@ ks@@ ander will continue to continue to dis@@ pute over exc@@ essive expenditure .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will inten@@ si@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA für FF@@ P , vers@@ us The Associated Press in the last week .
although the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has paid in a package , it can distri@@ bute the amount of invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the aggreg@@ ates will amount to CHF 4@@ 4.6 million for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanc@@ tions in 2014 saw the PSG - together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most difficult sanc@@ tions .
the group received a fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later lower@@ ed to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season has been held to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEFA extends to search for clubs who could try to over@@ look their income by companies who are joined by the owners who are involved in the owners of a club .
during a cat@@ ar@@ tic company the sp@@ onder@@ s could exceed if the value of Spon@@ sor@@ ship should exceed the default market rates , the UEFA would not apply as a leg@@ itim@@ ate income .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that PSA was founded by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PSG - Pay@@ ments of the World Cup will be in Qatar in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar have cont@@ ested that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Championship amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be an easy to find out and an excellent man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ ators .
the hi@@ ther@@ to sanc@@ tions against im@@ posed that the UEFA even will be ob@@ sc@@ ared , taking into account any attempt to re@@ mind the rules .
the UEFA had no previously prepared talks with PSG by Ne@@ ym@@ on Transfer , on Thursday the People who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of the an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG @-@ situation .
the latest reports show that the 2015 / 16 generated sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last business year need to be published .
PSG - Ne@@ ym@@ on arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , mer@@ chand@@ ising and Jersey .
the association ass@@ umes that sales after the signing will increase by at least 30 per cent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ating to see one of the top football player go , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ars im@@ pul@@ ley by claim@@ ing that PSG ProntoSIL FF@@ P would hurt .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial Dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar .
Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares of La Liga against a state that financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequ@@ ence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country own@@ s an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the fair Fair@@ play , because you have different ways to have different ways , if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ g@@ il@@ ie@@ ver
in the past few years is the Chocol@@ ates Frey board @-@ chocolate produced for Swiss .
now the s@@ oc@@ ieties are in front of a possible end : the airline creates new job .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Me@@ ike Fu@@ hl@@ r@@ ott confirmed the news agency &quot; North West Germany &quot; on request of the news agency .
according to current planning , Air@@ line will close a new contract during the first half of 2018 .
the products would have checked every two to three years and reviewed quality check .
&quot; we are very pleased with the current suppliers chocol@@ at Frey , &quot; said spokes@@ person .
in 14 grams , approximately 17 million small red @-@ white package panels spread over 14 grams a year before landing on the passengers .
Swiss does not want to make any information about the costs .
Bran@@ chen@@ in@@ sider estimate the order volume according to &quot; North West Germany &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros Dau@@ gh@@ ter achieved an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly , the advertising effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ g@@ ih@@ erst@@ eller , it is a prestigious order .
as many applic@@ ants arri@@ ves at the new call , Swiss does not want to bet@@ ray Swiss .
but only Swiss producers are coming in question .
according to the newspaper article , chocol@@ at Frey aims to de@@ stri@@ ve a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da the largest Swiss chocolate maker was not able to reach a statement .
chocolate panels distributed Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss Life concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut plant in collaboration with Hubert &apos;s chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss made a half past two and a half years with the launch of the Chocol@@ at Frey .
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producer .
on long distance flights , the customers of First Class with le@@ ak@@ ies are spo@@ iled by the conf@@ is@@ eries Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the business class accommodation Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lind@@ t and the Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from chocol@@ at Frey .

as cultural ar@@ tif@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and a bo@@ died of our Facebook @-@ enabled era permanent memories .
but when Fran@@ chise feels it , when the time would barely take place .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was sur@@ pris@@ ingly good , not just because of his ab@@ sur@@ d hum@@ ors ( it contained an original history for a talking tin vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by rele@@ asing it on the core of the G@@ ags - actor middle age play el@@ derly children to grow up - they managed to win the last part of the wid@@ ow .

at one point , a character turns into a character through a Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a series of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .

&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon has a different kind of nost@@ alg@@ ia : the revi@@ val of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even for &quot; GLO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ thro@@ es @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .

in addition , offici@@ als presented larger quantities of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand Euros .
two persons were arrested at the tim@@ pan@@ ien in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two pres@@ um@@ ably will probably be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian Er@@ ators were involved in this promotion .
over 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the members of the Maf@@ ia is organised drug criminal , severe violence , rejected by mur@@ dering as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ pressing .

the data will thus be admin@@ istered after about 600 fore@@ ign@@ ers in Germany .
since the data has not been suff@@ ici@@ ently cultivated , the data quality in parts have not been well known so far .
in some cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by men who have long since become a citizens , or citizens , who have become the German citizens and should not have to dive more in its register . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have ste@@ amed the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England war@@ ned that the economic growth &quot; jobs &quot; will remain in when they kept the interest rates on a family household in the middle of a reinforced pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Mon@@ etary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 for reducing interest rates to 0,25 % , where@@ by less members had a rise in this month as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened its support .
in its quarterly annual inflation forecast , the Bank reduced their growth pro@@ gn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 at 1.6 % and predic@@ ted that the pressure would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but they signed that in the next few years , interest income would be necessary to grow by the Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the credit cost may be more than expected at the financial markets .
the members also voted to re@@ treat a part of mam@@ mot@@ h business cycle that was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will be provided time for finance plans to provide for banks , as from the upcoming February budget funding available for banks , though it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with a minimum of 115 billions of pounds .
after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC , gross domestic product remains weak , as the pressure on households continues to result . &quot;
in interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain amount of monetary policy for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; extent required would be expected when the markets are expected .
markets in the third quarter of the next year and one another in 2020 forecast .
the Bank however , emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; stages &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be limited . &quot;
the Bank predic@@ ted down@@ wards in the Bank for this and next year , compared to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the next year .
it has maintained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound did according to these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change is made after the most recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth rate the rising expectations to a interest rate and the GDP increased in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly reco@@ ver@@ ing after the bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusi@@ asm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and slightly different obe@@ di@@ ence , as the f@@ sub@@ mission is even worse before they become better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated for a lower consumer spending .
the decision is a year following lower@@ ing of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the Sin@@ ken &apos;s sin@@ king .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and economy completely .
prior to the final judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call rose to a rate of interest rates , because inflation was climbed to a hard rise in July , with three political decision makers in July .
inflation was dropped by 2.9 % in June in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was exp@@ ec@@ tedly stim@@ ulated in the coming months .
the Bank said that the leader in relation to its target of 2 % be &quot; quite a weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ fort , Director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shorter withdrawal of the sw@@ ap ran@@ ates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be stronger , as the loan is to be di@@ mm@@ ed according to shops and the year in a positive manner .
the market looks especially good for those who are running out the existing dy@@ ke and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are complete , and many are always popular with toll free options and low rates . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) Sh@@ ru@@ pted HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10.000 people
patients will be entitled to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV pre@@ ven@@ tive treatment in September after a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that an initial risk of risk reported prior to intercourse has been reduced by around 86 percent before the risk of risk involved in high risk analysis and is now delivered from heal@@ thcare services via a first three @-@ year study for estimated $ 10,000 people .
he was ready to finance the trial , having confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court in the past year , that the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
the announced ch@@ ai@@ red was announced by N@@ HS England by Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as the &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) that described as a decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brig@@ h@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are to be considered to be followed by men , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure promised ph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV pre@@ ach@@ ments that are taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV @-@ transmission of infection .
pre@@ p prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medic@@ ations in the body of a person exists to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .
for those who come in question , g@@ ay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners , who were not successfully treated .
clinics can identify which the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have an affili@@ ate , whose HIV status is not known as an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who are registered in England and register with a household in@@ ric@@ ian , can also op@@ t @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medication that week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study aims to ass@@ ess the entire potential of pre@@ p , extrac@@ ted and implemented in large scale , as well as in large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be far @-@ increasing and increasingly successful efforts to reduce the prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades pro@@ long@@ ed progress in fav@@ or of one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at the NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p when target@@ ed to ne@@ edy and end@@ ang@@ ered people , the ability to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September to people , people with high HIV @-@ risk to develop in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not having a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives .
we welcome all of this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , president of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV .
now , since the pre@@ p test medicine was provided , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ health minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome according to monthly che@@ ering and delayed execution by the government .
evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection can end .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible in all country , to protect people who are HIV inf@@ ects and that it will ac@@ company the inf@@ usion of spre@@ ading HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and smart designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former banking press with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her pockets and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ce@@ il@@ ings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a nice layout - one had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - supp@@ er Jo@@ anne St@@ aur@@ aum and add a mezzanine to keep the spacious ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ce@@ il@@ ings , large windows , much light .
it was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the Archit@@ ect and Design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill that was able to use a home at 12.5 feet high ce@@ il@@ ings , not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the archit@@ ect@@ onic challenge was able to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
this fan had to think creative thinking to solve the default .
&quot; the steel plant is rather complicated , &quot; explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were over@@ st@@ acked , without that we had to answer .
it was not just about to build a simple platform , but to create the steel that it had the right height or bottom . &quot;
this arrangement enabled it to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down over the gl@@ am@@ orous home area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting use the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role when adding the theatre , space and light .
there is a short cor@@ ridor mir@@ ro@@ red on both ends to work for longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance there are mir@@ ro@@ red units place for all kinds and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by the per@@ c@@ eption of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
folding kit@@ chens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a gar@@ land door .
&quot; a bit engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; it &apos;s opposite so that if you push the door open , very slightly gli@@ des . &quot;
thanks to the smart use of space and storage room Jo@@ anne could win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreci@@ ated , &quot; said Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a corrupt form , a real estate bro@@ ker occur and a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space , while simultaneously use high quality materials , which provide the space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and so are helping to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can change by good design and increased square met@@ ers@@ itude of some default in something quite amazing .
indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fight for a 500 million dollar @-@ dollar @-@ emp@@ ire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ n@@ asty , in a con@@ front@@ ation because of one of the biggest real estate site Vic@@ tor@@ ias in value of over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and the Col@@ in De Lut@@ is lives in a villa on To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clar@@ ify it as her own property and business .
as early as early as 2014 Paul wanted to withdraw from family business , but a sharp dis@@ pute concerning the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 poss@@ ess a value of more than half a billion dollar . since the family started a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood , in 1973 .
the West@@ co Jeans family founded there and grew up to 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio by De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city of Brun@@ sw@@ ick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ bs .
after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - from Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul is about one third .
a file of jurisdiction that this means that Col@@ in poss@@ esses a value of € 316 million and Paul in value of 176 million dollars .
the division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the proposed partners proposed by Col@@ in proposed him to leave him for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it .
last Friday , after several failed viol@@ ations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers also struggle for control over the existing business - which Col@@ in , like Paul claimed to be excluded .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul , some concern himself to manage .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , it was filed by Col@@ in , he says he will trust the dis@@ pute .
&quot; my Italian heritage is writing that the family is the most important priority . &quot; he wrote .
the costs are in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , em@@ ails and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides dangerous lawyers .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her dece@@ ased husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants starting from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Brun@@ sw@@ ick in the early 1950 &quot; s .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood her@@ itance , where Col@@ in opened first je@@ ans@@ ers of the family .
Col@@ in said that he was there , when he was &quot; High School &quot; in my last years , when Paul was still a child ( 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is tells her that she and Luigi who died in 2012 , ho@@ ped to share their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the Brothers of Court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group , and Col@@ in claims that Mark while leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid .
both Luke and Mark , Paul : &quot; says Paul &quot; about the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very re@@ trac@@ ted , though it was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax media took us in contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; I really cannot say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad to understand that my brother Paul has decided to compl@@ ain about and to draw our family name by courts &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to ful@@ fill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have won , that Paul and I would end in our current dis@@ pute , &quot; he said and added that he was still waiting for a solution . &quot;
on Friday those hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our aff@@ air will be resol@@ ved by the courts &quot; in the near future , &quot; wrote Col@@ in .
m@@ umps is planning to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly might actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POLI@@ TI@@ CO reports that the new Chief of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the media - in the hope , the b@@ oss on an equivalent course .
here is a piece by Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of White House , he set up a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump white House , which he repair wool : bad information that would ro@@ de into the hands of the pre@@ sid@@ ents .
Kelly told the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in post@@ ings - because of the president will meet better decisions when he would get good information . &quot;
K@@ ell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to im@@ itate tr@@ ump , monitor his media .
President Tr@@ umps relationship to television reaches decades - and now where he is in the White House , its TV is still strong .
&quot; if the Candi@@ date was er@@ adi@@ c@@ ated because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting advis@@ or Sam N@@ un@@ berg , in February opposite POLI@@ TI@@ CO .
polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , m@@ umps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it consists of control , according to six former election campaign officers in it , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
al@@ right now .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps has ever been &quot; under control &quot; has been ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps these campa@@ igns have something that we do not know other - that Tr@@ umps has even more combust@@ ible items without their inter@@ ven@@ tions .
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ et , the tr@@ ump not sent .
if his staff had made it a few times , anger from him , then their efforts have been well worth it .
but no one has consistently avoided it that Tr@@ ump &apos;s contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al causes .
a part of the problem exists that people together in a White House , which is composed of comp@@ eting parties , always trying to present their own agenda , which promotes tr@@ ump material , which may promote their views from the world .
POLI@@ TI@@ CO - quite busy with this story in May , the pre@@ ference of the consult@@ ants that pre@@ sided over the pre@@ diction for strategic reasons .
this was an example taken by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ Be@@ am@@ te say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press @-@ outs , particularly such with damaged le@@ cs , and that he can be conf@@ ident to find out from wh@@ ence they come .
just that happened in late February when som@@ eb@@ ody returned to the president of an article by Got@@ sch@@ .com , the website of the Internet prov@@ oc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who was the dep@@ uty Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , who decided to be the source behind a bunch of Lec@@ ks &apos; in the White House .
although Johnson was sc@@ anned because of sc@@ iss@@ ors perman@@ ently from Twitter , or that he did not have any specific evidence or expressed in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
gold macher , added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly attemp@@ ts three months later , the same to do .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and its advis@@ ors still seek influence .

since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will pray and ho@@ ped .
the police de@@ fle@@ w throughout Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to the dangerous crime on the run .
since the addresses of the requested words are not known naturally , are references from the population ho@@ pes and pra@@ ying .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action on Friday , which follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; calendar of winter .
the experiences could have been shown that many fle@@ c@@ ous people are h@@ iding at the side of Euro@@ pol .
I have put 21 postcards for selected cri@@ min@@ als from 21 EU countries .
the site www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been available since 2016 , more than 2.5 million times this year .
36 of the Online Heal@@ u@@ pers were able to have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to their publication on the website .
travel@@ ers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s Series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ th@@ iest hom@@ e@@ owners of the West Mi@@ dl@@ ands are back with some resol@@ ute travel@@ ers in war , which are bred by the commun@@ e , to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sion houses .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ thy road of Soli@@ hull which is called the Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they have horses , babies , and an army of tran@@ sports , having been kick@@ ed out in May , without having been forced from the council to prevent her acc@@ idents .
the tak@@ eover group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles by a section which remained un@@ obst@@ ru@@ cted to find a way .
desert residents aff@@ lic@@ ted the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless &quot; with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous resident said , &quot; You &apos;re on Monday evening after they were sent forward by Bentley He@@ ath where stones have thrown on the passage .
the Council must be forced to implement in fact when dealing with the problem was us@@ eless .
the travel@@ ers were in May there , moved on and are now back again .
more were yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by giving long sub@@ direc@@ tives to protect their parks .
I live at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my municipal tax when the Council can stop this again . &quot;
a ro@@ omm@@ ate , who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of those travel@@ ers only to be pl@@ ot@@ ed by another round .
the numbers have raised time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
speaking of the Council of Soli@@ hull : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary steps to take them as fast as possible .
in order to support our reference collection , it is very important that as many people register an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this is to do with a picture of the situation , in which the dish has to check , when we propos@@ e our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Luise
from the former hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Luise is situated .
the house in front of the Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts doors are being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing time of the Hotel Birken@@ hof , the renovation of the Hotel Birken@@ hof were lost around 30 000 nights per ann@@ um during the time of the city of Birken@@ hof as of 13 April 2014 .
in autumn 2014 , despite a dramatic increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which took care of contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al discussion .
the city pre@@ vent@@ ri@@ fied the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by the list of the construction plan to secure the area as hotel location .
the decision was not und@@ isp@@ uted in the council at that time .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel site and spoke of serious pro@@ spective customers at the same time .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ de@@ ans with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a volunte@@ er auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the Group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men .
you are called Hotel Luise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Luise and now Wald@@ hotel Luise .
at the previous hotel Birken@@ hof , since longer time construction container are available in front of the entrance , and when one entering the house is notice@@ able , how extensive renov@@ ations are performed .
the floors have been t@@ orn , ce@@ il@@ ings to be assembled , old bath@@ ers from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer &apos;s talk with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are furnished in large shower , the input area is designed and new windows are installed .
everything that later is &quot; beautiful . &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressed .
&quot; we want to do a jewel . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you can &apos;t rely on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher level of downtown , emphas@@ izes sound .
the Wald@@ hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms are wool , and explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he had already led talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourist director Michael Krause , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer did not want to determine exactly following the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer .
just under a million euro , he expects .
outside the external plants are also given to the front , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace ar@@ ises from the restaurant , which is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. Com@@ ple@@ tion Com@@ es Grand Jury
in Russia @-@ aff@@ air about US President Donald Tr@@ ump to have set a special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller to a report so called Grand Jury .
in recent weeks , the Panel wrote the work recorded by the &quot; Wall Street Journal , conf@@ id@@ ential persons under appeal .
the newspaper marked the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded his investigation and inten@@ si@@ fied his investigation .
the CN@@ N station reported that I already give first inv@@ it@@ ations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps or a Russian lawyer .
us secret services compl@@ ain the Kre@@ m@@ lin for longer to have mixed a mixed in the 2016 pre@@ sidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether they gave foreign languages between Tr@@ umps Association and Moscow .
in the focus of investig@@ ations , several men are going to act as a consultant to the Republi@@ can League .
in fact , Mu@@ eller took also more and more Tr@@ ump &apos;s private and commercial environment under the magn@@ ifying glass .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally bri@@ dged and the acc@@ us@@ ation , whether the President may be obst@@ ru@@ cted by the president in the course of the aff@@ air .
to check and decide whether the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to test and decide if charges should be charged .
therefore Grand jur@@ ies are therefore also called the Indi@@ ct@@ ment .
they are usually switched on when it is about bigger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to submit people to per@@ c@@ eption .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ it@@ ations were issued to turn the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were issued at a statement , named it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ umps were also standing advis@@ or and mother @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his German election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts say on Thursday evening in the U.S. TV that Mu@@ eller will not aband@@ on himself in his work , and that he should be necessary to respon@@ d quickly .
however , if the Grand Jury will not be turned on at the end , the Grand Jury will decide on the survey of an indictment .
yet the suspension of the committee of the beginning of a new phase in investig@@ ations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new dis@@ closure of the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia in order to represent the Russia Aff@@ air as a campaign of its political oppon@@ ents .
&quot; the Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the subject give the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
his special advis@@ or T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he kn@@ ow@@ eth nothing from the integration of a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , st@@ ressed .
the White House endor@@ se all measures that acceler@@ ated the work of the special investig@@ ator to &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey told three times that will not be determined against the President .
one has no reason to perce@@ ive that something has changed to it , called it in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired .
because of this R@@ aus@@ wur@@ st , you have become a c@@ ass@@ es@@ ity against tr@@ ump , and he would like to im@@ press the justice .
Com@@ ey said in June before an Senate committee , Tr@@ ump gave him a cess@@ ation of investig@@ ations against the then national security advis@@ or Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President is under big pressure because of the investigation .
according to the US media , the White House collected material against the special investig@@ ator and its employees .
the de@@ qu@@ est spec@@ ulation over it , whether tr@@ ump cap dis@@ missed .
unlike an independent special investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Water@@ gate @-@ Aff@@ air , Mu@@ eller has re@@ produced a position in which he could be fired in the theoretical session of the President of the Department of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of re@@ publi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators arrived on Thursday &apos;s legisl@@ ations , after which the special investig@@ ator could no longer be released .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gig@@ an@@ tic ice berg p@@ ushes in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the western arc@@ tic ice , a gig@@ an@@ tic ice@@ berg has solved the barely seven times of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this attended the Bre@@ mer@@ h@@ av@@ ener Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the above one tr@@ illion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 sq km big Kol@@ oss driver now north and will probably need two , three years until it had mel@@ ted .
it is 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest Ice giant , the researchers have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people goes not out of him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the quar@@ ry &apos;s break@@ down , is un@@ clear according to research .
in total , however , for approximately 30 years , there has been an unusual collap@@ se of ice sk@@ ids in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a facsimile background .
according to many researchers , it could be related to warming .
now the Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it is therefore always growing ste@@ adily into the sea and crash@@ es regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this shooting was the equ@@ il@@ ibri@@ um of w@@ axes and break off several years ago .
a complete shot @-@ fe@@ i was to fall there , writes AW@@ I research Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a matter that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge has never been drawn far as far as currently .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate under@@ stands the voltage and could be broken in case of a key place .
the f@@ usions of fe@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg increases the sea level , because they pushed on the water , and ice it so much water , as it yiel@@ ds to the melting itself .
however , loss of fe@@ ar@@ iness leads to light the gl@@ acier directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , however , only in the low degree , writes the British research project to observe Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Midas ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometers .
the mainland by the mainland is up to 700 metres thick , along the front edge towards the free ocean some 200 metres .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; even though there is a natural happening and is no direct connection to climate change , the ice @-@ label now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the longest re@@ treat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed .
among scientists be contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is res@@ umed to be back or long @-@ term , perhaps his colle@@ ague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models said that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if this re@@ sear@@ cher lead the ab@@ rupt@@ cy of this gig@@ an@@ tic ice r@@ ame not to climate change , so many ice sk@@ ating the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have been cr@@ ushed in recent decades .
this long ker@@ is of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have gone back to 28 000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s .
the decline was contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have war@@ med up around three degrees around the past 50 years , so that the temperature in which the temperature is the quick@@ est .
CD@@ U wants to save pet at the staff
because it is more difficult to occup@@ y jobs , the CD@@ U calls for the CD@@ U to become more attractive to the emplo@@ yer .
only shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has left 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and offici@@ als work for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now you have 17 tra@@ inees in their first day of work .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
around 620 candidates were able to record sales in this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to meet staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still not occupied by the circle M@@ ett@@ mann in front of 50 .
among other things , doctors and engineers are searched as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to con@@ quer the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to con@@ front the trade in the administration .
management should ac@@ company a concept to personnel and human development after the wish of the parties . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term con@@ servation of professionals , but to op@@ pose the candidate short@@ age , is called it .
the overall concept has to ori@@ ent@@ ate inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ vers@@ al and a training offensive , requ@@ iring CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has done it with personnel problems that you used to know so much earlier .
other towns advert@@ ise good offici@@ als and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition of the public emplo@@ yer . &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age related to the service .
the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , President of the CD@@ U , continues beyond the joint proposal .
he wanted to make a f@@ ist big surprise for a f@@ ist big surprise , when he presented the number of personnel publicly in question and the other parties flo@@ ur@@ red .
people want all the ways to check out a withdrawal from the municipal emplo@@ yer .
&quot; if we are not at short notice of a satis@@ factory solution , the county seat should be sc@@ attered with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the circular cities - a domestic fee , &quot; so peoples .
thus , the CD@@ U also tries to pay more than the employee and offici@@ als better than the T@@ ari@@ for@@ d@@ ding to the Public Service .
the sal@@ aries are currently ex@@ empl@@ ated , increases or more money , only if one changes in a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle always grew more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be furnished in which employees of the new pro@@ state protection law shall take care of .
not least through the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and round@@ director Martin Richter have a problem . they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the sound to NGO @-@ mig@@ rants Res@@ cue Life
Italy has war@@ ned NGO &apos;s rescue boats for mig@@ rants in the Mediterranean where they may not continue , if they do not keep on new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs send no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ nit@@ is war@@ nings came out a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Res@@ et &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with human hands in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immig@@ ration .
the relief organisation , which only has been in operation since one year , is refused to express detailed operations of the Italian Prosecutor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ ons .
&quot; for us , and stays the salvation of human life to be our top priority . so , it is very sorry that we cannot perform in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in a statement about the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth Res@@ et &apos; , which super@@ vised the I@@ u@@ venta , since October 2007 .
it is assumed that his crew will be delivered boat @-@ mig@@ rants who can directly ride them directly from human hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that ships can be used .
at least one such meeting took place , only 1,3 miles before the Lib@@ yan coast took place , according to the charges of the Public Prosecutor , whose contents have been published by Italian media .
the crew is susp@@ ected of susp@@ ected of the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , the ev@@ ac@@ uation races in the zone of humanit@@ arian reasons and not monitored by any other mot@@ ifs .
boats must be used under the code of conduct , boats as the I@@ u@@ venta bo@@ xed all of an Italian police officers who monitors their activities .
just three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and life operations , have now ready to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said that the new rules were un@@ necessary , but acceptable would not be acceptable since they would not be &quot; essential changes or dis@@ abilities . &quot;
among those who refused to sign , the Nobel Peace Prize organization is physi@@ ci@@ ans without fron@@ ti@@ ers ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of mig@@ rants that had declined strongly after the lif@@ egu@@ ards in Italy in recent weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Lib@@ yan coastal defence and collabor@@ ate with local Americans .
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister .
he gave plans for further discussions with Lib@@ yan civil rights in this month over economic development initi@@ atives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of mig@@ rants that leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine We@@ il@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the Berlin &apos;s foreign post@@ mark &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nor@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days long tri@@ als and sights .
there three assigned guides were available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ kap@@ elle above De@@ id@@ es@@ heim .
it followed outlook points , partly on towers , one of which could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the pre @-@ bearing levels .
in between there , there was more asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest &apos;s litter market .
again points out to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flow@@ y &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
during the last two days a lot of altitude had been announced .
caves , rocks , towers , cast@@ les , ruins and rec@@ ur@@ ring brought will@@ ing@@ breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the Bik@@ er in the open air field hal@@ low@@ ing sole .
Neustadt was also headed .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald at its best side - sporty and cul@@ tur@@ ally .
console instead of r@@ acket - Bundesliga is preparing for E @-@ Sport
sitting the sport stars on the future before computer con@@ soles , instead of swe@@ ating on wind and weather over the stadium to fight ?
fact : E @-@ Sport has long since become a serious business sector , too lu@@ cr@@ ative business - huge stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high pl@@ agues .
they have also recognized the first federal states that increasingly eng@@ age in this area .
in the start of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and at the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department at mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Chief Apostle Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
it is sure that this train does not rise any further . &quot;
at the coming weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA Club in London organ@@ izes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , where gam@@ ers joined the different club .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , e.g. Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in E @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real soccer you need to sit in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old that young people will go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 year old .
and : the attempt to tem@@ pt all possible markets , especially the Asian , to con@@ quer .
with prominent electric sport@@ s@@ men under contract it could be more often to be present on these markets , than only once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ us@@ ness to Asia .
what &apos;s it exactly about it ?
in the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the soccer simulation for FIFA .
long ago , as in normal sports , have established the pro@@ s in which the pro@@ s joined one another .
and in the Asi@@ en@@ play 2006 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a correct sport @-@ art ?
for many , the performance is safe to use .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ial has also faced a long time with the question .
for the Professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions one can also find increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
there is also cogn@@ itive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also mind their body and pay attention to your diet .
&quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot;
stro@@ us also looks problems : &quot; Dop@@ ing is increasingly concerned about . &quot;
checks are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport was lack@@ ing .
scientists have a positive impact of the research integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are international on the way , like a global global family there is no internal cultural sight .
a study by the management consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Internal Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport as rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 this has been converted into Germany over 50 million Euros , mainly on advertising , spon@@ sor@@ ing and great tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
against the mere 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga , this is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport is not far from the other established sports such as Hand@@ ball , Basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International many countries are already on .
great markets are Asia and the US where the ex @-@ bas@@ eline Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez joined the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competitions Un@@ ik@@ r@@ n .
in Europe too much is happening .
E @-@ Sport was introduced in a Norwegian school , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ initial League @-@ Ver@@ eine @-@ Dut@@ ch@@ man has now comm@@ ited to create an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany has left behind &quot; says V@@ f@@ B President Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only falling in nost@@ alg@@ ia , and the old times to clar@@ ify is no longer enough today .
it is therefore that the tradition of the association will preserve it , but the company is simultaneously engaged in the modern market .
&quot; we live in a dig@@ iti@@ ful world , &quot; mean also Dut@@ ch@@ man .
&quot; there you can &apos;t hold it fast , that only when football , it remains as it was . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy to su@@ icide in su@@ icide
a woman from Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts was sentenced to two and a half years , because they encour@@ aged their friend by texts and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their sentence behind bar@@ n and five years have been exposed at local currency .
Carter was convic@@ ted in June for the issue of Conrad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ con@@ sol@@ ous .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free to appeal .
she had been con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum of 20 years , but her legal representatives were ar@@ gu@@ ed that they suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
in red p@@ ants and a cream coloured blo@@ use , Carter found out with te@@ ars in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes as she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; their actions published Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ ney at the court .
&quot; they finished his life to make their own better .
she has taken no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters tried his lawyer , it is a &quot; aw@@ ful out@@ break that they would like to thank them . &quot;
judge Lawrence Moniz Galvao , however , he did not find out that you have &quot; old or Mat@@ eg@@ rad or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
an acc@@ or@@ ney ret@@ ched a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lynn Roy doing that there is no day that I do not wor@@ ry the loss of my beloved son .
I would like to be proud of me and how I would like to go with everything . I try to bear with all of my sor@@ eness , which we are for etern@@ ity to be with us for his sisters . &quot; says it .
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dyn Roy , said that it will be prosec@@ uted of the knowledge &quot; and will never be able to participate in the wedding of their brother or a a@@ unt for his children .

in the Audi Cup , Joshua were allowed to run as a captain .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Conf@@ ed Cup winners a big season at - Extra motiv@@ ation does not shr@@ ink .
something was different from his place in the cabin , that says Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing is very small .

sugar is distributed at most of those who wish to dar@@ nel in the mood .
so who has been au@@ c@@ anned the he@@ ir from Lah@@ ti , can only use a small extra motiv@@ ation only .
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; that is what you would like to take responsibility . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was held on Wednesday as Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right back , that is now its position , the white bin@@ ds in the arm did her b@@ rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i took part in this start@@ up like that , who can also take the rud@@ ders in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ wrapped tro@@ upe .
he had views of the whole , while many others were busy himself .
Vid@@ al thus strug@@ gling to play his missing fitness ( folding not only ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on a devil come out to the services of Asia &apos;s journey ( folding only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Nik@@ las Sü@@ le to come down in their first concert in the Bavaria Tri@@ kot .
the same goes very well .

companies pleased with the rh@@ iz@@ ational @-@ pe@@ eling minister : Economics lo@@ id W@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
it was often im@@ plac@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and Minister of Economics from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected by more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak for a change in economic policy on T V @-@ request at the same time .
Frank N@@ atus , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ ms ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ ther takes up the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ ing sees ne@@ atus in Infra@@ structure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands at the top of the country &apos;s pri@@ or@@ ities .
still in this year , the ministry is ho@@ ping to be planning to stand up until 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West surro@@ unds Trier , which is in the urg@@ ent request of the Bundes@@ sho@@ wer@@ ing schedule .
the aim is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , says spokes@@ person for Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
N@@ atus sees a sign to support regional , but internationally comp@@ eting company .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( CC@@ I ) is exc@@ ited to increase in the wine an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase the revenues in super@@ markets and to stop the trend of the growing German wine exports since ten years .
I also have an open ear for people who would like to establish an own company .
the Trier Chamber of the Trier sees an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to young tra@@ inees , says Managing Director Matthias Schw@@ alb@@ ach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the master crafts@@ man and 2500 Euro when gradu@@ ates within ten years after the championship training .
but the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
the scheduled road building will be able to quickly create facts , at the same time , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , main business leader of the I@@ HK Trier will be lack@@ ing .
at the age of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ dom still wants to set mobility , so far only 29 jobs are busy .
the I@@ HK calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
in 2017 , CD@@ U @-@ fr@@ act@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the invoice , the country invested more than € 20 million less in receipt of state roads as early as 2017 .
Frank N@@ atus is also a concept of the country , as it wants to raise the specialist in the region .
har@@ ass@@ ing be the former broad@@ band building in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the supply of power in an I@@ HK survey only with a touch of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ pil@@ ing connections and br@@ od@@ ours .
in contrast , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the super@@ visory board of wind energy company Pro Wind .

Audi should change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - auto producer con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter@@ balance .
one day prior to the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software into more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles .
the BMW air@@ woman said that &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; there is more intelligent options as a restri@@ ctions , &quot; and it is based on European cities - including Munich where BMW is based on the diesel vehicles or to limit the diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
the companies described as a rec@@ all of the companies .
European auto manufacturer have strongly encour@@ aged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ it diesel engines , apply as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and as@@ thma can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , plants for neutr@@ alis@@ ing of diesel vehicles allowing to install exhaust gases also , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ign@@ ore the mighty car firms and ign@@ ore signs of the problem .
the company try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices to regul@@ ate the regulations if a car was tested but under normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former director of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Audi in Germany .
the former managers , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from being delivered in the United States .
in early this year , Audi was settled in German criminal investig@@ ations in Volkswagen after the authorities decided to circum@@ vent a system in order to re@@ loc@@ ate the regulations of emissions in Europe , and an inquiry based on the United States has been extended .
the incl@@ usion of Audi into the study could be heavy for Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer transm@@ its the gain of Volkswagen from the Volkswagen .

Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish Im@@ mig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he took among others as a dra@@ fts@@ man for happiness , which was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the end of the 60 &apos;s break@@ through : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
and again the artist was inspired by the cities of cities .

lav@@ ender From the Climate Change from Climate Change
it became a symbol of Provence in southern France but there &apos;s a warning that he is threat@@ ened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is rec@@ ur@@ red because of dro@@ ught in dro@@ ught and because of the diseases of the in@@ sec@@ ts in@@ sec@@ ts , which scientists and farmers seek to find solutions , large head@@ ache etc .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agr@@ arian Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively end@@ ang@@ ered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in spring much less rain and in autumn much more .
this has an effect on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small t@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwer@@ g@@ z@@ ik@@ thread survi@@ ves , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and it is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only applied for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and lack of missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts of essential oil . &quot;
regarding the solutions that are considered in cargo include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also spray the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of s@@ orts , which are resistant to dry .

the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of journalists enter@@ tain@@ eth the growing thre@@ at in Mexico
the staff of the weekly giant of Fe@@ odo@@ ce will normally meet on Wedn@@ esdays about the latest chaos in the State Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , cor@@ set offici@@ als and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of her own trag@@ edy they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two senior journalists discuss what you feel saf@@ er : they shall take their children to the office , which were the aim of an attack of aggres@@ sion in 2009 , or let them leave at home .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
they ask re@@ porter , name for each column - no evidence is needed , per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal feel .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , polit@@ icians , business people , journalists who are susp@@ ected of being damaged by the government or the map , a catalogue of cri@@ min@@ als , which do the chaos of Mexico .
there is no rest from the violence , and throughout the country the bodies were more common : at least 25 years since the President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto had been in office in December 2012 , and by now there were at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter , their publ@@ ishers and their in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live and journalist in Mexico , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in any of his many books on violence in connection with drugs .
his absence is deeply impressed - even though his presence is present - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the faç@@ ade of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , apply T @-@ shirts which will be his sm@@ iling face with glasses or its typical pan@@ am@@ ale .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter discuss about their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 , a Son@@ der Bundes@@ an@@ walt@@ z was established in order to ren@@ ame the cases of journalists , which led to the protection of journalists to the protection of journalists only two pen@@ al procedures .
as for most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , each year with drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king and organised crime , the mur@@ derer shall be prosec@@ uted of only rarely .
in Fe@@ odo@@ ce they still exist , to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are inno@@ cent , even though the terrain is still sl@@ anted .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting of discuss@@ ing security is somewhat benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stu@@ pid , my time to turn , &quot; says he says .
&quot; as long as we know not the reason why we know all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the City of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced from two men , and was shot to him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which was translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ f@@ th river . &quot;
the cont@@ actors went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is virtually nothing as silence .
last year since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in January and the extra@@ dition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ent fr@@ actions occurred here to fill the vacuum .
it does not make that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone or several people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of ornam@@ ents , two @-@ story pul@@ p een for drug must be greater than many houses for the Living .
forget about a minute , there is a state of &quot; tranqu@@ ility , &quot; if only a chair has the control over the Kü@@ st@@ enst@@ a@@ at with its precious ports and drugs trading in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dang@@ ers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Fe@@ odo@@ ce that he was not as@@ cri@@ bed to protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of an interview recorded with a gar@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ ent cardboard fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have er@@ u@@ cle@@ ated the children , probably the band had delivered each copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was in C@@ dez , not to force ma@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a different newspaper , which had released the same story to leave the country to his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad ; and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survi@@ ves that his friends and colleagues would show that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , engaged in five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without cr@@ ying on the smo@@ po@@ ison problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time the newspaper earned a reputation for the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ est reporting , and the revenue and advertising revenue .
re@@ por@@ ters loved it to publish hard tre@@ ating survey@@ s without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the reader were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could not dare to handle anything else .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the prosec@@ ution of Mexican drugs , wher@@ ever they were .
he gave himself up volun@@ tar@@ ily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to re@@ live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October .
&quot; you need to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done so many tot@@ he ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
the Ri@@ od@@ ce @-@ Team missed Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel as a har@@ bor worker was able to cur@@ se the friend , the gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher , the knew how to survive .
you tru@@ sted on his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ abo , the Bar from the office and always sit there at the same table .
let us ask her : was his love for routine his ver@@ bs ?
his death has also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions , how they work best in their work and live on life .
&quot; they don &apos;t like to move with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their homes , and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells , stay away .
the off@@ ender was , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be dece@@ ived ... and then is the thing happening with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other countries , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative gro@@ oves , weak institutions and corrupt government offici@@ als at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the space where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce came to the security training , no mobile phones were allowed . days ago previously announced that Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor Journ@@ alists and activ@@ ists in Mexico .
there were two polic@@ emen from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Fe@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a center of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in a joke , some of the re@@ porter asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen as not tru@@ sted by himself .
it is months ago , since the re@@ porter has gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug de fac@@ to are fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has bun@@ dl@@ ed on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of the brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Ch@@ av@@ ez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they had also an exc@@ it@@ é to the state spending that concentr@@ ates on the h@@ omet@@ own of Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block away from the office of the Public Prosecutor , an ab@@ duction .
there was no official word , who was kid@@ n@@ apped , or how it happened , so was careful when everyone in the city know that the restaurant is a favorite locally designed by drug tra@@ ders and authorities .
a re@@ porter ran from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the gover@@ ning revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , which conquered all the whole century all political levels .
several pr@@ i govern@@ ors have been accused of corru@@ ption due to corru@@ ption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the re@@ porter , about previous inc@@ idents in this restaurant , including one in which one son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went into a military attack .
only a few months ago , the reader mentioned the column by Val@@ dez , regarded as the best viewed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier , we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body keyboard .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the Val@@ dez Office has been devoted to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers that Protest@@ ants against the moral of journalists , because the employees has become something that they had never expected ; activ@@ ists in the name of the press .
in Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , a few signs came and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration for an additional journalist to the office of the government .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and offici@@ als say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
in all the country Journ@@ alists are sound more than they have written in organized prot@@ ests of &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking paths and subjects .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez went to Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
when meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to express the journalist and let them destroy them , because they said the truth .
it has been asked since it has been shared by the government because they wor@@ ried that their wo@@ unds has in@@ ju@@ red their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , the government offici@@ als and an equal society . &quot;
in his final book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that Re@@ porter has not only been killed by drug companies , but also on orders of polit@@ icians and security forces , which were under a blank@@ et .
in the past year , the media turn@@ out group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 has more than half of the attacks assigned to journalists of the police and officers .
&quot; in Mexico you die , because it would like that you are in the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously the mor@@ als have a terrible effect .
nobody th@@ ats the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern borders of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am with my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones beside their separate head .
some branches have chosen to include , like El Nor@@ te in the northern borders of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of the correspon@@ d@@ ents MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others will continue to do like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez presented itself to the dr@@ umm@@ ers with a Editorial at the cover page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled from their h@@ omet@@ own countries or even out of the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
it is hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and they still watch the streets and look for dang@@ ers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as evi@@ d@@ ently by photographer Reu@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who had been murdered in a flat in Mexico City three months after escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once would be po@@ ets to be po@@ or@@ ching his drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight the last Friday , when the last edition was already termin@@ ated , the ed@@ itors of Fe@@ odo@@ ce began on the office in front of the office and d@@ rank beer than once all their tele@@ phones began to sum@@ med .
a number of sh@@ ades with band ri@@ val@@ es and security forces near the bathing place Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the br@@ andy show you have published the news on the website of Fe@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enen he@@ ul@@ ten near - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez had a look at the polic@@ emen , holding the guard to see if they were in will@@ ing@@ ness .
when they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose central finger was visible for a whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employee of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its marks .

at first sight , it looks like a statue , even a sc@@ ary .
now researchers have found that the first in@@ sights on the incredible r@@ hin@@ o ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his scal@@ y skin of red@@ dish Braun was - and they said they had had something from a &quot; un@@ peaceful past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the be@@ ster@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s which ever was found , and one of the best Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s copies of the world . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ s which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his un@@ belie@@ vable good preserved state is expl@@ or@@ er that describe it as a &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio when he was held on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something of the surrounding rock was missing on the plat@@ ze , and decided to look at more precise .
the fossil , which was discovered by him , was sent into the Royal Tyr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal on the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy cold r@@ ump .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you tw@@ inkle only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyr@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is to be seen .
&quot; it will be one of the most beautiful and most preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s spec@@ im@@ ens - Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
re@@ sear@@ cher have found that this plant n@@ iv@@ ore is covered , even though with a arm@@ or , res@@ em@@ bles the bre@@ ast@@ plate , probably threat@@ ened by meat and acc@@ us din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ouflage used to hide themselves ahead of pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shield technology that is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix into its surroundings , and by its enemies , say experts , which suggest@@ s that it was threat@@ ened by bigger din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ aur@@ s has first made head@@ lines in May and is now being shown in the Royal Ty@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and sold it to Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ .@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preser@@ vation of the copies enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , patterns and the form of shed and arm@@ or of his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ady , a widespread defense of defence in animal kingdom , signif@@ ying that the top of the cre@@ ature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ady is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta grew by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of sufficient pressure through meat dev@@ out Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , the evolution of con@@ front@@ ation of con@@ front@@ ation was benef@@ ici@@ ently benef@@ ited as a means of survival .
but most of contemporary animals that use the sh@@ aded ch@@ at@@ ching - think of de@@ er , Ze@@ br@@ as or ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and viol@@ ation than pre@@ y that this No@@ dos@@ aur@@ s was exposed to a true fight for survival .
&quot; a powerful rob@@ bing behaviour on a massive , strongly stu@@ ffed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been the cra@@ ving time , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ gets rot@@ brown was .
scientists are still searching the animal on crit@@ ics , including his conserv@@ ative gut hal@@ f@@ way to find out what it has eaten as his final meal .
they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , when he died , sank into a river and sank into the sea where it sank to the sea floor .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ oral today , and rivers and oc@@ eans spread much further in@@ ward than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ aur@@ s is really remarkable because it remains completely covered with conserv@@ ative skin , but also in three dimensions remains preserved and preserved the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly like in the early circles .
you don &apos;t need to use lots of imag@@ ination to renov@@ ate it . if you like a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the creation time was a time when giant Ther@@ op@@ o@@ des , car@@ n@@ iv@@ ores Din@@ os@@ aur@@ riere , crossed on two legs , the earth crossed through .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ os@@ aurus Rex , million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the company had driven din@@ os@@ aur@@ s from some of his ter@@ rif@@ ying ancest@@ ors .
the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ aurus belongs to a 38 @-@ foot ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons heavy mon@@ sters .
the scientists whose most recent findings appear in current biology , believe Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ ified in the mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Radio as he was held in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum it is the be@@ zz@@ led din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the Schn@@ au@@ ze until h@@ ips .
the cre@@ atures have an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ikes , which rag@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant flows through the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the under@@ water cap@@ tion of the Din@@ os@@ aur survived its arm@@ our in an exquisite detail .
the Pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special edition are so good that the skin remains still cover the cr@@ ater tank along the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ vation is so rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more dist@@ orted .
pir@@ ate remains of the skin still cover the du@@ bi@@ b tanks that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
his upright fo@@ ref@@ oo@@ t is at its side , his five fingers spread to the above .
I can count the shed at his sole &apos; .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many in@@ ju@@ red
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : barely 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ bearing line .
there are numerous final , kilomet@@ re St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) in the late Thursday afternoon , 20 people were in@@ ju@@ red in the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first information of the police were at 17.00 in between the entran@@ ces Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm , nearly 30 vehicles , including cars , including lor@@ ries , attacked .
above the exact number of the last lines , no data were reported .
it is about light to medium in@@ jur@@ ies , said a police officer .
a great sur@@ render to rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was completely blocked in Munich .
in travel from Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re long beach was formed .
as an AZ re@@ porter , it was also reported on the counter to massive dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched the signs of the vehicle &apos;s de@@ fle@@ ction , which now have to count with sensitive pen@@ al@@ ties .
shortly after 18 : 45 am then another second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
thereby it was come to a coll@@ ision between a car sports and a passenger car .
a helicopter helicopter was on the way towards the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced even has : nothing can be sitting on the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a great thoughts .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
even the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes up an un@@ soft or stopp@@ eth the ride in the middle of the workflow .
bike check control .
but the times of interru@@ p@@ tions are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the contro@@ ver@@ less bicycle control .
it is simply by phone allowing users to take his place and evalu@@ ate the ticket .
currently , a test company runs on two routes .
&quot; the offer is available , wide and wide .
it is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote traffic routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway @-@ speaker .
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the train of the ticket analysis without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use this , you need to meet some requirements : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and one must have booked an online ticket - what do you have to do most passengers .
it must also be purchased via the rail , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot;
in the review , a button for electronic determination will then appear .
the accompanying person on their mobile devices have a notification that passenger car is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y .
when a ticket control is done in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already fixed online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two benefits : one for the customers , one for rail - which is to use the passengers .
&quot; who relax@@ es without ticket inspection through our access personnel , check out in the DB Navigator basic yourself .
this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ traffic .
second plus : &quot; and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual needs of your needs . &quot;
those who frequently proce@@ eds , know that beside the del@@ ays and missed trains guide the map controls are among the biggest sleeves .
because often in any case , one of the passengers do not have all documents which you need to valid@@ ate online tickets .
either the credit card or a identity card is missing or otherwise a document that you have to prove .
the result are endless discussion between mig@@ rat@@ ors and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the down@@ side or large space and del@@ ays at the end of their own tickets and the workers at the end takes care of taking other concerns .
you can only use a small number of test customers the new service .
and that is only consider@@ ing the connections ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
more access numbers on the same circuit are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist concluded that the answer to the question is : &quot; Wh@@ ose qu@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken by her core .
just one day after being arrived in New York City , he sat in St. Louis , born on the bed of a air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat , who rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post of som@@ eb@@ ody from High School .
&quot; the police killed just a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and there is still on the street , called it there .
conf@@ used because nobody had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continually captured on her tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he post@@ pon@@ ed a picture of bro@@ wns that was stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought at him .
but death for her and community was nothing new .
she laid her cell phone , in order to return to the Can@@ field Drive in the evening via people on the evening .
there were photos of the police and people that cried out , and by a man who claimed , who claimed a shield with the wording : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of prot@@ esters with a rebel@@ li@@ ous dog .
in another video , she said , super@@ vised another polic@@ eman , and cried , saying , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remember@@ ed its testimony .
&quot; that is not the kind of murder , which we are acc@@ ust@@ om@@ ed to us and we can name it typical . &quot;
at that moment I felt swe@@ ets .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on in the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary cinema , &quot; Wh@@ ose qu@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ em@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survi@@ ving and the loss , the strength and loss of resistance , strength and resistance , which consists in fel@@ lowship of mankind who live in fel@@ lowship and might want to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel with her daughter , who wor@@ e a flower dress and a suitable crown , wor@@ e the two a conversation , that they had numerous times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for that in what they believe ? &quot; she rem@@ ind@@ ed of what she said .
&quot; we go now to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
I could not take them away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you must know it and they can see it .
it must be well designed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black const@@ itution and what we must do to free ourselves .
even if I have been lucky to give you an experience while they do not experience a de@@ lat@@ ex rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep it away . &quot;
the first stop , when she was in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities , which was promoted to a campus , as the activ@@ ists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there am far to Fer@@ rell and their daughter with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to transfer them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for fer@@ mentation .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Miss@@ ouri @-@ St. Louis , President of the Stud@@ ents Student @-@ St. Louis , based on ess@@ ences of justice and health freedom in black municip@@ alities .
&quot; I had no experience in the organisation .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
weeks later we met Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted only to document , &quot; what happened .
a question got Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
these ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism has been nour@@ ished by count@@ less cases of people , often of women - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who have been born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and have grown up their voices , and we wanted to do it . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artist from the area that has been known for its activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt ins@@ ur@@ ances .
his commitment brought the project to the project , together with six other n@@ atives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose qu@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns .
&quot; this documentary is no one who speaks for us or talk to us . we say &quot; said Davis .
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are depic@@ ted , as I will be depic@@ ted . &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; not for a Messi@@ ah leader but to come together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - they proved to be the revealed participants in the film .
as a result , they show documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose qu@@ ets ? &quot; surprising personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life as she married and married her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understood that in this work and for the creation of black people must give a certain injury . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls has repeated the role of the black we@@ ars women in the bro@@ ader Black @-@ L@@ ives movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of movement , who formed the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identified two of the three fo@@ unders of the black teen@@ agers in 2012 .
&quot; black , g@@ ay women in leadership positions have borne the movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling to different fron@@ ts .
black , g@@ ay women must bear the main last of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement truly is kept in black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it exists that &quot; this is not aff@@ ir@@ dest kind of action , &quot; at the distance because of its identity as the heart of the movie was selected .
&quot; she was the person who ro@@ ared this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no co@@ inc@@ idence , although they had an front front because with a life on these cr@@ ises as a black , g@@ ay woman says so much on the game .
you can feel their energy by the screen . &quot;
the news show in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has long since disappeared , but the rac@@ ial connections between the community and the police are still ongoing .
Fer@@ rell provides for 2 ½ years because of the block of a motorway with a demonstration .
it describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she cl@@ oned to a song and she feels committed to this memory since three years ago it was on the street in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; magn@@ itude &quot; : TV reader discuss about bit gallery
bit Gallery moves the people , although they are not yet built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an zone has since the first presentation of 2009 the population in prop@@ on@@ ents and oppon@@ ents .
cold the theme is hardly any one .
this topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
during the one to the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; Das would be real @-@ class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , coming from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or completely simple : &quot; size del@@ ight ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the prop@@ on@@ ents rests upon it , a gallery of more customers are moving in the city , from which the other transactions may benefit , fear the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an zone .
added : the gallery will be displayed right on the grounds , on which the market hall stands , in the 13 direct selling of their products .
the start of the construction will be concluded .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integr@@ ate a market hall in the new building - namely the Bed@@ a square with the possibility to sitting outside sitting .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious p@@ ie of the farmers always liked very much .
we also have discovered the but@@ cher for us .
we would like that , during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; moves to the market at a market hall in the gallery , on the amount of rent .
but it should probably not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what shopping sc@@ rap@@ ed in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , dr@@ aught , or super@@ markets : I find it un@@ necessary .
there are already enough in our city .
one sees how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
but since there is not even a proper weekly market , it is so important that at least the market hall will remain .
after all the commod@@ ity product is fresh , mostly is offered directly from the producer and is pu@@ rely cheap .
as you see , stores are rented in a shopping centre only of larger companies , because the r@@ ents are often not portable for a single tra@@ der .
too bad , special stores are almost no more and what still remains , then will probably clear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall fits me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all , where should the farmers market stand during the building time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in duration if the bit gallery is actually some@@ time .
or does it have to distri@@ bute the g@@ hosts bit gallery before , to distri@@ bute all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s simply not working .
and a shopping center that is empty , there is no one needed .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market rather than this gallery .
but for a pe@@ as@@ ant market there is no space thanks to the mad many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the farmers market is carried out , a piece of culture will dis@@ appear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ ar@@ ity : artist creates portra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown which are almost invisible - the cables are hung on the ceiling .
the 30 portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ victims and sh@@ ank , created by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st had a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison after they open@@ ly made dipl@@ omatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ ar@@ ity ) .
it is the product of two years correspon@@ dent between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipl@@ ine agreed their expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ formers and a pion@@ e@@ ering dis@@ sid@@ ents that he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extrac@@ ted by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could be extrac@@ ted by m@@ anning , and some intel@@ lec@@ tual comment not only too the form of DNA @-@ data - the many wise men as it can be interpre@@ ted and the inher@@ ent Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , was already spoken to the identification as woman , was convic@@ ted for 20 acc@@ us@@ ations , including six charges against sp@@ y , computer and the@@ ft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so it was only one single photo gave - a gra@@ dient , black and white Sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting on a driver seat in which M@@ anning has been sitting and a plat@@ inate blonde carries out - which it was associated .
in the year 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg returned from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; St@@ ran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist portra@@ its from fore@@ ign@@ ers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like c@@ ig@@ ar and che@@ wing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste extrac@@ ted , such as these people could look like .
this was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; you led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and she wanted a sort of portrait to ac@@ company this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t be visited at this time , and couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her im@@ pris@@ oned M@@ use became un@@ equal wal@@ let , which ex@@ changed several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ume Images &quot; from a Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ume Images , &quot; which would be pron@@ oun@@ ced in the future , in which the President of Chel@@ en@@ ad@@ ay would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama would actually be published only a few days after the book would call for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kan@@ sas , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there &apos;s also now in the opening of the exhibition a little deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war with in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to re@@ medy that it should actually be escap@@ ed .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a given reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery described above mentioned m@@ anning with their over@@ sized sign@@ atures ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic shred@@ der , whose basis sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written by thousands of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has ho@@ ped to show the incl@@ usion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , like amazing , at least in biological ways we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully be taken to see , who we are not concerned , who we are and like open@@ ly genetic data for interpre@@ ting and how sub@@ jec@@ tively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Spur@@ ious Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA @-@ data can tell as many different stories , so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an own room is a side from the mentioned com@@ ic @-@ no@@ elle .
she shows M@@ anning , as she emerg@@ es from the Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ist attacks in the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they keep your speech , they have won &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so you never halt the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote me , &quot; said the artist , gre@@ et it from Philadelphia .
&quot; I &apos;m always g@@ ate@@ ful if I speak about it . &quot;
M@@ anning has not yet seen the exhibition - as expected in the com@@ ic book was taken away - but when they were gre@@ eted , they will be gre@@ eted by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulations , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulations , as hor@@ des of prot@@ est@@ ing .
that was target@@ ed as everything in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings st@@ ature ) where their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of people , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portra@@ its .
&quot; I wanted to feel that it feels like a mass movement which formed with Chelsea as the movement , which was also called behind their liberation . &quot;

the management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the vic@@ tim , and explo@@ res a variety of mot@@ ifs , including a possible domestic advantage . &quot;
&quot; we will conclu@@ de the WA@@ DA schedule in the near future &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister of Mut@@ ko
Russian vice @-@ Deputy Prime Minister , Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko , will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will continue to restore the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fil@@ ment the criteria of schedule , Rus@@ ada has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
the WA@@ DA schedule has been updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM comm@@ ented on the second part of the WA@@ DA to compliance with the code which describes the criteria for recovery of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing to deal with Russia &apos;s cause .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , demonstr@@ ate the results of Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing authorities in the study by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleg@@ ed state sub@@ si@@ dy d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports publicly accept .
regarding the matter of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation , as our anti @-@ Dop@@ ing system poss@@ esses an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not add something what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sal@@ ary R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeated that the report contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al positions and rules .
no one has to accept these report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
Rus@@ ada was elim@@ inated in November 2015 as part of the Dop@@ ing Sc@@ and@@ als of the WA@@ DA by the execution of d@@ oping controls in Russia .
however , her was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier N@@ ig@@ gli declared that Rus@@ ada moved in the right direction &quot; to be deployed again .

the Start U@@ ps that will help your company to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett would not want to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce Start @-@ up but survey@@ s did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - still worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ously .
and even when you acknowle@@ dged an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers didn &apos;t dare to do this process .
&quot; there was simply never consist@@ ency and objec@@ tiveness , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their staff feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software that has to provide the specific purpose of the employee of employees , it allows businesses to provide various groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow us to implement the C @-@ Suite Lead@@ ership Team and turn right to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persec@@ ution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up Gl@@ int , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees .
revi@@ ve said they have a better in@@ sight into what your staff think and feel in the three years with Gl@@ int won .
in addition to the Snap @-@ Pol@@ ls and pol@@ ls of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which indicates most complaints , and which managers can have low state results - so that you can re@@ boot up why .
company come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , that you have not been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which has been published in sc@@ and@@ als , which has been published in sc@@ and@@ als , who have spoken a Blog @-@ Post in which those who have spoken , have been pun@@ ished .
for start ups like Gl@@ int , this wish is a fun business opportunities for an overview .
the global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance sector will have more than $ 118@@ ,@@ 7 billion worth , according to the funded website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad conduct , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sc@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
he has recently signed as a client .
as Gl@@ int , Conver@@ cent Company lets you submit person@@ alized &quot; pulse &quot; survey@@ s , collect tru@@ sted responses in real time and view the warm@@ th cards of your problem .
it also offers anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which can be reported in bad conduct .
and if the principal leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion about the Reg@@ ul@@ ators &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or im@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience cost@@ ly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ c@@ ott , worker c@@ tu@@ ation and fl@@ ames , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ tible has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previous when an employee wants to report a problem , he had to find or her a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an assessment and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said it gave no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ cent is able to mig@@ rate problems that were h@@ iding in offices in cities or states that were identified - like dis@@ cri@@ mination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ til@@ ed inter@@ ns .
&quot; I can go closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience working with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es and Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es . &quot;
the company began to appo@@ int Eth@@ ics , values and collabor@@ ative commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen due to eth@@ ical viol@@ ations of the En@@ ron sc@@ and@@ al , Quin@@ lan .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; The company realized that you could not prevent dirty laundry .
&quot; before using technology for monitoring eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Gl@@ int as well Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and loads the company with rec@@ ur@@ ring charges for using their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the consent of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors that have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million from the financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
over $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners has secured its total financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there are a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff expect from their jobs more than so far .
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the staff int@@ ends to have you accepted and appreci@@ ated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if the people are happy to be in a company , and the work that you will do is worth@@ while , then said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , who used both Conver@@ cent and Gl@@ int .
investors att@@ ends its portfolio if its portfolio is well run . it run well , when employees are working and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics Tools raised third parties , commitment and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you can find support .
the data on employee commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the Administrator does not take any measures .
in fact when a company asks people after your feedback , there may have a expect@@ ation that change on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or even at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees can be motiv@@ ate .
&quot; if you ask any 4.000 suggest@@ ions , you must be ready to have 4.000 con@@ vers@@ ations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company K@@ otter International , who has not rely on the collecting of data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot;
Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly pay@@ men@@ tions , was able to include measures on the same day , when a problem is reported about Gl@@ int , rett .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organ@@ ise several teams within the company , and to add a full communications training to deal with the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday the company will always receive new in@@ sights into the staff , and ho@@ pes that on a long term , this leads to better binding of workers in a industry that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose our customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CAA remedi@@ es two @-@ day intern@@ ships and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it comes to 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers under@@ go a page of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have crossed off their tri@@ c@@ oto@@ ber@@ ts and display the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of training camp .
this un@@ employed minutes is for a good part of the team .
players who are en@@ rolled in to the summer courses , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 a.@@ m .
&quot; that &apos;s the guys who had the next three days a real tre@@ t@@ mill &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before the Monday ended on Tuesday .
N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilit@@ ate the load of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three training sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to ful@@ fill the players already packed .
the com@@ promise away from the two days is more than a day when the bro@@ od moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times gets on West wood practical exercises .
they should hold out in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before beginning of formal playing preparations for their pre@@ lude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he add the regular changing of N@@ CAA rest , even if they add a further point to the various routes of the player .
&quot; we lay these enormous loads three or four days at them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they simply pressed them , they fell on , they are great people .
I think we will come up until Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish their intern@@ ships as soon as the camp is finished , with the clear view of its fields from a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , which has already been shel@@ tered with foot balls , which will already be a protective screen behind a goal posts that will be no slight task .
bro@@ ins players will occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a cle@@ ared that it could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will be deplo@@ ying our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; it &apos;s a real problem , and it is not far to think that people would rent a room there and then set there to record a practice .
if you have the video wall from an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I don &apos;t think so much to great wor@@ r@@ ying .
we have a plan . &quot;

creating a Com@@ ic @-@ ROM : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 @-@ he years a lo@@ op@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his cosy seat in the ir@@ rig@@ ate River valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ i@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manusc@@ ript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ar@@ ly .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; surro@@ unds the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ w@@ icz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Palmer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book by Rho@@ des , based on an archive . he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s his th@@ umb print !
and Let@@ ters always sm@@ ells of smoke , because then there was fire on the light because of light .
for someone who lives more than 300 years later , the sc@@ ent has a effect , as if he himself had .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for anyone looking so with old papers , he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in one castle lived ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I just seems to be a bit too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; Castle to study the archives and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle and the bottles that had spent several centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he mig@@ rated the site and ruins of the old castle , and talked with landscapes , gar@@ den@@ ing , and sometimes with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book .
then , at night , he d@@ rank wh@@ is@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only recently received the full access as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey .
when Rho@@ des got a decade later , the staff started to wor@@ ry about the archive , which he spoke to &quot; hundreds of years , in which A@@ rist@@ oc@@ rats spoke &quot; Oh , throw it on the lo@@ ft . &quot;
di@@ apos@@ itions , letters from the time of the English emp@@ ires , maps who adm@@ ire , who would say : &quot; one could mean that rural conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families .
guys , let everything go out his ais@@ le ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection take the castle as a starting point to break on a wider basis into the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which leaves the newly built Castle to connect to the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ as@@ ant rose in this area and I thought a rebel@@ lion was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firm@@ ly root@@ ed in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which was the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher , hidden the family of Dar@@ rell during the English Re@@ formation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in whom the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century is represented by his own bur@@ ial , having filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was du@@ g out later than its coff@@ in ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ le@@ men p@@ izz@@ le g@@ aun@@ er to be , still deb@@ ts and money for things that they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men who married their young women - I got married to me as a bunch of good looking guys , with a tal@@ ent to acqu@@ ire him within . &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des on the search for other unique scri@@ be experiences
he has given a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wild for a com@@ ic @-@ novel about El@@ ong@@ ho@@ mä@@ ki to the area of a gent@@ le@@ man in the early 20th century , which has been dem@@ anded from nature again by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I must finish with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Marien@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the murder of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign for introduc@@ ing a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , may@@ or Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team would like to hold the logo and s@@ log@@ an ge@@ heim until Thursday .
at the end of August it will be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; for beautiful to us .
or ? &quot; asked the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think it ( course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday online website .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
basically , we are the fixed belief that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
with the action , it will go more than &quot; only a logo and s@@ log@@ an , it continues .
&quot; it &apos;s considered to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise , one which gives the city a unique recognition feature . &quot;
I finally understand it in the competition with other municip@@ alities .
a middle five @-@ digit amount will be the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f which will cost its new umbrella and campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
every year in Ankara , the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es over reti@@ rement and dis@@ orders in the officer level .
so this week also .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine during the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the Staff of Staff , as early as early as the office of the Prime Minister .
to the consult@@ ations , under the pre@@ sidency of the regime , the five vice prem@@ acy and the Minister for Defence , Inn@@ eres , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus civilians were in the midst of the Y@@ AS .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the host , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup it has fired the Erd@@ og@@ an Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually due to alleg@@ ed connections to the ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire of the coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
there are 486 people who are directly involved in the coup attempt at hand , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup attempt , Erd@@ og@@ an had referred to the over@@ throw as &quot; God &apos;s gift , as he give him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an have really put the army in a grip ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; H@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the Staff of the &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , the army that manif@@ ests itself in the abol@@ ition of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the big cleaner in the army and security forces is continuing .
in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an sent another 73@@ 95 heads of government agencies , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 female soldiers .
it seemed , when Erd@@ og@@ an was nar@@ rated to the military .
gener@@ als used to be the country &apos;s real gent@@ le@@ men .
three times p@@ utsch@@ es they on their role as a guard of the sec@@ ular state regime .
after his election in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pressed the power of the military to step by step , not least on appeal for the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an drivers deli@@ ber@@ ate an Islamic syn@@ thesis of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; , &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; war@@ ned not an accurate officer who searched for asylum from fear of persec@@ ution in foreign countries asylum , and the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extreme extrem@@ ists and o@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
one meets this , that the N@@ ato could not be cold .
after the pur@@ ification of the Turkish army , there is no doubt in the pur@@ ification of the Turkish army .
the ex@@ ecu@@ tives and operating skills be &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats .

before the end of the year it is due to the mar@@ o@@ des track which drives the tourist railway .
in order to secure the future of the race @-@ growing long @-@ term , according to the transport technology , construction work is scheduled to start this year .
&quot; with the decision to order and to re@@ order the distance of Ilmenau @-@ rac@@ eh@@ as , the country knows that above all for tourism , &quot; said traffic authority Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros .
in total , the country sur@@ pass 75 percent .
the contract , based on the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , will not be voted to decl@@ are .
the Ministry and the southern railway , as operator , are already in the technical details .
&quot; the timet@@ able , which are used by vehicles and standards of quality , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned agreement between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this should be ordered the race @-@ on Shuttle in December 2017 .
the rac@@ ig shuttle is primarily for tourists popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Renn@@ es .
over the past few months in the course of a pilot plant , we have been using enough many people to order it again in the future .
the track is also strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should wor@@ ry us
just as you thought that in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robot is coming .
Yes , in fact .
sex robot are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor for Robot@@ ik and artificial intelli@@ gence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we have to start taking seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of nip@@ ples and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
&quot; the people make them funny , but the company deliver a lot of it , and we will get them more likely to see , saying , Mr Shar@@ key said in the publication of his new report .
modern sex pu@@ bs have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with deli@@ ber@@ ately human reactions which can be achieved by artificial intelli@@ gence .
the user can also adjust its robot directly to his belie@@ fs , &quot; and choose from the eye @-@ color of the robot on the shape of nip@@ ples to the type or color of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there is still wor@@ r@@ ying , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; which would make a progressive woman progressive .
modern sex pu@@ bs have developed to robots with a silicone membrane .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example to adapt its robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling how rel@@ ap@@ sing .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre@@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; F@@ rigid Far@@ rah , &quot; giving the impression of &quot; F@@ rigid Far@@ rah &quot; and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an adv@@ ent@@ uro@@ us personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so , you may like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has its m@@ oo@@ ds - as real people !
she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
there are many troubled aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least , because they recogn@@ ise real human relation@@ ships , but the under@@ p@@ age@@ ous female characteristics , if one go a step on F@@ rigid ( this : resist@@ ing ) farms , per@@ ser@@ ene one of the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the website .
however , this sex robot is not just a table or just another sex player .
their emer@@ gence and increasing refin@@ ement prove something dark and dep@@ ths in our culture , on a return from the gender equality and a desire to sex with sub@@ mission to an optional addition .
most men will obviously hold no sex robot , while the FR@@ R will notice her asc@@ ending popular@@ ity , but remain temporary at the edge of consumer culture .
but what is per@@ tin@@ ent from the edge zones , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , could be very educational .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting , until they are the free market for the permission .
there is a certain di@@ vor@@ ce that this highly developed sex @-@ robot immer@@ sed in a time in which the rights of women are threat@@ ened around the world , who in the White House is a President that has g@@ ul@@ led to have sex@@ ually attacked women .
the dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn out body and the ch@@ ai@@ red eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots consists to produce a physical simil@@ ar@@ ity to actual women as realistic as techn@@ ically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their bu@@ ilder , they want themselves to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , if it comes to the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , robots do not represent real women .
they cannot be separated from their compan@@ ions or easily .
they don &apos;t have a medi@@ ation or background story , lack of independence or anything that may distur@@ b the imag@@ ination of total sub@@ mission .
you expressed different : they are pretty sl@@ aves .
or to express it in the Re@@ de@@ position of 2017 : maid services
tr@@ umps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it is become a bin@@ ocul@@ ars in the tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions have been polar@@ ized , also divided families in small formats .
around Christmas and Ern@@ est there were in the USA papers concerned with advice on how to reverse fol@@ ds with hor@@ ror of tr@@ ump .
we all supp@@ ose to re@@ ject our filter bu@@ bbles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps , families .
I chose this because my co@@ us@@ in , an left @-@ directed poet , who has lived in Chicago and has long been visiting the Republi@@ can in our family that week in New York .
it rem@@ ind@@ ed me that the unity can have a powerful enemy on a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone is familiar , including the re@@ publi@@ can relationship , with which she fought for decades because of its policy , suddenly and quite strange at the same side .
around the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this brings considerable risks to itself .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the adjust@@ ing effect of his pre@@ sidency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the char@@ ity of us that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be to@@ pped .
however , there is still a long @-@ term long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump &apos;s Re@@ public@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ al@@ izes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as ep@@ it@@ ome of exter@@ mination .
I find myself from an active nost@@ alg@@ ia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ onic version of the re@@ comp@@ ence - the dog on the Auto@@ d@@ ach , which looked at 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - which occur in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact one of very mild stra@@ ins .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Re@@ public@@ ans must be only spiritual to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my co@@ us@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the New York &apos;s park department , and the best three dollars which you can spend in the city , if there is no caffeine .
the horses are trem@@ end@@ ous large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are brigh@@ tly and the animals turn off to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extreme dark and clim@@ atic music arran@@ ges this in a strange way .
so many lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appo@@ int : the views from high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are to be familiar to offer much exc@@ it@@ ement , and the reality of the city is not righteous .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m not all over the day , when I found that Swiss Cottage is certainly not a Swiss Cottage that is not one of the topics - the topic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one of the round@@ about in the north of London .
however , central park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience since two two years old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
when I could ass@@ ess Kar@@ us@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody had asked afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before using my credit card .
in the coffee shop on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option , the evaluation by a 15 % tip of tip - this is to buy something over the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but ex@@ er@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ use gr@@ inning , while I get tired of the experience , you got my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ or@@ ius re@@ located with chest pain from prison in the hospital
Pist@@ or@@ ius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of inc@@ isions that he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ or@@ ius was convic@@ ted of an appeal against Mor@@ ning after an appeal against the government .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by calling them through a door to the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ or@@ ius said that he did his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal inv@@ ring@@ ing that hid herself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their inten@@ tion , this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ or@@ ius App@@ ell , of which they say , be op@@ aque .
the National Prosecutor of the Authority said that it would be ex@@ alted to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the contra@@ diction could be heard this year .
Pist@@ or@@ ius runs on danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no deaths in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold found a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the quad@@ ru@@ sts from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and put on secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the gram@@ mar school , four at the secondary school .
Schul@@ le@@ iter@@ an Angelika Sit@@ te welcomed parents and representatives of the public in the public house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol for the school dis@@ mis@@ sal the 29 students of four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der was a young eagle that grows in chicken , but then is released into freedom .
in addition the lower sh@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it from his ch@@ ick@@ ens .
a little eagle came out of a chicken egg .
but the hope of making him a chicken , and the eagle spread forth his wings on a high mountain , and escap@@ ed his wings .
after that the classes were three and four in the course of Y@@ vonne Frank showed a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens t@@ anz@@ es with the young go@@ cks , the cylinder carried out to w@@ ager .
the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ le@@ iter@@ at Angelika Sit@@ te .
the young was different unlike the other young animals ( Kü@@ ken ) , however .
he will never be like a chicken .
his dest@@ iny was to be free .
they wish every quad@@ ru@@ sting people that he feels accepted in his new school .
it was followed by the colleagues of the colleagues , the former director Michael Müller , who always comes up again with tuition and parents .
the co@@ ken@@ ing time now is over , explained Class m@@ igh@@ ter Sophia Schumacher .
they only leave their students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the quad@@ ru@@ sts .
at the end all students complete a song from summer time and summer time .
this broke great joy with the children .
eight initial lam@@ entation have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulgarian people arrested for Il@@ legal Camping in Greece

Software Update for Diesel Cars : what You Need To Know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission of emission of Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the licensed software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously accepted only for the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the KRA@@ FT@@ F@@ LIGHT @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customer inform about updates ?
manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the next few months , but still no precise appointment .
Daimler has commun@@ icated to at@@ tribute every female concerned .
if any inspection should be due , it will be done in their framework .
how long could the equ@@ il@@ ances move in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the app@@ endi@@ ces of the commitment of the manufacturers and from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen what volun@@ tar@@ ily take care of the car manufacturers to date so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could last for three to four hours in the workshop .
time consum@@ ing must be to receive an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will be waiting for .
pres@@ um@@ ably , foreign manufacturers would move , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE was fe@@ ars that way .
but just in the regions , where drivers threat@@ ening .
in rural areas there is no securities in older diesel so far .
the ACE will be@@ have to wait with an sale still .

we do the city vi@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ el@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to Ren@@ te in the coming year .
the place is already written - suitable candidate are however r@@ ar .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister since 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he did in the press discussion .
it reports varied , but even demanding tasks that wait for his successor .
at the same time ad@@ mi@@ res him that no application is ER@@ EL@@ LLE the required profile .
the city sear@@ ches an architect or design engineer at the closest point .
so - under the s@@ laughter of the regular notice of notice - still enough time to el@@ ab@@ oration .
since Has@@ lach was acting for the administrative community as Unter@@ e Building Authority , the applic@@ ants must be appropriate to the applic@@ ants .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they can &apos;t ref@@ ill out this , citizens would have to drive advice until Off@@ enburg .
but civil servants be important to him , says W@@ acker that reports from a good company li@@ ma as well as good spirits between the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have had to look back on the h@@ ack@@ ers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the future , varied projects are set up in the agenda : the design of the former bo@@ kl@@ a area and the low @-@ hop park can be reached .
the Kin@@ z@@ ig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still a theme .
the latter alone is sm@@ ash@@ ing with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; R@@ ack@@ ers R@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master large room .
it can be flex@@ ibly re@@ acted with Has@@ ch@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building and gar@@ dener .
&quot; one can move much , &quot; h@@ ack@@ ers , and the design of the green plants will often be im@@ posed by citizens and visitors .
since the Old Town stands as a Ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; one eye to have approved , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ izes the ex@@ empl@@ ating urban development .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility .
he is the building owner , &quot; at the end , everything runs through my table . &quot;
at his supervision and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ a@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in charge for ten years with Manfred Schön@@ er ( underground ) for 15 years .
also that his successor is long , W@@ acker says , &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to be identified and want to stay . &quot;
for continu@@ ity , not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further creation of the city .
w@@ ho@@ ever wants to sy@@ ll@@ able Roland W@@ acker , should have a degree in architecture or Bachelor with field of architecture and have a good knowledge of knowledge in the areas of construction and construction plan .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ stands high and deep construction , building planning , gro@@ und@@ work opportunities , Municipal coun@@ ten@@ sions with building farm and urban gar@@ den@@ ing as well as Unter@@ e Building Authority including monument protection .
bike to lines cast : southern railway line blocked
according to police , the previously unknown val@@ leys at the railway gli@@ ding across the Le@@ o@@ zen street ( B@@ 116 ) had thrown into the lines .
these were so heavily damaged , that the hard move had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male val@@ leys and are looking for the night hours after them .
near the crime , witnesses of a ros@@ é shaped roller and a bike riders were observed .
&quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ ich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A .
the val@@ leys also had taken themselves in great danger and also end@@ ang@@ ered by train .
besides the damage to the locomotive and the plant and the delay of rail transport , p@@ ön@@ es of rail clients could also be increased to the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors .
a total of &quot; considerable &quot; sum , &quot; said the spokes@@ man .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway service could be run on the south route without dis@@ abilities .
one day , Friday morning were un@@ attended , two of them mainly concerned correspondence .
goods , however , did not tum@@ ult , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be ex@@ changed around 200 metres of out@@ lines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( Flamm@@ able disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system as a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relie@@ ve symptoms of patients with anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel .
the imm@@ oral condition , which affects around 1.3 million in the United States , caused ma@@ sters and blo@@ ws , rec@@ ur@@ ring or blo@@ ody confusion , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those concerned , meat and dairy products normally ro@@ de to relie@@ ve their symptoms , re@@ sear@@ cher at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University , found the essential amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an of proteins to develop immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the re@@ sear@@ cher , Dr. Marco Colonna explained that Immun@@ e cells in the intest@@ inal pat@@ rol make sure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in food , do not p@@ enter into the body .
cells , dis@@ able , inflamm@@ ation are compens@@ ated by cells , promote tolerance , and protect the body without dam@@ aging the tissue .
if the balance is too far towards inflamm@@ ation , it can result in an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel .
in experiments , a kind of tolerance for the imm@@ unity was found in mice , which contri@@ bute to a particular bacter@@ ium in its bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs Tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more Tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an had the mice of their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he propos@@ es that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an rich nutrition is toler@@ ated , less anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory collap@@ ses if the same system also act with people .
the Post@@ doc@@ toral thesis Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an investig@@ ated a kind of immune system that had found a group of study sites such cells , but another group of the same tri@@ bal , but that was not separate .
it is assumed that the difference in the intest@@ inal symptoms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i who normally live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
the mice of mice were DNA sequ@@ ences and were found in six bacter@@ ial species that were present in mice with the immune cells , but lack@@ ing mice .
mice were brought up in a sterile environment , so they lack@@ ed a Dar@@ mm@@ ik@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were formed the reu@@ pt@@ i and immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria break out to the immune system , the researchers increased L. reu@@ pt@@ i in a fluid and then over@@ thre@@ w small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ rip@@ e Immun@@ e cells , which were isolated from mice .
the Immun@@ e cells developed to the tolerance eligible cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers have dou@@ bling the amount of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an in the feed of mice increased by around 50 per cent , but when the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ es were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an declared that people have the same toler@@ ant subst@@ ru@@ ction cells , such as mice , and protect most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our m@@ ages .
it is not known to develop whether tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells of people like in mice , but defects in gen@@ es in relation to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote these cells emer@@ ge on the inside surface of the intest@@ ines .
potenti@@ ally can lead high tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to a population of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot;
at Manchester United , with Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic has signed a &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impres@@ sively in the frame role as the people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Pereira in popular@@ ity .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the bl@@ ues and managed to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho since he had to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho before beginning of the Premier League 2012 season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelli@@ gence , a gen@@ ius in the nature , how he th@@ inks - he th@@ inks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready later than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u also started at the A@@ vi@@ va stadium in the A@@ vi@@ va stadium when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho will be the start of the season .
the Independent unve@@ iled during this week , that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho might wish three other new engag@@ ements but he had already shown that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; with three of his four stages of new engag@@ ements .
&quot; for three of four , thank you to the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if you have received four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;

the pilots fle@@ w Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner about the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screen was the shape of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already been such advertising .

new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
like the wind tw@@ isted : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was one of the SPD chief , in retro@@ spect , social democratic prime minister before elections were always with a certain concern to Berlin .
just no wor@@ r@@ fire from the party escape , no head@@ wind from the covenant - so was the most important wish of the choice .
since Martin Schulz has led the pro@@ found@@ ly al@@ tered .
since then the employee of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing resolution illustr@@ ate the events in the SPD @-@ ruled state cap@@ itals .
what has been given from there since the beginning of the year , with counter@@ wind not been described in the approach .
it was deep advice .
and indeed one by another .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Bun@@ des @-@ CD@@ U also sees a generic signal to Ko@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply reg@@ ate , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the ed@@ itorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
the sur@@ pris@@ ingly frac@@ tion@@ ist of a green de@@ pu@@ ties made the government of Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) to a severe crisis .
five months before the mountain pole , its red @-@ green co@@ alition took their votes to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ President Michael K@@ ell@@ ner challeng@@ ed the ab@@ tr@@ usive Dutch nationality El@@ ke T@@ ows to withdraw his mand@@ ate .
the re@@ sign@@ ation of the CD@@ U means a clear elim@@ ination of vot@@ ers .
El@@ ke T@@ thwest must immediately return to her mand@@ ate , &quot; said the Federal Finance and Choice of the Gre@@ ens of the Green ed@@ itorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; it may not be true all true , &quot; she sigh@@ ed as the Friday morning , as Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ an@@ hood reaches the party headquarters .
Stephan We@@ il , SPD Minister President of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U green de@@ fle@@ ets of the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the provis@@ ional cli@@ max of a whole rows of large and small cr@@ ises in SPD @-@ fac@@ tories .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expected defeat at the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
a blue eye , no longer , re@@ ass@@ uring the com@@ ra@@ ins at a time .
according to the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this then became - and indeed everything was much worse .
the SPD in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ be , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite carried out the party smooth .
the com@@ ra@@ yed the com@@ ra@@ des in the weeks afterwards .
then when they had sh@@ amed up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and the next deep came with him .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus in the weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burnt .
and because in the crisis @-@ communication well done anything wrong , which one can make wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan We@@ il .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board of Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on prime minister has been in the critic@@ ism since longer .
ob@@ ese conversion values came in .
anyway , or maybe in the past few weeks , We@@ il tried to get stronger in the covenant of acc@@ ents .
the tax@@ ation of the former may@@ or from Hannover to building his power in Berlin was not conce@@ aled by Martin Schulz as well .
they left him as they promised by past@@ il a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
there is no gu@@ ilt of the lower Sax@@ on nature in the grave of the lower internal for@@ ums .
and Schulz are not at all .
while the com@@ ra@@ ises dec@@ ides , the com@@ ra@@ des shif@@ ts to keep its own ranks .
your wrath is based on the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the lower@@ ed par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arian super@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democracy dig@@ ression regarding the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party collap@@ ses in the SPD parliamentary group , the ed@@ itorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ rucks is not elected for its person as a direct can@@ ter , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Parliament , so the sax@@ onian de@@ pu@@ ties are continuing .
the logical consequ@@ ence would be that she returns to her mand@@ ate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ ers of four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan We@@ il to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as the tip of the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND .
&quot; now , the personal career of CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties hit the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he ordered to clar@@ ify the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if more has been or has been passed on to the CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
sponsors for the Ort@@ ler@@ s III
those who want to be re@@ paired in the years can be for@@ warded by the country .
in this inform@@ al Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EC urban development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review to the date .
it has been in Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e areas since 1991 .
at that time , in the rehab@@ il@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg has been taken over two @-@ thir@@ ds of the funding amount .
in the rehab@@ il@@ itation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the sub@@ si@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the hi@@ ther@@ to the hi@@ ther@@ to renovation project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the inner development , and not only new building areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from the ruling class Karlsruhe that it will give a renovation area of III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rema@@ inder of the commun@@ e of Emp@@ fingen .
how is there a rehab@@ il@@ itation solution ?
you will find so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , to investig@@ ate where the &quot; really old houses are .
but it plays a role whether in the planned area there are interest of existing , to be rehab@@ ilit@@ ated .
if necessary , the area should be shif@@ ted again .
the ST@@ EC Treaty on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presents the contents of the federal state programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose framework the renov@@ ations would then be performed .
the core of the program are the vit@@ alis@@ ing of interior cap@@ itals , improving the living and working conditions and maint@@ aining the infrastructure .
the measures are based on objects , which means for each plot .
then the rehab@@ il@@ itation zone finally would eventually set as a stat@@ utes .
the author@@ isation period for funding has been running since 1st January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
until September of this year , only once again the inventory would be carried out , under those who are involved in the rehab@@ il@@ itation areas involved a quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire .
in November or December , the stat@@ utes should be made to begin next year with the renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that each commun@@ e could perform the accused of investig@@ ations .
it is therefore to rate the urban abuse and to decide when it is rehab@@ ilit@@ ated and in which scope .
for the respective plot a sanitary facility will also be entered in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to Emp@@ fingen and get a picture of the situation , promised them .
Got@@ zel st@@ ressed , a major success factor for the project was the participation of the parties involved .
therefore , there will be a quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aires , which can be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire is the &quot; building and building of the building , with which it goes among others by construc@@ tional condition and refurb@@ ishment .
the grey quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , can be done according to size , division , and residents of a room .
the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled when the building areas are operated .
however , Got@@ zel denied it , that a full quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new construction works are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler st@@ ressed that the distribution of convey@@ ors according to the &quot; Wind@@ und principle &quot; functional - who first comes , war@@ ns first .
they could not be booked a promot@@ er for later . &quot;
in the end there were still photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ ler@@ ern II &quot; to make the reason a refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
British inv@@ entor see itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand motion in the house and by car
a British inv@@ entor is the first in the country which is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his own door , his office and even with a hand motion his car can start .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between th@@ um@@ bs and Ze@@ i@@ spot@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who wish to simp@@ lif@@ y their lives by the company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has merged with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a advis@@ able an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ists at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , Han@@ ts , merged to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology res@@ em@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am will also want to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one now has both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the promotional fees of the White House cost thousands
the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event which highlights US production during the last month , tax pay@@ ers according to the TIME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President on board was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and introduc@@ tory Be@@ am@@ te des White House made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter shown in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a For@@ k@@ lift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House required the presence of the helicopter type or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before helicopter on the South La@@ wn , after the recording of the Navy Hel@@ icopter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter type .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of that , because it is an unusual event with high vis@@ ibility , &quot; wrote the Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his pre@@ set , the vice @-@ president of Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 and so long until the la@@ wn was ev@@ acu@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
NOTE : add that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , as due to the restri@@ ction of service hours a second crew would be required for return flight .
the original flight of flight was during the event during the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained at the ground during the time .
from the index provided by the TIME , it was not clear that a second aircraft was ultim@@ ately required .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its the federal government to use public ownership for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question we asked if it was about a viol@@ ation of Brands Hatch and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander .
&quot; sounds as if you &apos;re closed , &quot; answered the Deputy Command@@ ant .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by Brands Hatch .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
on the event , the President gave a c@@ lash to reform of health reform that was in the Senate , and he pro@@ pag@@ ated efforts to ass@@ ume government regulations .
the use of the air@@ plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phen@@ omen@@ on .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo operation is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation in February , when the Pre@@ sidential aircraft was present in the background of his first Camp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the Pre@@ sidential aircraft through its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries , which are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn through to dep@@ end the US President in the White House with precise timet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was the training requirements of the airline issued for the month , said a by@@ ter .
hel@@ oc@@ op@@ ter units also fle@@ w 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ pre@@ sidential au@@ ctions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers have no greater than the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky told that the company had not been involved with the hel@@ icop@@ ters for the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for pre@@ sidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D exam rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
record of the unity recorded the flight time of air@@ plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gu@@ ed that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the author@@ ization rates , is highly ac@@ re@@ leader , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual resources . &quot;
according to a RAN@@ D study from 2015 , the exam fee for Do@@ D is not included , but also account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time the former press releases of the White House , Sean Sp@@ icer , the help of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week of things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ icer . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contri@@ bute to our national security , and I ass@@ ume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent upon them .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment to have worked as many Americans .
it is of course reasonable to highlight . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ act with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire station .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump talked to his representatives from S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ z@@ te with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ ck@@ les
the world leaders of the Second tennis division enters the SV @-@ dor@@ f@@ er SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow at 11 : 00 in Kiel , with the Advanced Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite the five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable balance , the world leaders of the Second tennis division won the sense to reality .
team Chef Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that is still playing in quite similar formation .
just on the back position I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , import@@ antly , import@@ ing from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point on inser@@ ts in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Peder@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ erre@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; that is difficult for us as always .
you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could be Max . Jan@@ vier .
currently it is currently in the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella actual Fr@@ ench@@ man not to the league game , which at the tournament in Czech Li@@ bere@@ c played Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at his first use in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated chil@@ ren Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White Mu@@ il@@ ev@@ ski , at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ball .
but in Kiel he should be like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ el@@ p , Niels Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could re @-@ place .
if one is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was one of the Junior World R@@ ugs in January 2016 , someone from the train@@ ee arri@@ ves around Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay .
how America can harm the OMV
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump did not really happy when he made his signature by law on the sub@@ mission of the sanc@@ tions against Russia .
&quot; in his H@@ ast , the law came to er@@ ect , &quot; the congress gave a few &quot; const@@ itutional regulations . &quot; he was un@@ packed .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and in Brussels also fo@@ amed of US forces .
after all , the draft propos@@ es to acceler@@ ate European companies to help Rus@@ sians , gas pip@@ el@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors of the local network are qui@@ et@@ ly al@@ armed together with other European firms which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic company Nord Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is trem@@ end@@ ous .
however , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , as the official statement of the oil concerts .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanc@@ tions even via Executive Order for life .
twelve weapons are standing with him for election .
&quot; the press &quot; has been viewed to we@@ ep the Group and could really we@@ ep for him .
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cartel is the center of the hit by Net@@ fli@@ x .

back in the back@@ ward : the town pos@@ es 46 kitchen hil@@ ly
the city organ@@ izes the K@@ ita lunch once again .
with firm response partners for the children and an assignment of the team .
in the urban children &apos;s day the clock will be turned back .
on the 1st of September , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply to the city &apos;s urban training facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of Art Research , is a good news : &quot; we all pleased all of us . &quot;
there is still cooked besides the house : a c@@ ater@@ er takes over this task and delivers fresh bo@@ iled ch@@ illed .
the city operates in the area of 46 children , in 44 , the children will get a warm meal in 44 .
in the past year , 2800 children each sat in tables , and the need is growing ste@@ adily .
&quot; I have not only eating kids to take care of 45 weekly lessons , in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children until 14 pm remain . &quot;
46 Par@@ tial artists from 1st September kitchen : they warming up food , comp@@ lement the meal , comp@@ lement your meal , give food out , clean food , cleaning and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firm@@ ly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two kinds of group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ group@@ ed facilities - dec@@ ides over the hour .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now fixed to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; so they are much more inten@@ tionally integrated and it is easier to implement , ped@@ agog@@ ical and educational concepts . &quot;
for this is why it concerns : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the coastal force should be mean@@ ing@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity be important for the children .
the m@@ amm@@ als of K@@ ita @-@ rooms - hi@@ ther@@ to the task of kit@@ es - so far is done by the Special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , also has the charm of the cost between capital and foreign contrac@@ tors , it is the most economic and is called to the press .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; but that hours fall for around 750 people in the education area is not as strong in weight , &quot; says Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Af@@ gh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can be only representative when all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , director of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women in the provinces can escape to the provinces . three women can escape the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered vot@@ ers .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in one statement .
elections can only be Re@@ present@@ ative and cre@@ di@@ ble , if women are un@@ restricted and included in all parts of your choice process .
Afghanistan elections for the Provinc@@ ial and Pre@@ sidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Tal@@ ib@@ an have issued thre@@ ats against a election process that inter@@ act with transition from international combat hand@@ outs to an advis@@ ory role .
this year elections for the first time the power will become peaceful from a democr@@ atically elected Government to the next .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women is still inten@@ si@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Af@@ gh@@ an independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by a total of 3.6 million vot@@ ers .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to become a union with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has out@@ we@@ igh more than the future of investments in the Toll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work at work , which was produced in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adis said that over the last few years he invested more than 5 million pounds .
he added that employees and trade union represented &quot; as the first &quot; would , if their activities would change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to express that the financing for modern@@ ization of production lines are not driven . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win from the General @-@ Site @-@ Manager that we can gain clarity and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , aff@@ ecting our members .
the generations of families have worked here and the workers have been foc@@ using on the local community and the large @-@ area Glasgow , a major pillar for de@@ cent work in a territory with high unemployment and social responsibility .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and pro@@ sper@@ ity , and in front of the break of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising of living production costs and chronic production slow@@ down from Glasgow had urg@@ ently need a fl@@ oral production of Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person of Pl@@ adis said : &quot; the presence of Rab@@ in@@ mate has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respon@@ d directly to it , since we estimate continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in Toll@@ cross where some questions were discussed open@@ ly .
we discussed with the staff we are working like all the companies who are working in an extremely competitive economic and un@@ safe economic climate which are ongoing - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
added : &quot; last years , we added more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operating improvements .
we recogn@@ ise the heritage of Toll@@ cross as a production facility and at that time , our operations and trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PSG ago war@@ ned three years ago in front of Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the website of La Liga like her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain put not dis@@ ru@@ pt in her pur@@ suit of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after they had an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release of liber@@ ty , but have been war@@ ned in Barcelona three years ago ?
the sens@@ ational approach has radi@@ ated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record in order to break more than the double of the previous brand , where@@ by Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United .
after completion Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ level professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PSG up of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar turned his way out to the Catal@@ ans , although a fountain has always been given its best to take care of his arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but was the football world purchased three years ago by the PSG @-@ president in front of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 had an interest in Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ a@@ ifi had a strict warning for every club , who wanted to draw one of the top players of PSG .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned if they touch one of our players , then we will contact you in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ a@@ ifi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they are trying to draw one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , where the Spanish club benefit from this summer interest in the PSG @-@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG ProntoSIL there they could not allow it to travel to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ don@@ atzen Report relie@@ ves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
Pope brother George R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s brother George R@@ atz@@ inger was dischar@@ ged in the ra@@ inf@@ use cases .
the author , author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on the Miss@@ blo@@ g@@ and@@ al in the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ don@@ atzen continues to take care of discussions .
Christian Weis@@ n@@ der , spokes@@ man for the re@@ formed movement &quot; We are a church &quot; stated after publication from the earlier Mon@@ s@@ burger bishop and today as Bishop Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ gence Pope Benedict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve as the song of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deep thre@@ ats over their own sub@@ titles or their back app@@ ra@@ is@@ ations .
the programme of the &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; however , however , critic@@ izing the reporting of violence with &quot; two measurements . &quot;
in regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one would have fun to be pun@@ ished and caused by means that the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manip@@ ulation &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ l@@ ia , histor@@ ian and member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ics committee .
&quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all practice , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that is for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ l@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you are looking forward to the church and that is a finished fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; imp@@ acts will have been a quite normal education . &quot; to talk with friends , as I was one . &quot;
it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards on previous decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appears .
author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , founder and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , translated with R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he consi@@ ders the results of the reporting period .
what exactly is in the 440 pages long @-@ page report which was submitted by the Bist@@ um Regensburg with the Rec@@ on Law@@ yer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 547 Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ r@@ atzen were taken between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high pl@@ au@@ sibility . &quot; victims of excess , 67 Dom@@ don@@ atzen sexual abuse .
in the final report it was called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who has been working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , so we hold fast that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had been applied to many cases physical and mental violence .
even with high emot@@ ion@@ ality the pun@@ ishment of pupils could also fall well .
in contrast to many others , there falls to many other votes , as many victims were General humanity by R. SCH@@ EI@@ VES and therefore even in numerous cases , despite violence , even more positive memories of him . &quot;
in an interview , H@@ es@@ emann , why the final report will be relie@@ ved from the German Foreign Exchange Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence of Non @-@ Viol@@ ence &quot; of the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ don@@ Â &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one , many students arise out his &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other , it appears also as chol@@ ester@@ ol and perf@@ ected that the ö@@ f@@ teren was broken , if a dom@@ est@@ atz has no top performance .
how do you see this report as his bio@@ grapher ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to back , you must ask ourselves why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
he has just dedicated eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the Middle or symp@@ athy for the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the viol@@ ation of violence at the pre@@ school took place outside its effectiveness .
you may take advantage of it as late as late or first suggest@@ ions does not have taken seriously .
the physi@@ otherapy of physi@@ otherapy , on which he was real , was perce@@ ived by prac@@ tically all respon@@ d@@ ents - as verb@@ ati@@ able - &quot; rede@@ mp@@ tion , &quot; &quot; heavens &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the wide majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also depic@@ ts him as a &quot; warm heart@@ y , &quot; &quot; popular &quot; , &quot; sin@@ cer@@ ely , &quot; compet@@ ently &quot; and &quot; intellig@@ ently &quot; , &quot; compet@@ ently &quot; and &quot; understanding , and &quot; always assist@@ ed by cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his PER@@ FE@@ K@@ TIO@@ NI@@ SM and its high emot@@ ion which led to black@@ outs too .
he did not only po@@ ke with the chairs and the keys and on the ground , but also ear@@ ed and too fre@@ ak guys in the hair or ears , he has already sought to pro@@ found@@ ly and ap@@ olog@@ ize for it .
however , hon@@ oring salvation , however , it must be said that such appearance methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 197@@ 0s , have been widespread , with parents like teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everybody was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state gram@@ mar school .
compared to what actually is in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse , and viol@@ ent violence in the pre@@ school , the friend of Bag@@ at@@ elles .
you wonder if it &apos;s not more about his notice and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI &apos;s brother , that many media had straight on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him , still e@@ ager@@ ly .
but the truth is : the report relie@@ ves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in connection with the report , in connection with the report a lot about abuse has occurred in the Dom@@ r@@ burger &apos;s cathedral .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs in the final report as well as related or symp@@ athy with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
not only the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aul@@ ts claim to be familiar with the cathedral master .
not even the parents were con@@ secr@@ ated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother , &quot; said one concerned representing the others , &quot; There was all very embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing . &quot;
the true problem at ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse has been and is that most victims were silent .
if they h@@ ired not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral teacher , but professional had been a colle@@ ague of the val@@ leys .
how do you rate the pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to mis@@ use cases ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a frag@@ ile student form@@ ulated this way : &quot; in respect of sexual abuse ... I see ... no fall in which he would have had to know the findings and the respective offen@@ ders .
I consider it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d to accept that ... Bu@@ ying an urg@@ ent or cle@@ ar@@ er or rather re@@ opened as compared to their parents , Inter@@ natural teachers , tru@@ st@@ teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of every symp@@ athy .
thus , it cannot be thrown out , nor put it to be prev@@ ented or dis@@ playing .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contra@@ dic@@ tive crime , as it happened in some cases .
in the media , a lot of &quot; viol@@ ations &quot; should be appearing in the Dom@@ r@@ burger &apos;s cathedral .
the earlier cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is being thrown out of the &quot; Trail &quot; report .
do he have to live with this acc@@ us@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the great problem that was mixed and bl@@ ended with a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and viol@@ ations , and in the middle of the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is exactly the abuse of the report .
it is clean as clean : between the pre@@ school and the gymn@@ as@@ sion of Dom@@ don@@ atzen , between sexual abuse , and viol@@ ations , and say , we say , Other An@@ di@@ fen .
the report inc@@ idents in the period since 1945 , i.e. out of four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger did not master the conductor of the cathedral .
all hor@@ ri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ vi@@ al teachers were regularly cle@@ ared and under@@ lined , and under@@ went all at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where there were really sk@@ and@@ al states have prev@@ ailed .
but with whom the cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he had only been able to face the boys when they were already looking at the Dom@@ Tre@@ at school .
anyway , like most of the witnesses , the subject &quot; School &quot; tab@@ oos .
one was just happy to come to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; para@@ dig@@ ian &quot; states .
what was different from the school &apos;s dom@@ inion ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was a discipl@@ ine , but there was no sa@@ vi@@ al violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , during the conclusion of the conclusion that there are many sacrif@@ ices of humanity by R. SCH@@ EI@@ VES and therefore , in numerous cases , even more positive memories of him . &quot;
and he still remains the fo@@ ref@@ use of having st@@ owed away .
but in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two tim@@ esp@@ aces in which the states have been reported on the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to revi@@ ve and took part in its predecessor , at which he did not work and was , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear , and then again until 1993 .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger believed in front of the conditions consistently the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the school of Dom@@ as@@ ium , which the report was even re@@ produced .
in this he says that in the pre@@ school , it continues to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
already given the danger of negative press releases he was urg@@ ent urg@@ ent .
of course , it was at a time when legal clar@@ ification was to be b@@ anned in Bavaria as an inspec@@ tor .
before they started in a law@@ ful grey zone , as each one knows how to know us .
it was also difficult for him to conclu@@ de that the affected may have been over@@ done or dram@@ at@@ ised , and where really the maximum limit was exceeded .
but one can not say , he would have always looked away .
that is simply not right .
the test was only officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria in 1980 and officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Für@@ st@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis asser@@ ted yes , it is un@@ fair to apply the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at the time of time .
how do you see it ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are speaking of histor@@ ians about the &quot; sn@@ are of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; therefore the danger of today &apos;s moral standards .
the Princess has already quite right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was t@@ orn to all times and also not for what is broken in pre@@ school and violence against inno@@ cent children &apos;s secondary education , that goes far beyond that was retired .
this is all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally finished .
but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ine and pun@@ ishment , thus in the hair and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0s .
as a physical pun@@ ishment he was forbidden , he has kept strictly respec@@ ted .
the image of his ra@@ iny season , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took to you in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
was the subject to inspec@@ t in the language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : now , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedict XVI@@ . , told about his perspective , as the cathedral capture only a minor role .
despite this , I wo@@ e not at all that he led a str@@ ing@@ ent reg@@ iment .
but also this must be said , without these PER@@ FE@@ K@@ TIO@@ NI@@ SM , without having un@@ con@@ ditional Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine , it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world tran@@ spl@@ ant , real cultural bot@@ an@@ ings of Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight twice to the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make any major singers and from every success , right on which area , but always discipl@@ ine , passion and self over@@ coming .
as for a man , you have seen George R@@ atz@@ inger in their book at the talks ?
Michael H@@ es@@ man : through his work on the book and beyond that , I have learned Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , and always experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , tru@@ sted , deep belie@@ vers , deep belie@@ ving and heart@@ y .
I go regularly with how many former domain don &apos;t use today , 23 years after its Emer@@ ging , regularly contact him , he is close to him - he is almost blind and they treat him as a member of their family .
those who are not for@@ given to him by now , that he was once more strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the domains are gr@@ ate@@ ful today , because he en@@ riches their lives and brought them the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ nal teacher - a str@@ enger father , certainly it may be - but also a lie@@ u re@@ pro@@ sp@@ er , to whom they still look up and keep them straight ahead .
and please , even more clearly , all that one acc@@ uses him , are education methods that were then on the agenda .
we can be happy that we have long ago overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man only because he is prominent and a even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin@@ ner .
there is the evil purpose that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report which was just released , relie@@ ves him .
now it would be entitled to buy a 93 @-@ year old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and probably from outside Bay@@ ern@@ s and perhaps one of Germany nobody would have to know any of the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ don@@ Â &quot; in peace .
