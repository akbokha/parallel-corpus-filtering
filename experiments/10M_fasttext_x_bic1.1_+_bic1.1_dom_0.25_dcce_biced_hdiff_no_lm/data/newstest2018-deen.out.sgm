<seg id="2">One Irren Anstalt, where young people will meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A salary chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners entertains the simple reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich conveys exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone, who had to go up again because the Navi Auto Navi took part in a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, a quotation of Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - but just so very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Particularly if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">During the 19th century, the cities and municipalities of the Münchner Merkur will be changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a Flickr family, which one is not recognizable as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great review card, maps and municipalities were presented in detail for towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated according to the Bavarian inviting period between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement in Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wish to wish an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bayerns on behalf of - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even when the French troops tended with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria ticket.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project to the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thereby the Bavarian publishing experience.</seg>
<seg id="19">The foundation sheet for Munich is from the year 1856 and is as far as all other on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the country's capital is an impressive example of today's capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shipling was built 21 years after the map, including the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today submission is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of subsilings to be named in 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, you see nothing fields - at first glance: at the Hinrichly there is a small part of duplication lines and figures: handwriting numbered pieces from the so-called "uranium." from which the property tax was deducted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots reveal no more rural estate today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of submerling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 venue of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century, actually a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the prototype row, in the area of today Au-Haidhausen, you read only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "On the fans" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfield road you could barrier people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich district of Irrenanstalt recorded "On the Auer fans."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudrun the decor - that psychiatrist, which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced to his time and ended for example the quettes of the so-called Irish.</seg>
<seg id="36">He also has instructed the staff to apply violence against the insurances, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has employed for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first, later on 500 places expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime there was no longer a capacity so far - the reason for the construction of the cirurendering plant in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East Germany is one of Germany's largest psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="40">Adolescents are now based on the area of former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order issued the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth-home with vocational training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural rejection of the Irrenanstalt's origin, which was destroyed by bombing in World War II.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as a "main square" listed, the department was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The second world war broke the second world war in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies had many holes in the city centre in December of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, Small Business Halls and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where the days going to work and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich will take place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich-map with the picture of today - and the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Law publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">National Association for the promotion of colour states has shown a warning for colored people who travel to the discrimination of politics and the racist attacks of the State to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory authority shall apply to the State of Missouri, who encourage customers and Missourianer, on travel through the State of particular attention, as a number of fragments, rassenbased accidents in the entire state may be noted and here," says it's in the statement of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, which makes people heavier, discrimination complaints, and the prosecution of the state, which causes disproportionate to minorities as well as the group of travel buddies, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"you have passed violations of civil rights to happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are faced because of their skin colour, they are smitten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency, which we don't have heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that issued the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group trembled such as a racist violation against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under a questionable circumstances in the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline on the journey through the State nor granted by the police of Missouri, without a crime fiction sometime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council has also been shown on a recent report by Missouri Office, which is shown that black motorists will be more likely to be more common in the State of 75 percent more common.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of their friends and their families, friends and staff who could happen in Missouri." said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be ready to bring it to the country, or let their relatives know that they are travelling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hearing crimes, based on the latest figures from the FBI, the State of such injuries to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had adopted amendments for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration shall be obligatory to negotiate people because of migrant violations, which will contribute to the view of the ACLU for further riassing profiles.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warning will usually be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries but in the lately they have employed the measure in response to certain laws and trends in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Pasture-aunching project is elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishing bacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagsimputies Peter White and Cordula Kovac have obtained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the right-excavation of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fishery CDU-city group met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm where it houses 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, as well as many kittens and houses in five residential apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black skimmed milk" is for him the alternative selector path for the milk of his cows, so pivoting.</seg>
<seg id="73">The table of the holiday guests is only Regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fishing bach, he honored the weidezren project as "elementar."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't be profitable on such areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The farm grabs for much work, much cousions can be processed using the sense of the sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and the topography," emphasized Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not perform bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune recognized the meaning of the idezaunts and is delighted with the leader-funding."</seg>
<seg id="80">For 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that this stills of the areas could go beyond a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure which we have, are the people who work in agriculture and thought about it," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in critique because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the Weidezren promotion.</seg>
<seg id="85">The closure of the area is 40 hectares that cannot be opened until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">In the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the current cost was promoted, a quarter carried out by the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">As a result, farmers remained in the farmers 12 610 euros, and they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Cordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job, no farmers and farmers do not work."</seg>
<seg id="90">Even for Peter White stood firmly: "here the best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape profiles (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state-support of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The purpose is to keep the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR feature is altered.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, non-tanning area should not be perseverably managed (slope over 35 per cent) and must thus be threatened by the solication.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishing bacher Weidezren project, the deadline expires eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="96">The closure area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attackle the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as every other - therefore the well-directed downfall Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regimes, knew what he did, when he took a symbolic aulically with Jim Acosta of CNN on the suggestions of the legal dispute with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of bounding owners and Liberty Imitators had caught him if it had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed of their importance, and in particular the importance of which you are attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta decimped: "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, referring to you, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively real, but as he himself formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It comes to a tremendous response to the shimmering words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only enter any old immigrants, but the poor crowds that accidate themselves to breathe, and the poor waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh waste" was better on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict regarding the meaning of a statue is a part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who had decided to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that they complete a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and Americanical republican, representing the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem is the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself is a quite different name: mother of the exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the gedichism with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus did the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change their wings from the right wing this long ago.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming from Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is easy to bring the American flame into the recovered world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It aims to bear the torch of Freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Fackel should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh here to be something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of the perception of the perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantastic deed of Lazarus was found to see them as they were seen from the crested, but hopeless people looking after long and often awful trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It's the true sense that the world is looking for people from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever would like to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not lighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK teams</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembered a time when only two shallots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says the 16-member Scottish Contingent in the world championship team "afford a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that in Scotland was a special project "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand, and we will continue to find out what we'll need to find out," said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak with people at the Scottish institutes of sport and think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish Athlets think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish Athlets are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butare - who were able to compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen from the team as team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitol speech was incredibly, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scotland or wherever they were, or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling, the rush of naturally include, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, which will compete for their fifth world championships with 400-m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 shoots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Currently the best Total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The downstream Muir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5.000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another carrot that was supposed to observe the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered their first world championships as the only other Schotte in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team capitalism says that they are "enormously proud" on the fact that many of their countrymen are not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and during the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"it is so special about the team capitalism, that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour, but to know that my teammates have chosen for me and make me something special for me," added them.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I'm very proud of all the shoots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are concerned here as well-established athletes, athletes wanting to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as a capital concerns?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go and compete, and it just will be such a great atmosphere. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not manage to ban a public office if you do not tolerate the inclination of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our land knew something of bad media.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of all the internal policy until his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shrink with the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics in silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For the year 1783, Washington said: "freedom of freedom can be removed - and dumb and mute we become as sheep to battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, which has to work for more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this week because of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The rod of the governor, dismissed the complaint as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a countercampaign with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important when it's a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is an Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the epithelial consent of the 50 Governors of the Nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skiped to use Facebook as pristworthy means to displaying with his voters and supporting his haarless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockade of persons that comes to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is designated as officially and by employees who are paid in public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Spreader in Amelia chasse defended the actions of the governor and argue that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of TROLLEN or air-filled people who scroll the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hitting, but she asked for an crime scene.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented, that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hassler and other current news," wrote it in the news area of the news posting "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I guess this idea, even if a number of people will be on the same subject, they will be disregarded as such as a beneficial collective duty and not recognized as a large group of citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">As the employees of the Governors as "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "Principality."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cutting a message by simply blocked a critic or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much more precise than in earliest days if you have been dispatched that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical editorials and demonstrate demonstrators, or demonstrate demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens now.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials which criticises that he has vaccinated Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is suing by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County blast the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, as it was an electorate from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time Washington's time, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800; and anonymous letter signals struck their leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington anonyme trophy.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who were pseudonyms such as "juricola," "Valerius", "Belisarius," and "Portius," used all the letters to newspapers, the Washington's decisions made.</seg>
<seg id="202">In particular, petitions which criticises its position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping of the United Kingdom with UK criticised his dominion, according to historical documents, which were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have her to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression and discourse belong to the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="259">An existing movement which resurred for independence against the dutch dominion, turned back to the government of Jakarta who maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.</seg>

<seg id="355">The bread is exactly out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here are building everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain much of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rupies (75 Cents).</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try out of Indonesia's unduous provinces of Papua and Westpapua more: Visa Electron and a black list," he said in a declaration.</seg>

<seg id="393">A study by the management of the Torch Building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of damages is covered by the cladding, the outdoor cladding for decoration or insulation.</seg>

<seg id="402">One will continue to work to improve the application.</seg>
<seg id="403">Not just as a vote was, after a lot of plans, the final decision was able to apply the final on a neutral place.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk visits the huge number of preferences for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">So far he has learned that a part of the customer has withdrawn their binding reservation again.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the always triumphal numbers compared to sales figures, Tesla-Boss Elon Musk has reported for the first time another number of poor figures for the first time results: the cancellations made a new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In the past few months, Musk frequently entered the new car with more than 500.000 provisions for the new car, whose delivery has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Musk cleared this: from the total of 518,000 provisions, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics had always pointed out that it is only a non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla paid the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 dollar and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Offer request" is fully returned.</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently, 455.000 of such non-binding reservations before, Musk cleared in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the cancellation of so far only twelve percent of all orders to be solved, however, the Tesla Boss is not believed.</seg>
<seg id="430">Its argument: the challenge to the ambitious aims of growth is not in demand, but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">In the past year, Tesla produced 84.000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models have to be combined - 500,000 one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, reservations are currently per day 1800 reservations.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who can be ordered today a "Model 3" may be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tesla then creates his brand new, never even in practice proven production roads without bigger breaks.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts despair that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if it comes to bigger delays, then the inscription of reservations for Tesla could become Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company can't fail to avoid unsatisfied customers in droves.</seg>

<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the Lynch, because we are confronted with its hematility in all," she said.</seg>
<seg id="608">"but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen or hear, what I am doing through."</seg>

<seg id="628">And precisely the energy in space, a feeling of camera operator replacing the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="629">Everyone is busy with it, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene begins once more.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time, when Rascona the N word says it says sharp and with reprint.</seg>

<seg id="641">Up to this point the Morde remained an Anecdote, but now if one is located on the same country where the Lynch Morda showed, the air feels gateful.</seg>
<seg id="642">When the last notes sound out, Greene loads them to get closer and inspect the dead.</seg>
<seg id="643">Children hopes on their heads, record the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other.</seg>
<seg id="644">"they're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, when he would like to remember it.</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have steamed the speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that the economic growth "jobs" will remain in when they kept the interest rates on a family household in the middle of a reinforced pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 for reducing interest rates to 0,25%, whereby less members had a rise in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened its support.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly annual inflation forecast, the Bank reduced their growth prognosis for 2017 to 1.7% and in 2018 at 1.6% and predicted that the pressure would continue to rise to almost 3% in the fall.</seg>

<seg id="1269">It will be provided time for finance plans to provide for banks, as from the upcoming February budget funding available for banks, though it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with a minimum of 115 billions of pounds.</seg>
<seg id="1270">After the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "in the central forecast of MPC, gross domestic product remains weak, as the pressure on households continues to result."</seg>
<seg id="1271">In interest rates, they repeated that "a certain amount of monetary policy for the cooling of inflation and a" somewhat bigger "extent required would be expected when the markets are expected.</seg>

<seg id="1283">The decision is a year following lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the Sinken's sinking.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and economy completely.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the final judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the call rose to a rate of interest rates, because inflation was climbed to a hard rise in July, with three political decision makers in July.</seg>

<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banking press with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 by a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her pockets and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was similar to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nice layout - one had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - supper Joanne Stauraum and add a mezzanine to keep the spacious ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, much light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">It was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the Architect and Design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill that was able to use a home at 12.5 feet high ceilings, not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectonic challenge was able to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">This fan had to think creative thinking to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is rather complicated," explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were overstacked, without that we had to answer.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just about to build a simple platform, but to create the steel that it had the right height or bottom. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled it to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Retrouvius down over the glamorous home area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage serge Mouille lighting use the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role when adding the theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">There is a short corridor mirrored on both ends to work for longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units place for all kinds and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garland door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit engineering art went in," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it's opposite so that if you push the door open, very slightly glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the smart use of space and storage room Joanne could win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," said Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a corrupt form, a real estate broker occur and a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to enlarge the floor space, while simultaneously use high quality materials, which provide the space its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and so are helping to create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can change by good design and increased square metersitude of some default in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Indeed, like Joanne, you could decide to leave this not.</seg>

<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed violations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers also struggle for control over the existing business - which Colin, like Paul claimed to be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul, some concern himself to manage.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit, it was filed by Colin, he says he will trust the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage is writing that the family is the most important priority." he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs are in the case with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports of companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and by both sides dangerous lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants starting from the late 1950-s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1950 "s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood heritance, where Colin opened first jeansers of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin said that he was there, when he was "High School" in my last years, when Paul was still a child (10 years old). "</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis tells her that she and Luigi who died in 2012, hoped to share their property to their sons.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, and Colin claims that Mark while leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke and Mark, Paul: "says Paul" about the terms of their financial separation. "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has kept very retracted, though it was a former AFL board member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax media took us in contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin responded by SMS to say "I really cannot say much," because the case was before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad to understand that my brother Paul has decided to complain about and to draw our family name by courts" he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have won, that Paul and I would end in our current dispute," he said and added that he was still waiting for a solution. "</seg>

<seg id="1388">Mumps is planning to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly might actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President Trump - including the reports of the media - in the hope, the boss on an equivalent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of White House, he set up a major problem in President Donald Trump white House, which he repair wool: bad information that would rode into the hands of the presidents.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in postings - because of the president will meet better decisions when he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to imitate trump, monitor his media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television reaches decades - and now where he is in the White House, its TV is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the Candidate was eradicated because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting advisor Sam Nunberg, in February opposite POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key, mumps Twitter-habit consists of control, according to six former election campaign officers in it, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Alright now.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps has ever been "under control" has been ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaigns have something that we do not know other - that Trumps has even more combustible items without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know something about the tweet, the trump not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had made it a few times, anger from him, then their efforts have been well worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently avoided it that Trump's controversial causes.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people together in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda, which promotes trump material, which may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - quite busy with this story in May, the preference of the consultants that presided over the prediction for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example taken by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-Beamte say that Trump can react to negative press-outs, particularly such with damaged lecs, and that he can be confident to find out from whence they come.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Just that happened in late February when somebody returned to the president of an article by Gotsch.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who was the deputy Chief of Katie Walsh, who decided to be the source behind a bunch of Lecks' in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was scanned because of scissors permanently from Twitter, or that he did not have any specific evidence or expressed in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold macher, added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tries to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts three months later, the same to do.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and its advisors still seek influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Sea requested criminal cases post by Europol</seg>
<seg id="1419">Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population will pray and hoped.</seg>
<seg id="1420">The police deflew throughout Europe in this summer (virtual) postcards to the dangerous crime on the run.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Since the addresses of the requested words are not known naturally, are references from the population hopes and praying.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Europol reported on Friday from the action on Friday, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" calendar of winter.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The experiences could have been shown that many flecous people are hiding at the side of Europol.</seg>

<seg id="1429">The travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull which is called the Millionärs series. "</seg>
<seg id="1430">They have horses, babies, and an army of transports, having been kicked out in May, without having been forced from the council to prevent her accidents.</seg>
<seg id="1431">The takeover group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles by a section which remained unobstructed to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Desert residents afflicted the advice of Solihull, who said it was "useless" with the problem. "</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous resident said, "You're on Monday evening after they were sent forward by Bentley Heath where stones have thrown on the passage.</seg>
<seg id="1434">The Council must be forced to implement in fact when dealing with the problem was useless.</seg>
<seg id="1435">The travelers were in May there, moved on and are now back again.</seg>
<seg id="1436">More were yesterday evening, probably still more. "</seg>
<seg id="1437">Added: "the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by giving long subdirectives to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="1438">I live at the Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to pay my municipal tax when the Council can stop this again. "</seg>
<seg id="1439">A roommate, who did not want to be called, said: "it is ridiculous, we just saw the last round of those travelers only to be ploted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="1440">The numbers have raised time and you even saw a horse in the park area. "</seg>
<seg id="1441">Speaking of the Council of Solihull: "we are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and working with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary steps to take them as fast as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to support our reference collection, it is very important that as many people register an anti-social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101.</seg>
<seg id="1443">This is to do with a picture of the situation, in which the dish has to check, when we propose our case. "</seg>
<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof is Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">From the former hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is situated.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the Freudenstadts doors are being renovated and will be reopened on March 1 next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing time of the Hotel Birkenhof, the renovation of the Hotel Birkenhof were lost around 30 000 nights per annum during the time of the city of Birkenhof as of 13 April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, despite a dramatic increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which took care of controversial discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city preventrified the housing of asylum seekers by the list of the construction plan to secure the area as hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed in the council at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadts, Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious prospective customers at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisendeans with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a volunteer auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The Group has four houses with the Freudenstädter building.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Men.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the previous hotel Birkenhof, since longer time construction container are available in front of the entrance, and when one entering the house is noticeable, how extensive renovations are performed.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors have been torn, ceilings to be assembled, old bathers from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer's talk with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are furnished in large shower, the input area is designed and new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything that later is "beautiful." how Thomas Scherer is expressed.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to do a jewel."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, spa area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">You can't rely on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a higher level of downtown, emphasizes sound.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms are wool, and explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He had already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Thomas Scherer did not want to determine exactly following the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under a million euro, he expects.</seg>
<seg id="1476">Outside the external plants are also given to the front, which is clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard, a large terrace arises from the restaurant, which is open to public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: U.S. Completion Comes Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In Russia-affair about US President Donald Trump to have set a special investigator Robert Mueller to a report so called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In recent weeks, the Panel wrote the work recorded by the "Wall Street Journal, confidential persons under appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper marked the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded his investigation and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN station reported that I already give first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps or a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us secret services complain the Kremlin for longer to have mixed a mixed in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether they gave foreign languages between Trumps Association and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are going to act as a consultant to the Republican League.</seg>
<seg id="1487">In fact, Mueller took also more and more Trump's private and commercial environment under the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote some weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally bridged and the accusation, whether the President may be obstructed by the president in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">To check and decide whether the main task of Grand Jurys is to test and decide if charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Therefore Grand juries are therefore also called the Indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually switched on when it is about bigger and controversy cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to submit people to perception.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, pre-invitations were issued to turn the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were issued at a statement, named it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. also Trumps were also standing advisor and mother-law Jared Kushner and his German election campaign Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts say on Thursday evening in the U.S. TV that Mueller will not abandon himself in his work, and that he should be necessary to respond quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, if the Grand Jury will not be turned on at the end, the Grand Jury will decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Yet the suspension of the committee of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the middle of the new disclosure of the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia in order to represent the Russia Affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia's story is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject give the democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about it. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion, he knoweth nothing from the integration of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But I usually work in secret, stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorse all measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator to "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI leader James Comey told three times that will not be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to perceive that something has changed to it, called it in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey was fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this Rauswurst, you have become a cassesity against trump, and he would like to impress the justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before an Senate committee, Trump gave him a cessation of investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under big pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dequest speculation over it, whether trump cap dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate-Affair, Mueller has reproduced a position in which he could be fired in the theoretical session of the President of the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators arrived on Thursday's legislations, after which the special investigator could no longer be released.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic ice berg pushes in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western arctic ice, a gigantic iceberg has solved the barely seven times of Berlin from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This attended the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The above one trillion tons heavy and 5800 sq km big Koloss driver now north and will probably need two, three years until it had melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest Ice giant, the researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people goes not out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change has played a role in the quarry's breakdown, is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, for approximately 30 years, there has been an unusual collapse of ice skids in the region, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, it could be related to warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Now the Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is therefore always growing steadily into the sea and crashes regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this shooting was the equilibrium of waxes and break off several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shot-fei was to fall there, writes AWI research Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a matter that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never been drawn far as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate understands the voltage and could be broken in case of a key place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The fusions of feelfeis and iceberg increases the sea level, because they pushed on the water, and ice it so much water, as it yields to the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, loss of feariness leads to light the glacier directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, however, only in the low degree, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis of the Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">The mainland by the mainland is up to 700 metres thick, along the front edge towards the free ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"even though there is a natural happening and is no direct connection to climate change, the ice-label now comes into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists be controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis resumed to be back or long-term, perhaps his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models said that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher lead the abruptcy of this gigantic ice rame not to climate change, so many ice skating the Antarctic Peninsula have been crushed in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long keris of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula have gone back to 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline was contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have warmed up around three degrees around the past 50 years, so that the temperature in which the temperature is the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to save pet at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is more difficult to occupy jobs, the CDU calls for the CDU to become more attractive to the employer.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the Kreistag has left 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county management in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now you have 17 trainees in their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers at the circle are obviously very coveted.</seg>

<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers are searched as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to conquer the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG to confront the trade in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">Management should accompany a concept to personnel and human development after the wish of the parties. "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to cover not only short-term conservation of professionals, but to oppose the candidate shortage, is called it.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept has to orientate inside and outside, concrete measures for transversal and a training offensive, requiring CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">It sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has done it with personnel problems that you used to know so much earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a real "competition of the public employer."</seg>
<seg id="1568">This includes a high number of employees, the disease or age related to the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">The highest time for action so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, President of the CDU, continues beyond the joint proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He wanted to make a fist big surprise for a fist big surprise, when he presented the number of personnel publicly in question and the other parties flourred.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all the ways to check out a withdrawal from the municipal employer.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we are not at short notice of a satisfactory solution, the county seat should be scattered with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the circular cities - a domestic fee," so peoples.</seg>
<seg id="1574">Thus, the CDU also tries to pay more than the employee and officials better than the Tarifordding to the Public Service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exemplated, increases or more money, only if one changes in a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle always grew more in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1822">Although in 2010, a Sonder Bundesanwaltz was established in order to rename the cases of journalists, which led to the protection of journalists to the protection of journalists only two penal procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As for most of the thousands of murders, each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderer shall be prosecuted of only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Feodoce they still exist, to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are innocent, even though the terrain is still slanted.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting of discussing security is somewhat benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time to turn," says he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the reason why we know all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the City of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced from two men, and was shot to him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which was translated with "Twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The contactors went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing as silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Last year since Guzmans arrest in January and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rivalent fractions occurred here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not make that in Sinaloa each day someone or several people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of ornaments, two-story pulp een for drug must be greater than many houses for the Living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget about a minute, there is a state of "tranquility," if only a chair has the control over the Küstenstaat with its precious ports and drugs trading in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Feodoce that he was not ascribed to protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February the publication of an interview recorded with a garo Lopez, a leader of the rivalent cardboard fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have erucleated the children, probably the band had delivered each copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to the newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in Cdez, not to force madez, after the confiscation of a different newspaper, which had released the same story to leave the country to his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad; and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survives that his friends and colleagues would show that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, engaged in five colleagues in the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without crying on the smopoison problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and the revenue and advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish hard treating surveys without fear of censorship, and the reader were fascinated by a publication that they could not dare to handle anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Prize for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the prosecution of Mexican drugs, wherever they were.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to relive," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done so many tothe... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodce-Team missed Valdez, the Spaßvogel as a harbor worker was able to curse the friend, the generously with hugs and advice, a teacher, the knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guabo, the Bar from the office and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Let us ask her: was his love for routine his verbs?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions, how they work best in their work and live on life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like to move with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their homes, and runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-ensorship and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The offender was, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then is the thing happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no more - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries, in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative grooves, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the employees of Riodoce came to the security training, no mobile phones were allowed. days ago previously announced that Spyware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor Journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">There were two policemen from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Feodoce in a four-storey building in a center of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in a joke, some of the reporter asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen as not trusted by himself.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter has gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug de facto are facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has bundled on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They had also an excité to the state spending that concentrates on the hometown of Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block away from the office of the Public Prosecutor, an abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word, who was kidnapped, or how it happened, so was careful when everyone in the city know that the restaurant is a favorite locally designed by drug traders and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter ran from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the governing revolution Party (pri), which conquered all the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several pri governors have been accused of corruption due to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal bat the reporter, about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which one son of "El Chapo" Guzman went into a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago, the reader mentioned the column by Valdez, regarded as the best viewed source about the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier, we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slender body keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez Office has been devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers that Protestants against the moral of journalists, because the employees has become something that they had never expected; activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">In Miriam Ramirez, a few signs came and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration for an additional journalist to the office of the government.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In all the country Journalists are sound more than they have written in organized protests of "SOS Press" on walking paths and subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez went to Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">When meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to express the journalist and let them destroy them, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has been asked since it has been shared by the government because they worried that their wounds has injured their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, the government officials and an equal society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his final book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that Reporter has not only been killed by drug companies, but also on orders of politicians and security forces, which were under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">In the past year, the media turnout group "Articulo 19 has more than half of the attacks assigned to journalists of the police and officers.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because it would like that you are in the mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the morals have a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody thats the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern borders of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by Zetas cartel: "here I am with my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones beside their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to include, like El Norte in the northern borders of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondents MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others will continue to do like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez presented itself to the drummers with a Editorial at the cover page "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are fled from their hometown countries or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are chased, as evidently by photographer Reuben Espinosa, who had been murdered in a flat in Mexico City three months after escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who remain and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once would be poets to be poorching his drug trafficking him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight the last Friday, when the last edition was already terminated, the editors of Feodoce began on the office in front of the office and drank beer than once all their telephones began to summed.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shades with band rivales and security forces near the bathing place Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued, as it was promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the brandy show you have published the news on the website of Feodoce on mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirenen heulten near - a further shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez had a look at the policemen, holding the guard to see if they were in willingness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">When they were afraid at all, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose central finger was visible for a whole of Sinaloa, the employee of Riodoce followed its marks.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" Bojorquez, "If on the same day, Javier the practitioner, she asked me to send me a report on the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage used to soften its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight, it looks like a statue, even a scary.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now researchers have found that the first insights on the incredible rhino ns of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts have described as "Mona Lisa the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even determine that his scaly skin of reddish Braun was - and they said they had had something from a "unpeaceful past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the bestered dinosaurs which ever was found, and one of the best Dinosaurs copies of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaus which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievable good preserved state is explorer that describe it as a "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant fresser is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Radio when he was held on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something of the surrounding rock was missing on the platze, and decided to look at more precise.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil, which was discovered by him, was sent into the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal on the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy cold rump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you twinkle only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will be one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs specimens - Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researcher have found that this plant nivore is covered, even though with a armor, resembles the breastplate, probably threatened by meat and accus dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage used to hide themselves ahead of predators, and used a shield technology that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix into its surroundings, and by its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs has first made headlines in May and is now being shown in the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and sold it to Borealopelta mark.elli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the copies enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, patterns and the form of shed and armor of his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shady, a widespread defense of defence in animal kingdom, signifying that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shady is customary, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta grew by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure through meat devout Dinosaurs, the evolution of confrontation of confrontation was beneficiently benefited as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of contemporary animals that use the shaded chatching - think of deer, Zebras or madillos - are much smaller and violation than prey that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a true fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"a powerful robbing behaviour on a massive, strongly stuffed dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been the craving time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the Dinosaurgets rotbrown was.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists are still searching the animal on critics, including his conservative gut halfway to find out what it has eaten as his final meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, sank into a river and sank into the sea where it sank to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern floral today, and rivers and oceans spread much further inward than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurs is really remarkable because it remains completely covered with conservative skin, but also in three dimensions remains preserved and preserved the original shape of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly like in the early circles.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use lots of imagination to renovate it. if you like a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The creation time was a time when giant Theropodes, carnivores Dinosaurriere, crossed on two legs, the earth crossed through.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, million years after Borealopelta, the company had driven dinosaurs from some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">The Acrocanthosaurus belongs to a 38-foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose most recent findings appear in current biology, believe Borealopelta after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Radio as he was held in Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum it is the bezzled dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the Schnauze until hips.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures have an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes, which ragged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant flows through the Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater caption of the Dinosaur survived its armour in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The Petrified remnants of this special edition are so good that the skin remains still cover the crater tank along the Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is so rare as a profit in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Pirate remains of the skin still cover the dubib tanks that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His upright forefoot is at its side, his five fingers spread to the above.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the shed at his sole '.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: barely 30 vehicles are involved in a mass-bearing line.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous final, kilometre Staus and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) in the late Thursday afternoon, 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first information of the police were at 17.00 in between the entrances Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, nearly 30 vehicles, including cars, including lorries, attacked.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Above the exact number of the last lines, no data were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It is about light to medium injuries, said a police officer.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A great surrender to rescue vehicles was at the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In travel from Munich, a ten-kilometre long beach was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As an AZ reporter, it was also reported on the counter to massive disabilities - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade notched the signs of the vehicle's deflection, which now have to count with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 am then another second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Thereby it was come to a collision between a car sports and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A helicopter helicopter was on the way towards the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced even has: nothing can be sitting on the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a great thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Even the Schaffner and wakes up an unsoft or stoppeth the ride in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Bike check control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the controverless bicycle control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply by phone allowing users to take his place and evaluate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test company runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"the offer is available, wide and wide.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote traffic routes in Germany, "said a railway-speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is the train of the ticket analysis without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to use this, you need to meet some requirements: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And one must have booked an online ticket - what do you have to do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It must also be purchased via the rail, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last one needs a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The "comfort check-in" works as: one climbs into the train, calls his ticket under "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">In the review, a button for electronic determination will then appear.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The accompanying person on their mobile devices have a notification that passenger car is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When a ticket control is done in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already fixed online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two benefits: one for the customers, one for rail - which is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who relaxes without ticket inspection through our access personnel, check out in the DB Navigator basic yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables passengers to make their travel time in the train, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB Ferntraffic.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual needs of your needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who frequently proceeds, know that beside the delays and missed trains guide the map controls are among the biggest sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often in any case, one of the passengers do not have all documents which you need to validate online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or a identity card is missing or otherwise a document that you have to prove.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussion between migrators and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the downside or large space and delays at the end of their own tickets and the workers at the end takes care of taking other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">You can only use a small number of test customers the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that is only considering the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">More access numbers on the same circuit are not unlocked yet.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist concluded that the answer to the question is: "Whose quets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken by her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after being arrived in New York City, he sat in St. Louis, born on the bed of a airbnb flat, who rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post of somebody from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police killed just a 18-year-old child, and there is still on the street, called it there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused because nobody had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was continually captured on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postponed a picture of browns that was stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought at him.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death for her and community was nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She laid her cell phone, in order to return to the Canfield Drive in the evening via people on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police and people that cried out, and by a man who claimed, who claimed a shield with the wording: "Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They observed a live feed in which a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a rebellious dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, supervised another policeman, and cried, saying, "I will kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered its testimony.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"that is not the kind of murder, which we are accustomed to us and we can name it typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt sweets.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson in the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary cinema, "Whose quets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>

<seg id="2042">As Ferrel with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, wore the two a conversation, that they had numerous times before this morning "on the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for that in what they believe?" she reminded of what she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go now to Ferguson because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take them away, "said Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You must know it and they can see it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well designed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have been lucky to give you an experience while they do not experience a delatex racism, it is no different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep it away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop, when she was in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authorities, which was promoted to a campus, as the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There am far to Ferrell and their daughter with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to transfer them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for fermentation.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Students Student-St. Louis, based on essences of justice and health freedom in black municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later we met Ferrell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question got Ferrell in the sense: "you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">These skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often of women - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we had heard that people who have been born in Ferguson and have grown up their voices, and we wanted to do it."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, a artist from the area that has been known for its activism around Todestrakt insurances.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project to the project, together with six other natives followed the team of "Whose quets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is no one who speaks for us or talk to us. we say" said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people are depicted, as I will be depicted."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is in the movement "not for a Messiah leader but to come together," said Folayan - they proved to be the revealed participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, they show documents from "Whose quets?" surprising personal aspects of Ferrells life as she married and married her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that in this work and for the creation of black people must give a certain injury."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells has repeated the role of the black wears women in the broader Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of movement, who formed the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identified two of the three founders of the black teenagers in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are struggling to different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must bear the main last of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement truly is kept in black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it exists that "this is not affirdest kind of action," at the distance because of its identity as the heart of the movie was selected.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who roared this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although they had an front front because with a life on these crises as a black, gay woman says so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">The news show in Ferguson has long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police are still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell provides for 2 ½ years because of the block of a motorway with a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless, she cloned to a song and she feels committed to this memory since three years ago it was on the street in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "magnitude": TV reader discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">Bit Gallery moves the people, although they are not yet built long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation of 2009 the population in proponents and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the theme is hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">During the one to the bit-gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "Das would be real-class" (Nicole Schausten), coming from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or completely simple: "size delight!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents rests upon it, a gallery of more customers are moving in the city, from which the other transactions may benefit, fear the pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery will be displayed right on the grounds, on which the market hall stands, in the 13 direct selling of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The start of the construction will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely the Beda square with the possibility to sitting outside sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been selling almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious pie of the farmers always liked very much.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also have discovered the butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that, during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "moves to the market at a market hall in the gallery, on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But it should probably not be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping scraped in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothes, shoes, draught, or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a proper weekly market, it is so important that at least the market hall will remain.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all the commodity product is fresh, mostly is offered directly from the producer and is purely cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, stores are rented in a shopping centre only of larger companies, because the rents are often not portable for a single trader.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special stores are almost no more and what still remains, then will probably clear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fits me together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all, where should the farmers market stand during the building time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in duration if the bit gallery is actually sometime.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it have to distribute the ghosts bit gallery before, to distribute all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's simply not working.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, there is no one needed.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market rather than this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market there is no space thanks to the mad many - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market is carried out, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown which are almost invisible - the cables are hung on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-victims and shank, created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst had a 35-year-old prison after they openly made diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondent between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline agreed their expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transformers and a pioneering dissidents that he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could be extracted by manning, and some intellectual comment not only too the form of DNA-data - the many wise men as it can be interpreted and the inherent Determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, was already spoken to the identification as woman, was convicted for 20 accusations, including six charges against spy, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so it was only one single photo gave - a gradient, black and white Selfie, sitting on a driver seat in which Manning has been sitting and a platinate blonde carries out - which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In the year 2015 Dewey-Hagborg returned from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist portraits from foreigners from forensic artifacts like cigar and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste extracted, such as these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when they received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"you led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and she wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't be visited at this time, and couldn't be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal wallet, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppume Images" from a Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppume Images," which would be pronounced in the future, in which the President of Chelenaday would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama would actually be published only a few days after the book would call for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There's also now in the opening of the exhibition a little deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war with informant from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to remedy that it should actually be escaped.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a given reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery described above mentioned manning with their oversized signatures (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic shredder, whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written by thousands of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg has hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), like amazing, at least in biological ways we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully be taken to see, who we are not concerned, who we are and like openly genetic data for interpreting and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA-data can tell as many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is kept in an own room is a side from the mentioned comic-noelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she emerges from the Disciplist attacks in the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they keep your speech, they have won" says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so you never halt the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote me," said the artist, greet it from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I'm always gateful if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - as expected in the comic book was taken away - but when they were greeted, they will be greeted by their own genomic simulations, from their own genomic simulations, as hordes of protesting.</seg>
<seg id="2155">That was targeted as everything in the exhibition, until the size (5 "2, Mannings stature) where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of people," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel that it feels like a mass movement which formed with Chelsea as the movement, which was also called behind their liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human jagd is for a full professor at Northwestern University and a employee of the University of Oxford who had been suspected of a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>

<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victims had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents: "the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the victim, and explores a variety of motifs, including a possible domestic advantage."</seg>

<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public Opinion about the Regulators" said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or imethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumers-boycott, worker ctuation and flames, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convertible has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previous when an employee wants to report a problem, he had to find or her a telephone number or e-mail to the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an assessment and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said it gave no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company Convercent is able to migrate problems that were hiding in offices in cities or states that were identified - like discrimination, harassment or untiled interns.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can go closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience working with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint as well Convercent offer your software as service, and loads the company with recurring charges for using their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the consent of Venture Capital Investors that have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million from the financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Over $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners has secured its total financing to $60 million.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Investors attends its portfolio if its portfolio is well run. it run well, when employees are working and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics Tools raised third parties, commitment and commitment to the employees, it is no wonder that you can find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the Administrator does not take any measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact when a company asks people after your feedback, there may have a expectation that change on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or even at all, this disappointments and employees can be motivate.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It comes to 23 o'clock, when a lot of UCLA footballers undergo a page of the new exercise fields of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have crossed off their tricotoberts and display the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">This unemployed minutes is for a good part of the team.</seg>

<seg id="2264">"that's the guys who had the next three days a real tretmill" said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora short before the Monday ended on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2265">NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore the first three training sessions of UCLA should begin at 19: 15 to fulfill the players already packed.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times gets on West wood practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They should hold out in the course of August 18 exercises. 20 before beginning of formal playing preparations for their prelude against Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">MORA said that he add the regular changing of NCAA rest, even if they add a further point to the various routes of the player.</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we lay these enormous loads three or four days at them, and it is very challenging," said Mora.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they simply pressed them, they fell on, they are great people.</seg>
<seg id="2272">I think we will come up until Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "</seg>
<seg id="2273">The UCLA will finish their internships as soon as the camp is finished, with the clear view of its fields from a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, which has already been sheltered with foot balls, which will already be a protective screen behind a goal posts that will be no slight task.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Broins players will occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora cleared that it could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will be deploying our security," said Mora.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"it's a real problem, and it is not far to think that people would rent a room there and then set there to record a practice.</seg>
<seg id="2277">If you have the video wall from an exercise, it is a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="2278">But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.</seg>
<seg id="2279">We will do the best, with what we have.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a Comic-ROM: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980-he years a loophole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cosy seat in the irrigate River valley in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wearly.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'surrounds the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book by Rhodes, based on an archive. he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected.</seg>

<seg id="2299">And Letters always smells of smoke, because then there was fire on the light because of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives more than 300 years later, the scent has a effect, as if he himself had.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For anyone looking so with old papers, he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in one castle lived ("To be honest: I just seems to be a bit too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" Castle to study the archives and curiosities of the castle and curiosities of the castle and the bottles that had spent several centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He migrated the site and ruins of the old castle, and talked with landscapes, gardening, and sometimes with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night, he drank whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust was only recently received the full access as the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes got a decade later, the staff started to worry about the archive, which he spoke to "hundreds of years, in which Aristocrats spoke" Oh, throw it on the loft. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diapositions, letters from the time of the English empires, maps who admire, who would say: "one could mean that rural conflict would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go out his aisle! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection take the castle as a starting point to break on a wider basis into the English story, including 'The Labourer' which leaves the newly built Castle to connect to the farmhouse of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant rose in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which was the story of the Jesuit patcher, hidden the family of Darrell during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in whom the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is represented by his own burial, having filled a coffin with stones (a discovery that was dug out later than its coffin).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen pizzle gauner to be, still debts and money for things that they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell's men who married their young women - I got married to me as a bunch of good looking guys, with a talent to acquire him within. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes on the search for other unique scribe experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has given a two-week stay in the Finnish wild for a comic-novel about Elonghomäki to the area of a gentleman in the early 20th century, which has been demanded from nature again by nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year in Ankara, the Upper Military Council (YAS) advises over retirement and disorders in the officer level.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So this week also.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine during the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting did not take place in the Staff of Staff, as early as early as the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">To the consultations, under the presidency of the regime, the five vice premacy and the Minister for Defence, Inneres, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus civilians were in the midst of the YAS.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government moves the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the host, the Air Force and the Navy were removed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup it has fired the Erdogan Erdogan 169 of the 326 generals and Admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually due to alleged connections to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen who sees the Erdogan as a wire of the coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2349">There are 486 people who are directly involved in the coup attempt at hand, is negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup attempt, Erdogan had referred to the overthrow as "God's gift, as he give him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan have really put the army in a grip?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen" in the military headquarters. "</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the Staff of the "Islamization" of the army, the army that manifests itself in the abolition of the headscarf ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The big cleaner in the army and security forces is continuing.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July Erdogan sent another 7395 heads of government agencies, among them 2303 policemen and 546 female soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed, when Erdogan was narrated to the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals used to be the country's real gentlemen.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times putsches they on their role as a guard of the secular state regime.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election in 2002, Erdogan pressed the power of the military to step by step, not least on appeal for the reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say, Erdogan drivers deliberate an Islamic synthesis of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe", "Vocal Europe" warned not an accurate officer who searched for asylum from fear of persecution in foreign countries asylum, and the Turkish army will be "full of extreme extremists and oafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">One meets this, that the Nato could not be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">After the purification of the Turkish army, there is no doubt in the purification of the Turkish army.</seg>

<seg id="2369">The bill is to be debated in the two chambers of the Congress.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"this law will decrease poverty, wages & raise $billion dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the US as the citizens of other countries' Green Cards."</seg>
<seg id="2371">The law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system.</seg>

<seg id="2373">MV wants to accelerate stretch for race shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">In recent months over the past few months, the future of the race car had been controversial - now it should go very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year it is due to the marodes track which drives the tourist railway.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race-growing long-term, according to the transport technology, construction work is scheduled to start this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to order and to reorder the distance of Ilmenau-racehas, the country knows that above all for tourism," said traffic authority Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">In total, the country surpass 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future, will not be voted to declare.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the southern railway, as operator, are already in the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"the timetable, which are used by vehicles and standards of quality," said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned agreement between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This should be ordered the race-on Shuttle in December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The racig shuttle is primarily for tourists popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennes.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months in the course of a pilot plant, we have been using enough many people to order it again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also strongly dilapidated in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry us</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robot is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor for Robotik and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of FRR, we have to start taking seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipples and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people make them funny, but the company deliver a lot of it, and we will get them more likely to see, saying, Mr Sharkey said in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex pubs have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions which can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robot directly to his beliefs, "and choose from the eye-color of the robot on the shape of nipples to the type or color of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there is still worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" which would make a progressive woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex pubs have developed to robots with a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its robots to the properties that they are appealing how relapsing.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," giving the impression of "Frigid Farrah" and "Wild Wendy" with an adventurous personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible," warmed the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So, you may like what you like, and they don't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has its moods - as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood." "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troubled aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least, because they recognise real human relationships, but the underpageous female characteristics, if one go a step on Frigid (this: resisting) farms, perserene one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it is called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, this sex robot is not just a table or just another sex player.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement prove something dark and depths in our culture, on a return from the gender equality and a desire to sex with submission to an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will obviously hold no sex robot, while the FRR will notice her ascending popularity, but remain temporary at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is pertinent from the edge zones, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, could be very educational.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting, until they are the free market for the permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain divorce that this highly developed sex-robot immersed in a time in which the rights of women are threatened around the world, who in the White House is a President that has gulled to have sexually attacked women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the worn out body and the chaired eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots consists to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar Proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder, they want themselves to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, if it comes to the point when it comes to their "personalities, robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companions or easily.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They don't have a mediation or background story, lack of independence or anything that may disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">You expressed different: they are pretty slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redeposition of 2017: maid services</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is become a binoculars in the trump era, that the political divisions have been polarized, also divided families in small formats.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Ernest there were in the USA papers concerned with advice on how to reverse folds with horror of trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all suppose to reject our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, an left-directed poet, who has lived in Chicago and has long been visiting the Republican in our family that week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity can have a powerful enemy on a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone is familiar, including the republican relationship, with which she fought for decades because of its policy, suddenly and quite strange at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls in a further context that this brings considerable risks to itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the adjusting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the charity of us that his kittens will no longer be topped.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a long-term long-term scenario, in which Trump's Republicans of the Right wing "normalizes," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as epitome of extermination.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's uronic version of the recompence - the dog on the Autodach, which looked at 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - which occur in comparison to trump in fact one of very mild strains.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritual to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the New York's park department, and the best three dollars which you can spend in the city, if there is no caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are tremendous large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are brightly and the animals turn off to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extreme dark and climatic music arranges this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many lichés of a city disappoint: the views from high buildings are old, the Skylines are to be familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not righteous.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm not all over the day, when I found that Swiss Cottage is certainly not a Swiss Cottage that is not one of the topics - the topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one of the roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, central park carousel is still a strange magical experience since two two years old, a 11 year old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">When I could assess Karusel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody had asked afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before using my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee shop on the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option, the evaluation by a 15% tip of tip - this is to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excuse grinning, while I get tired of the experience, you got my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius relocated with chest pain from prison in the hospital</seg>

<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of an appeal against Morning after an appeal against the government.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine's Day in 2013 by calling them through a door to the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software Update for Diesel Cars: what You Need To Know now</seg>
<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve the emission of emission of Euro 5 and partially Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action compulsory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the licensed software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the obligatory updates previously accepted only for the vehicles, the Schuman software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofitting has arranged the KRAFTFLIGHT-Bundesamt (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customer inform about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">Manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the next few months, but still no precise appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has communicated to attribute every female concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If any inspection should be due, it will be done in their framework.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long could the equilances move in total?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"difficult to say," says Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The appendices of the commitment of the manufacturers and from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen what voluntarily take care of the car manufacturers to date so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself could last for three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time consuming must be to receive an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers do that do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE will be waiting for.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Presumably, foreign manufacturers would move, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is a massive price drop of Euro-4 cars now?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE was fears that way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But just in the regions, where drivers threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2519">In rural areas there is no securities in older diesel so far.</seg>
<seg id="2520">The ACE will behave to wait with an sale still.</seg>

<seg id="2522">Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2523">The first prize in President Trump promises to be political.</seg>
<seg id="2524">One of the winners will not come - from protest.</seg>
<seg id="2525">LL Cool J (49) gets the first Rapper one of the prestigious Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="2526">As the tubing was announced on Thursday also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavorade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).</seg>
<seg id="2527">Prizes will be handed over in early December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Traditionally, U.S. president Donald Trump is organised a reception and together with his wife Melania.</seg>
<seg id="2529">Due to the progressive TV series, announced laureates Lear announced this reason to declare participation in the gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">The "New York Times," he said, "This presidency has decided to relocate the arts and human rights, even the resources - and burdens me."</seg>
<seg id="2531">The 59-year-old Estefan stressed, she will use the conversation with Trump to clear her view.</seg>
<seg id="2532">After the former president John F. Kennedy named Kennedy-Zentrum, the largest cultural unit in the U.S. capital.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Among the previous prizees, Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.</seg>
<seg id="2534">We do the city viable</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haselachs Stadtbaumeister, goes to Rente in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - suitable candidate are however rar.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister since 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as he did in the press discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2539">It reports varied, but even demanding tasks that wait for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time admires him that no application is ERELLLE the required profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city searches an architect or design engineer at the closest point.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - under the slaughter of the regular notice of notice - still enough time to elaboration.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach was acting for the administrative community as Untere Building Authority, the applicants must be appropriate to the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city definitely.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they can't refill out this, citizens would have to drive advice until Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But civil servants be important to him, says Wacker that reports from a good company lima as well as good spirits between the authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have had to look back on the hackers with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2549">But in the future, varied projects are set up in the agenda: the design of the former bokla area and the low-hop park can be reached.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium renovation is still a theme.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone is smashing with some 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Rackers Racker.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design is available for a Stadtbaumaster large room.</seg>
<seg id="2555">It can be flexibly reacted with Haschachs's own building and gardener.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move much," hackers, and the design of the green plants will often be imposed by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the Old Town stands as a Ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have "one eye to have approved," if new buildings are approved, emphasizes the exemplating urban development.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the Stadtbaumeister carries high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is the building owner, "at the end, everything runs through my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">At his supervision and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in charge for ten years with Manfred Schöner (underground) for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also that his successor is long, Wacker says, "we are looking for someone who really want to be identified and want to stay."</seg>
<seg id="2562">For continuity, not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further creation of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Whoever wants to syllable Roland Wacker, should have a degree in architecture or Bachelor with field of architecture and have a good knowledge of knowledge in the areas of construction and construction plan.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Stadtbauamt understands high and deep construction, building planning, groundwork opportunities, Municipal countensions with building farm and urban gardening as well as Untere Building Authority including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bike to lines cast: southern railway line blocked</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to police, the previously unknown valleys at the railway gliding across the Leozen street (B116) had thrown into the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so heavily damaged, that the hard move had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go from two male valleys and are looking for the night hours after them.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the crime, witnesses of a rosé shaped roller and a bike riders were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"that goes far beyond a Lausbubenich," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA.</seg>
<seg id="2571">The valleys also had taken themselves in great danger and also endangered by train.</seg>
<seg id="2572">Besides the damage to the locomotive and the plant and the delay of rail transport, pönes of rail clients could also be increased to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">A total of "considerable" sum, "said the spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damages were fixed on Friday afternoon, the railway service could be run on the south route without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">One day, Friday morning were unattended, two of them mainly concerned correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Goods, however, did not tumult, but they had delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB speaker, Christoph Posch had to be exchanged around 200 metres of outlines.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Isolators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (Flammable disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The immoral condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States, caused masters and blows, recurring or bloody confusion, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those concerned, meat and dairy products normally rode to relieve their symptoms, researcher at the Washingtoner University, found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells, which promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna explained that Immune cells in the intestinal patrol make sure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in food, do not penter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, disable, inflammation are compensated by cells, promote tolerance, and protect the body without damaging the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an anti-inflammatory bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a kind of tolerance for the immunity was found in mice, which contribute to a particular bacterium in its bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more Tryptophan had the mice of their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He proposes that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition is tolerated, less anti-inflammatory collapses if the same system also act with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral thesis Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune system that had found a group of study sites such cells, but another group of the same tribal, but that was not separate.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It is assumed that the difference in the intestinal symptoms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi who normally live in the stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were DNA sequences and were found in six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells, but lacking mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were brought up in a sterile environment, so they lacked a Darmmikrobiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were formed the reupti and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria break out to the immune system, the researchers increased L. reupti in a fluid and then overthrew small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe Immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The Immune cells developed to the tolerance eligible cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan metabolism that is known as an Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubling the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice increased by around 50 per cent, but when the tryptophanes were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant substruction cells, such as mice, and protect most of us L. reuteri in our mages.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known to develop whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri develop the cells of people like in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote these cells emerge on the inside surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially can lead high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri lead to a population of this population. "</seg>
<seg id="2604">Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "Genie"</seg>
<seg id="2605">At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic has signed a "Genie", Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder on Wednesday evening his debut at Sampdoria.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last season-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins, and impressively in the frame role as the people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira in popularity.</seg>
<seg id="2607">However, Matic was excluded from the pre-preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed to improve Mourinho since he had to improve Mourinho before beginning of the Premier League 2012 season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the nature, how he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"we will help him to be ready later than later."</seg>
<seg id="2610">In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva stadium in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho will be the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Independent unveiled during this week, that Mourinho might wish three other new engagements but he had already shown that the club has already done a "fantastic work" with three of his four stages of new engagements.</seg>
<seg id="2612">"for three of four, thank you to the association," he added.</seg>
<seg id="2613">"I will be happier if you have received four of four, but they have given great effort."</seg>

<seg id="2615">The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilots flew Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dreamliner about the U.S., which are several thousand kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="2617">The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.</seg>
<seg id="2618">On the radar screen was the shape of a Dreamliner.</seg>

<seg id="2622">New draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">Like the wind twisted: as Sigmar Gabriel was one of the SPD chief, in retrospect, social democratic prime minister before elections were always with a certain concern to Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Just no worrfire from the party escape, no headwind from the covenant - so was the most important wish of the choice.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz has led the profoundly altered.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then the employee of the Willy-Brandt-Haus with growing resolution illustrate the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What has been given from there since the beginning of the year, with counterwind not been described in the approach.</seg>
<seg id="2628">It was deep advice.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And indeed one by another.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU also sees a generic signal to Koalitions of SPD and Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this once again shows more: red-green can simply regate," said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprisingly fractionist of a green deputies made the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the mountain pole, its red-green coalition took their votes to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Greens-President Michael Kellner challenged the abtrusive Dutch nationality Elke Tows to withdraw his mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The resignation of the CDU means a clear elimination of voters.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Tthwest must immediately return to her mandate, "said the Federal Finance and Choice of the Greens of the Green editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"it may not be true all true," she sighed as the Friday morning, as Friday morning, the new Hiobsbotanhood reaches the party headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD Minister President of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU green defleets of the CDU without its own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional climax of a whole rows of large and small crises in SPD-factories.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland's election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, no longer, reassuring the comrains at a time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">This then became - and indeed everything was much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The SPD in Kiel brought the SPD to the Taube, the Düsseldorf-Pleite carried out the party smooth.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrayed the comrades in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then when they had shamed up new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And the next deep came with him.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Landeschef, lost his Nimbus in the weekend, because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burnt.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in the crisis-communication well done anything wrong, which one can make wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW-exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board of Saxony-Saxon prime minister has been in the criticism since longer.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Obese conversion values came in.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Anyway, or maybe in the past few weeks, Weil tried to get stronger in the covenant of accents.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The taxation of the former mayor from Hannover to building his power in Berlin was not concealed by Martin Schulz as well.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They left him as they promised by pastil a stabilization of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There is no guilt of the lower Saxon nature in the grave of the lower internal forums.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz are not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">While the comraises decides, the comrades shifts to keep its own ranks.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Your wrath is based on the Greens, and here especially to the lowered parliamentarian supervests.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democracy digression regarding the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party collapses in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Ms. Trucks is not elected for its person as a direct canter, but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Parliament, so the saxonian deputies are continuing.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thomas Oppermann, Chief of the SPD parliamentary group, complains an "undemocratic maneuver."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the voters of four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony as the tip of the parliamentary elections, the RND.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"now, the personal career of CDU deputies hit the election result," said Oppermann. "</seg>
<seg id="2669">He ordered to clarify the backgrounds.</seg>

<seg id="2671">Sponsors for the Ortlers III</seg>
<seg id="2672">Those who want to be repaired in the years can be forwarded by the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In this informal Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEC urban development on Wednesday in Empfingen.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review to the date.</seg>
<seg id="2675">It has been in Employee areas since 1991.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg has been taken over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the hitherto the hitherto renovation project "- it is finally important to promote the inner development, and not only new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the ruling class Karlsruhe that it will give a renovation area of III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros from the country, the remainder of the commune of Empfingen.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is there a rehabilitation solution?</seg>
<seg id="2682">You will find so Schindler, to investigate where the "really old houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it plays a role whether in the planned area there are interest of existing, to be rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area should be shifted again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The STEC Treaty on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Cellar presents the contents of the federal state programme "Social City," in whose framework the renovations would then be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program are the vitalising of interior capitals, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures are based on objects, which means for each plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Then the rehabilitation zone finally would eventually set as a statutes.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The authorisation period for funding has been running since 1st January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September of this year, only once again the inventory would be carried out, under those who are involved in the rehabilitation areas involved a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the statutes should be made to begin next year with the renovations.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then declared that each commune could perform the accused of investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is therefore to rate the urban abuse and to decide when it is rehabilitated and in which scope.</seg>
<seg id="2695">For the respective plot a sanitary facility will also be entered in the basic book.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come again to Empfingen and get a picture of the situation, promised them.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel stressed, a major success factor for the project was the participation of the parties involved.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be a questionnaires, which can be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "building and building of the building, with which it goes among others by constructional condition and refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="2700">The grey questionnaire, the "household and housing", can be done according to size, division, and residents of a room.</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "" "" "" "" "" "" "can only be filled when the building areas are operated.</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, Gotzel denied it, that a full questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">Furthermore, new construction works are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler stressed that the distribution of conveyors according to the "Windund principle" functional - who first comes, warns first.</seg>
<seg id="2705">They could not be booked a promoter for later. "</seg>
<seg id="2706">In the end there were still photos of the project "Ortlerern II" to make the reason a refurbishment. "</seg>

<seg id="2918">The wide majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also depicts him as a "warm hearty," "popular", "sincerely," competently "and" intelligently "," competently "and" understanding, and "always assisted by cakes, biscuits and Bonbons."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his PERFEKTIONISM and its high emotion which led to blackouts too.</seg>
<seg id="2920">He did not only poke with the chairs and the keys and on the ground, but also eared and too freak guys in the hair or ears, he has already sought to profoundly and apologize for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, honoring salvation, however, it must be said that such appearance methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, have been widespread, with parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everybody was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually is in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse, and violent violence in the preschool, the friend of Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it's not more about his notice and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI's brother, that many media had straight on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, in connection with the report a lot about abuse has occurred in the Domrburger's cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger occurs in the final report as well as related or sympathy with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not only the 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to be familiar with the cathedral master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to speak with my father or mother," said one concerned representing the others, "There was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem at lightenment of sexual abuse has been and is that most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they hired not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral teacher, but professional had been a colleague of the valleys.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the pupils Ratzinger's role in regard to misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragile student formulated this way: "in respect of sexual abuse... I see... no fall in which he would have had to know the findings and the respective offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that... Buying an urgent or clearer or rather reopened as compared to their parents, Internatural teachers, trustteachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2942">So, sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of every sympathy.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be thrown out, nor put it to be prevented or displaying.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradictive crime, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, a lot of "violations" should be appearing in the Domrburger's cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The earlier cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is being thrown out of the "Trail" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that was mixed and blended with a huge melange from sexual abuse and violations, and in the middle of the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is clean as clean: between the preschool and the gymnassion of Domdonatzen, between sexual abuse, and violations, and say, we say, Other Andifen.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report incidents in the period since 1945, i.e. out of four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger did not master the conductor of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All horrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys of savial teachers were regularly cleared and underlined, and underwent all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where there were really skandal states have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he had only been able to face the boys when they were already looking at the DomTreat school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">Anyway, like most of the witnesses, the subject "School" taboos.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to come to her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradigian" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the school's dominion?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but there was no savial violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, during the conclusion of the conclusion that there are many sacrifices of humanity by R. SCHEIVES and therefore, in numerous cases, even more positive memories of him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">And he still remains the forefuse of having stowed away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two timespaces in which the states have been reported on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to revive and took part in its predecessor, at which he did not work and was, (so the witness) didn't want to hear, and then again until 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Will Georg Ratzinger believed in front of the conditions consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the school of Domasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this he says that in the preschool, it continues to be practiced. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already given the danger of negative press releases he was urgent urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Of course, it was at a time when legal clarification was to be banned in Bavaria as an inspector.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before they started in a lawful grey zone, as each one knows how to know us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to conclude that the affected may have been overdone or dramatised, and where really the maximum limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can not say, he would have always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test was only officially abolished in Bavaria in 1980 and officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted yes, it is unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are speaking of historians about the "snare of Anachronism," therefore the danger of today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was torn to all times and also not for what is broken in preschool and violence against innocent children's secondary education, that goes far beyond that was retired.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I'm glad that it is finally finished.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for discipline and punishment, thus in the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment he was forbidden, he has kept strictly respected.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The image of his rainy season, Georg Ratzinger took to you in the talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject to inspect in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: now, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI., told about his perspective, as the cathedral capture only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Despite this, I woe not at all that he led a stringent regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this must be said, without these PERFEKTIONISM, without having unconditional Discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world transplant, real cultural botanings of Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight twice to the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, one does not make any major singers and from every success, right on which area, but always discipline, passion and self overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As for a man, you have seen George Ratzinger in their book at the talks?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesman: through his work on the book and beyond that, I have learned Georg Ratzinger, and always experienced a wonderful, humorous, trusted, deep believers, deep believing and hearty.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I go regularly with how many former domain don't use today, 23 years after its Emerging, regularly contact him, he is close to him - he is almost blind and they treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who are not forgiven to him by now, that he was once more strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domains are grateful today, because he enriches their lives and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, väternal teacher - a strenger father, certainly it may be - but also a lieu reprosper, to whom they still look up and keep them straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, even more clearly, all that one accuses him, are education methods that were then on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long ago overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man only because he is prominent and a even more prominent brother to make the medial sinner.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil purpose that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report which was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now it would be entitled to buy a 93-year old man who has acquired great merits and probably from outside Bayerns and perhaps one of Germany nobody would have to know any of the Rainsburger DomdonÂ "in peace.</seg>
