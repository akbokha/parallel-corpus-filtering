Jenn@@ ifer An@@ ist@@ on : I will always put in drawers .
Jenn@@ ifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
that Hollywood star has clearly understood the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;ve always put in drawers , or put it on the outside of the label which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I do not have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe &quot; to me . &quot;
Jenn@@ ifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only lau@@ gh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ it@@ an &quot; in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ it@@ an . &quot;

Gol@@ fer Langer receives the mini @-@ pyram@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer , from some colleagues , sought a little variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CHI@@ O : &quot; gold Sport@@ p@@ ids &quot; for Bernhard Langer
after a few minutes the horses had remember@@ ed their ceremony , they pursued in the fast Gal@@ opp home to the food .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Langer .
and then the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again .
on Saturday &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 victories - back to horse@@ back .
he left himself with his family about the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he sw@@ allowed not to take pictures .
long was the first time in Aachen , and thereby also at CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convinc@@ ing .
the German sports aid transl@@ ates out the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small g@@ ala the golden sport p@@ iles .
in 2013 , the like@@ able sport@@ s@@ men are not lack@@ ing .
Bundes@@ ver@@ scienti@@ ous Cross , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ zel , Champions Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has grown him already .
the 18th winner of the young pyram@@ ids .
in Aachen he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot , &quot; says Langer , &quot; for it will not only be awarded for sporty achie@@ vements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
since decades , Langer sponsored worldwide .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 Euro to the same .
with 15 more outstanding athletes , the two @-@ level ma@@ sters were recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
after the excellent includes the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmitt , who is Turner Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , der Ju@@ oka Frank Wien@@ ek@@ e , the jumping vine , Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the manual Erhard .
many of these sporting events were coming to Aachen on Saturday .
according to the official part , the illustr@@ ative society arri@@ ves in the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ azza Award ran .
Bernhard Langer lasted far to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and sl@@ ump &apos;s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest@@ ing in infrastructure and prevent the TT@@ P trade agreement - they want to get both Clinton and tr@@ ump .
but the two US pre@@ sidential seek@@ ers are subject to the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is one fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small , war@@ ns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton turns to death and regul@@ ate the economy and says to death , he says .
he himself would be completely different to Tr@@ ump .
he will be able to mas@@ sively back regul@@ ating , and it is strong for a wide control ar@@ ises with lower tax sets strong - for private persons and companies .
Clinton &apos;s commitment says : the state has to ful@@ fill specific tasks , it has not@@ ified opportunities and needs money .
therefore the tax would be increased for the rich , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the m@@ ills we will invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost literally .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic and democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
so on Tr@@ ump , we could get in @-@ internal discussions .
distinc@@ t are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tr@@ ump will build coal plants and drive coal equipment in the US again .
oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas that I want to cancel the Paris climate agreement .
in contrast to an investment programme , Clinton will explic@@ it@@ ly aim to build the renewable energies and create : &quot; a country will create the power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even for international trade agreement the two oppon@@ ents are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ az@@ if@@ ical trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both the U.S. would not want to isol@@ ate from international trade - but simply by American jobs .
they should then be paid even better for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of USD 7.@@ 25 is a hungry wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what is what is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage is r@@ ins@@ ing , then he says he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the upcoming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on one side , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to sp@@ lash growth .
his crit@@ ics hold him before , thus the budget defic@@ it would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , at least one of the king@@ doms , wants to pay more taxes , and their crit@@ ics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every dre@@ aming woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost already for everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house provides refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each has a baby , which is at the most one year old .
one has laid her small son in the arms .
he looks curious in the space with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tabl@@ et@@ op .
until they noticed that it is observed .
they sm@@ iles short and k@@ iss@@ ed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
to work with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , one carrier for social hel@@ pers in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are escap@@ ed .
in the Munich north you live in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the facility with Pro Famil@@ ia and Munich Women &apos;s Rem@@ edy .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are polit@@ ically prosec@@ uted for them or death , because their families are threat@@ ened to send them as a hope of hope to Europe . &quot;
in females we@@ igh other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in their hom@@ eland they have experience with sexual violence , ken@@ nel , hon@@ orary mor@@ als , sla@@ very or compulsory institutions .
this moves her .
the way goes on .
&quot; that , for example , demand for a bottle of water such sexual act is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as she arrived in Germany , says B@@ ahr .
even here , all women in refugees would often be considered as infer@@ ior to infer@@ ior and worse ones .
this leads to about 90 percent of women who dwell in the residence in the Munich &apos;s north , trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women were used so that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; or they dare not dare to speak open@@ ly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they are often not going to help , then I need more accommodation only for them , called B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district ran@@ kings are responsible for the establishment of refugees .
on the question if they are using a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction of life , answers some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such a thing in the governments of governments .
even in the Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , women are not inhabited separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press ram of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken are available in some joint size floors or own homes for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
the Committee &quot; Rights of women and gender equality has also been ur@@ ged in the European Parliament that women must be divided separately from men .
in a study which was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separate . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or become affected by men and women , there may be - ongoing - violence against women . &quot;
specially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
as if the women feel like this , you can read the in@@ gest@@ ion that there are on the house in Munich .
&quot; have been around since it has been talking about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could easily make a second house .
assistance methods : demands for new business amp@@ f@@ tions
dep@@ uty of the Assist@@ ants have called their union in order to appro@@ ve new jobs in their disp@@ utes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has dem@@ anded its entire Council from the beginning of September more working measures .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been saying goo@@ db@@ ye to respon@@ d to the wor@@ r@@ ying of the contract .
assistance medi@@ aries and physician assist@@ ants have been voted in July via the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said that the government would have remained difficult to have problems that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has provided a formal application for a special meeting of BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of es@@ cal@@ ating work@@ stations which begin in early September .
the disp@@ utes ar@@ ising that , in the history of N@@ HS , the first overall fail@@ ures were carried out in the history of N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Registr@@ ar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , joined the agreement for re@@ jection of the agreed agreement , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assistant physician and medical inst@@ ances , with that the contract should be advant@@ age@@ ous and accepted .
after the vote , the health minister Jeremy H@@ unt told that the contract for physi@@ ci@@ ans in England would be forced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of external suppliers &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to decl@@ are his hands and pro@@ claimed an official end of the aged eight months and pro@@ claimed the wars of economic sanc@@ tions .
but when Vladimir Putin with@@ drew his Turkish counter@@ part in the g@@ ild@@ ed room of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I can &apos;t miss that Ankara &apos;s reconc@@ ili@@ ation will fail .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin sm@@ iles really sm@@ iled and it was hardly heat , even for its re@@ stra@@ ined conditions .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an said to be repeated by his &quot; dear Friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also spoke that relations with Russia could not only be able to return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day actually described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an would have thought more than would never happen something worst .
my enthusi@@ asm seemed to me rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the Russian state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather the cause of the crisis was the first to mention in its introduction : the de@@ position of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin returned and accused Ankara to his back in the back .
the deal was even bigger , as it was committed by a conf@@ ident friend .
the pack &apos;s pack is difficult to build , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media guided a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed to bear the Turks for everything that bear bl@@ ame .
the serious complic@@ ations of gu@@ iding po@@ ins@@ men that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syri@@ ans from the so @-@ called Islamic state .
he has question@@ ed this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting just took place because Putin got the exc@@ use of President Erd@@ og@@ an who he wanted to hear .
Russia could reserve a sort of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an ar@@ mist@@ ice are clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is primarily interested in all friends who can get in after last month &apos;s coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at almost his am@@ ending .
repeated terror@@ ist attacks on Turkey also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic mot@@ ives .
Russian sanc@@ tions have hit Turkey - especially the prohib@@ ition of charter flights , each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish Coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia tour operators and other regional companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be res@@ umed .
they are on a late seas@@ onal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the national television sen@@ ti@@ est fruits and vegetables predic@@ ts once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes , long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is mad at the West since its reaction to the tried to look for a weak response .
to do this , the ongoing gro@@ ves of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which makes it out , out of the cool tuning benefits and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian President of Russian won a bonus in Ankara with security that he called for the elected coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a self @-@ intellig@@ ible for Moscow , which itself has a deep f@@ righ@@ tening of fear .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace made it in Russia and Turkey , one as it gave me an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of Foreign Charac@@ ters &quot; : two countries based on the west and feel bad and now ign@@ ite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconc@@ ili@@ ation , there are still considerable differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow gave up the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but Russia and Turkey supporting each other .
it could be stri@@ k@@ ingly , that after almost three hours first , both President had pron@@ oun@@ ced the press conference at the press conference that they could not even say this subject .
the president of Turkey abandoned it to answer a question about their differences , and Putin decided to bet@@ s this .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about that , where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of host@@ ilities - and in view of the Pot@@ en@@ zi@@ as for a perfect disaster , when NATO member is Russian fighting jet , it is certainly better that the two heads will speak at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the CEO R@@ BS , the Bank will only be reduced to a Back@@ office role , according to the manager of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan signed the BBC Scotland , that the R@@ BS brand were linked to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
since then the Bank has been dist@@ anced , almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
in this time brand ge@@ ons &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other consumer funds .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
all RS@@ B references , head@@ quartered in England and Wales , will change its headquarters and stock tra@@ its at Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private customers , which are more importance - Cout@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN has been inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland by : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be on our investment brand as well as to the brand , among which our employees work , since we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS was become a global brand .
now I say that we are not pursu@@ ing global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own con@@ greg@@ ations for something completely different and our employees will work among those brands .
R@@ BS already told that it will not continue to continue his Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of various brands in its sport spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the bank of brands , as we focus on in the inside ( we asked ourselves ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the board of the board .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical before three years , when we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched this brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can swing these brands again , so I think that the time is come .

Russia Putin mo@@ b Stab@@ y Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expected his rod minister of Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years of part of the close contact of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as special guest for environmental and transport opportunities .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin &apos;s recommendation is the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been the responsibility of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 was named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , former diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he made his conclusion to the renowned National Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website it is ( in Russian ) that he later became a Head of Head of the Head Office and Head of the government .
he said to Putin on his appointment , &quot; Th@@ ank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of government to support your activity as the State of State for Leg@@ isl@@ anders and controls .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor is recommended .
con@@ vince the faces of the faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious wo@@ unds .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time in Vladimir Putin &apos;s largest conf@@ identi@@ ality and works as he worked for the Soviet intelli@@ gence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
on a meeting with President Putin that was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men continued to withdraw his own request .
but despite the break@@ down for cameras , few of them are convinced - mainly , just before parliamentary elections .
so what &apos;s the result of a kind of struggle for ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once was pri@@ ved to forward as a potential president , on once the Russian environmental policy was to lead to great ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quot@@ ed on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation , I would almost say this very complicated Post@@ en - one could almost say - compl@@ ained for four years .
as it was out , I have been the President of the Russian Pre@@ sidential Council for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov participated in the post office in December 2011 .
prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin has a member of the K@@ GB state military service .
in the late 1990s , Putin was chairman of the B@@ und@@ essi@@ v@@ ical officer ( FSB ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
as Putin met the power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he tru@@ sted in most .
once Ivan@@ ov was once accepted to Putin &apos;s second term of office , since there could have a third term in Putin against the Constitution .
but this post was taken from another , seam@@ less ally Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became the president three and a half years later .

puzzles about f@@ ishes , land@@ ed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for the identification of the f@@ ishes help , who appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain th@@ inks that it could act with the 75 f@@ ishes around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were elev@@ ated by a fountain of fountain .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with loop
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017
Engine@@ ers have connected the North @-@ deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now connected to maturity .
it is the first of four closing of the &quot; ceiling fan , &quot; the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge piece from maturity is now 600 meters long and weighs just 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sl@@ av@@ ings .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Economy Minister Ke@@ ith Brown took a visit to the site today and was one of the first who walked the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbo@@ lic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings .
we are all witnesses of an ic@@ onic art of an truly ep@@ ic measurement in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the lift between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bri@@ dging can be found at their place and the last stretch of deck@@ s today in Ros@@ y@@ th gets a hole for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted by the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high and deep construction represents this fantastic project .
after installing the last street cover and its connection with the present north tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap in the northern or country side .
this was reached via pul@@ ling the northern fe@@ eder bridge of 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to reach up to a slope of about 3 % .
he@@ ik@@ el , as the toler@@ ances , which the team work , were tiny - on every side they were just a few milli@@ meters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything went very well .
res@@ cu@@ ing in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men still have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
three men still have &quot; luck to be alive &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of An@@ gles@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI Res@@ cue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ St Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had problems to swim in safety while you pass the boat from their own power .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around to himself and placed us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already woven the boat out of their reach , until we left to water , &quot; added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found in a boat without life@@ jacket .
they arrived all on board the coastal slope and were brought back to rescue station
Mr Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , is lucky to be in@@ ju@@ red and still alive .
the boat engine had a stop plug , but these dissolved itself in the bo@@ re@@ th of the boat from the person without the boat .
som@@ eb@@ ody asked about this men today .
seriously in@@ ju@@ red - man st@@ ills on his ex @-@ friend a
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and in@@ ju@@ red .
as the police shared yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to get his personal things .
instead of the in@@ tox@@ ised tattoo the clothing of his ex @-@ friend .
when this came to the apartment , he twice moved to them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ ju@@ red at hand and in the body .
the police allowed the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ friend he called his mother .
this al@@ arm@@ ies became his sister .
together with their hab@@ itat , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to re@@ ass@@ ure their brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with their lives .
on the road they met the ex @-@ lifetime of the man .
when the two women bet@@ ray the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old girl bet@@ ray his sister and grab@@ bed his ex @-@ friend .
who is building Braunschwe@@ ig@@ s favor@@ able apartments ?
the SPD and Grü@@ ne mean : investors still should be taken too much stronger in the duty .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 affordable housing in the next few years ?
the SPD propos@@ es a &quot; stor@@ ation concept &quot; for the next meeting .
but battle is programmed .
the first line goes around the question : who should build the affordable housing ?
a provision is missing so far .
SPD parliamentary party , Christoph grav@@ mann says : &quot; we &apos;re with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas is to show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments . &quot;
the affordable housing can however also be developed in its hol@@ dings .
the Hall of the Town Hall was , however , as a br@@ at@@ man : &quot; how are you going to build investors in private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but as soon as 20 percent of dwell@@ ings as social dwell@@ ings . &quot;
a new Municipal residential building programme , which will cost millions , will be funded , and will provide for inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , so fr@@ ying : &quot; there is no agreement between the fr@@ actions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules .
the Left plans for investors still for investors .
regardless of that , so , the story of the situation based on the housing market is dis@@ regarded .
the action concept will be implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the building management process .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear if we will get the staff .
yet the programme is not entirely different : because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway .
but how does the loss of more about 1300 affordable housing results , whose funding will be exp@@ ecting over the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planetary spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now .
in addition , this would have to be thought about to recover ship@@ ments again .
this is possible in the West city .
to one stroke the problem can be solved .
because in the West city walk to the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the cost of affordable housing .
only : this does not want the owners who do not use housing companies .
because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the West city is dra@@ st@@ ically increased , one can be removed from the target of the so @-@ called inter@@ ference .
a concentration of social weak in only a few cities should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot;
this is focused on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a com@@ promise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting after health and happiness , worth it worth it
it is am@@ az@@ ingly to see how the world is changing .
that teen@@ agers and child can &apos;t go out anymore but rather you prefer to spend their free time , on monitors to rigid , was su@@ ing in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go it is about to get people from the sofa and allow to be active .
the time on screen was at the beginning on TV , then limited to video games and at least on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and activities are not facing each other .
of course I cli@@ cked on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s ( later it developed a string series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phen@@ om@@ ena of pop culture came to the interest of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go again had more users than tiny and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in brief , the players go outside with their smartphones to search outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that have been tr@@ acked with a GPS as soon as they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( on a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game , when she was still younger , decided to get the tap and sp@@ rang the couch for the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person rest each day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35@@ .000 users passed by the Washington Post shortly before launching the number of people followed by 45 percent every day , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for power upgrade .
many public ex@@ plan@@ ations for health , people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the sofa &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day actively eng@@ aging in his ears , because many public messages are boring in the health and they come from people coming to the end .
nevertheless , the meaning of sports may not be reviewed yet .
those who are regularly sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or de@@ pression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
therefore , three pillars of health cover@@ ings - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people join the h@@ unt even new friends .
as always there is also m@@ ür@@ ric play der@@ ives that must always compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has been a break@@ through .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow earlier our activity , they gave us no reason to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate how to do this game .
new will lose its appeal and the use is ref@@ illed with time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activity will be divided into the real world and help many people to be ch@@ ase , active , f@@ itter , and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the ling@@ erie
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all of it .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ ort@@ less on the bar .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
in full line brilliant .
and now the Olympic champion finally .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday , the gap between himself and the rest of the world , and the rest of the world before all eyes are under the head@@ lamp of the Olympic Games .
its total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ a@@ ill@@ iter@@ er and &quot; final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ pas@@ c@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze man med@@ alli@@ er in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro 2016 , Brazil , the women of the Olympic Games in the art of art at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro 2016 , Brazil .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American leader , winning a combined event , and a altogether the fifth , while they had their reputation to be the best of its generation or even at all .
she collap@@ sed in te@@ ars when their final score was showed , and her long journey was found at this moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps who brought up their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals so that they contain a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou femin@@ on said that she was &quot; the best gymn@@ ast which I ever saw . &quot;
it was expected to take an last trial in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather than over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ ace her in gold and silver in the individual combined event of women in the art of art at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro , Brazil , Thursday , and won
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday during the f@@ are@@ well celebration that was retired in reti@@ rement in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a fore@@ word .
although Bil@@ es were on it , during their long road to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
a part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music , which would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no co@@ inc@@ idence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , adopted by co@@ ach@@ erin A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip during the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since summer 2013 , it has no longer lost all combined events , a si@@ eve , which becomes so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina has easily carried out through two fil@@ ings , tr@@ acked the image .
the ch@@ est@@ nut and the Bod@@ ins - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion title .
she returns again with 15,@@ 433 on the p@@ ig and sat down on the ground with 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ ac@@ ed her gently as she expected her end@@ age - and te@@ ars in Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that once was described in her sc@@ oring book .
the power of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a re@@ ven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a down@@ turn to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man cap@@ tains had called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; of Americans , a lead .
after their floor@@ standing , they cast their audience by their com@@ eback , over@@ whel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared without doubt .
as it concerns , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old of this week has a completely new meaning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ous in the car
according to the police report on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girls have been shot , which have been killed in one of the most dead@@ ly attacks of Phoenix during a decade , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Merkel liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12th as the car had been par@@ ked by the authorities .
the offen@@ ders fired eight con@@ uts from a fire@@ fire , while he arose on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another car to read in the report .
the police shared that the triple murder doesn &apos;t have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ ack@@ ers had not took the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took pos@@ session of an adult vic@@ tim .
the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting in the investigation has led to a closer look to whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
altogether , seven people were killed and two of them were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks .
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has been using several vehicles including one brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ator refused to reve@@ al the evidence that they are linked to the conclusion that the attacks have been linked and rob@@ bed of the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alised because of their in@@ jur@@ ies and died later .
Liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still in place .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was cut on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder , and was assumed that it was the work of the serial line .
the investig@@ ator found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and ensu@@ red a ball from the seat as well as a ball frag@@ ments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro @-@ ph@@ al@@ ies : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his age@@ ways , Edmund Micro@@ ce@@ ph@@ alie , the result of a genetic dis@@ order , did not know about his mother &apos;s Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought , I was not able to manage that .
I do not manage that .
after that I did not let me down .
what is not right at all , of course , let you let yourself drop . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her husband was shared that Edmund could never see her under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far so they beat him to inst@@ itutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I did not know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto .
Edmund can run with help of a hearing aid .
Edmund did not sit down until his third year &apos;s age , and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language , called Edmund for &quot; Please sing me something for me . &quot;
&quot; we recommend drawing to him , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical drawing - says she . Edmund has invented several characters alone .
Mikro@@ ze@@ ph@@ alie has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as inf@@ ections with viruses such as mas@@ ks or cy@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forec@@ asts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say as it is going to influence life with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus Inf@@ ant .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I did not ask about pro@@ gn@@ osis for a long time , because I do not expect someone can really tell me som@@ eb@@ ody else .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has created a hope@@ ful advice for moth@@ ers of babies with birth defects , which were caused by c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ding returns to rescue in Louis@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to call on Friday the emergency . the whole Saturday is reck@@ oned with more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the South @-@ east Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their bank and threat@@ ened with large floo@@ ding according to extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , reported the National weather service .
the Govern@@ or of Louis@@ iana John Bel Ed@@ wards ordered that state offici@@ als have already been travelling with local authorities and assistance to the communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emerg@@ ency Prepar@@ ed@@ ness of the Govern@@ ors , divided the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that the Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa &apos;s municipality would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system will be used over long parts in the South Louis@@ i@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service was rep@@ utable that an additional 3 to 5 inches may fall due to rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas , a flood warning system was employed on Friday , while in the area of Mobile continues .
the Com@@ ite river near B@@ aton R@@ oug@@ es and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , are all lik@@ el@@ i@@ hood after the weekend record level .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers might flo@@ ods many homes in the subur@@ bs near B@@ aton Rouge .
he also said that a thr@@ ust led in@@ spir@@ ing in Ascen@@ sion Par@@ ish a danger as it can only flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river ticket fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached on Friday at 0@@ 9.00 the highest level , ever recorded .
rescue team still boo@@ sted people from the floo@@ ding of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Le@@ Roy Han@@ s@@ ford , his wife and his ste@@ p@@ son found himself among those who were saved in the morning near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Han@@ s@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek is usually far more than 400 feet away from his house , rising rise overnight .
he told him a further step of step that dwell@@ eth in the clos@@ eness .
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and floo@@ ded the water , and floo@@ ded in , &quot; said Han@@ s@@ ford .
it got my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Ms. Han@@ s@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where they had never seen such a high level of the river .
Han@@ s@@ ford told that he and his family members had all the dis@@ abilities and the only one would swim .
Han@@ s@@ ford told that Not@@ hel@@ pers had saved all three in a major military truck and they had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated by Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flo@@ ods came quickly , &quot; because there was still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , and that authorities prevent ev@@ ac@@ uation assignment abroad into account .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ servers sent from live stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably dec@@ ep@@ ed through the ra@@ ining since Wednesday .
the authorities reported that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding residents from their houses in Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa par@@ ish and classes are caused in five debt collections .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a sub @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa p@@ ates 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the hab@@ it@@ ants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were both floo@@ ded .
the ruler of the church of Ro@@ bby Miller told that authorities were 72 people and seven pets were saved from the flo@@ ods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were furnished to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water begins to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa town , almost two do@@ zens of streets were closed due to the high water and back@@ packs for the residents that are ho@@ ping to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ ing from the City Council .
this seems to be a similar inc@@ ident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emerg@@ ency Manager told Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys that it remains on the Gulf coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses should be reported on Thursday as floo@@ ding , but on Friday there were no reported on Friday .
Ke@@ ith Town@@ son , manager at Sho@@ pper Value Foo@@ ds in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water at places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still happens . &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; crossed by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police divi@@ des that 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy died in Philadelphia , this week , the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child will be shot .
the gener@@ ators of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave me that Brown had several pe@@ aking viol@@ ations , including cr@@ ying , leg , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport into hospital with consciousness .
&quot; he has done so much , his little body was dissolved by bul@@ lets , &quot; ordered his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez , with the transmitter .
I simply do not believe this .
the boy was classified as a general hospital in a hospital , and he had to sett@@ le down several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that it is likely to be recovered .
he would have to start the first class in a local elem@@ entary school .
on brown , Brown was shot by four people die in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is found in a critical condition , was shot on the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car , and the police found out whether one of the last men of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors could find themselves .
investig@@ ators split C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several guns .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for the assault rif@@ le which have been trac@@ ed back to different storm@@ s , over@@ turned the crime .
it seems that it clearly happened at the struggle for a ongoing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the road , they found out envelope .
here , it seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; police @-@ author Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
there were also several buildings and vehicles in the territory .
there was no fixed , and the police inspec@@ tions currently exam@@ ines the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ table tennis r@@ acket , when she played before her house in the area of West Oak Lane .
she recovered himself and the police search for a susp@@ ects .
why we need to use Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I propos@@ e to myself in the Tur@@ ns at the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
first I started with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and second@@ ly , this team has three tur@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie , Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez , insp@@ ire for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish and Mad@@ ison K@@ oc@@ ian , the Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in is very proud .
this team finally reflec@@ ts the USA .
it has noted the black and H@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport art .
during the last four years the number one was one of the female family of A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ on were # 1 and # 2 .
this is showing strength .
for the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising conflict in America and America .
now the world was able to be the un@@ belie@@ vable achievement of the triple world championship by Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez , as it was un@@ expected , yet master@@ ed Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American leader , who won gold in an individual combined event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but not see tournament classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie succeeded in creating the same way as A@@ ly and Mad@@ ison to create it at the Olympic team .
they are the last five , because the next Olympic troops were only four tur@@ ers in the crew . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts a first line in private gymn@@ as@@ ium that are upright on the training , supervision , travel and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be solved at any time .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in we@@ al@@ thy subur@@ bs that can support the business .
in these verses , gymn@@ asts receive its overall workout and that is a expensive and long @-@ term engagement for families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez , have trained athletes have started her athl@@ ete since she started playing .
we have to insp@@ ire the municip@@ alities of Au@@ n count@@ less , young girls who will insp@@ ire by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easily accessible tournament .
I was founded my tournament company for 20 years .
for my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15.000 people ( mainly black and H@@ isp@@ anic ) and trains national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth of high quality models to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipl@@ ine and popular@@ ity for the spirit .
this combination offers life benefits for health and education and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , the thousands of young girls to be interested in Tur@@ ns and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Mad@@ ison for this true account of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Team and thank you for playing so many young girls with a different background to begin to begin healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors want to organize additional strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers were ho@@ ping to termin@@ ate the dis@@ pute over the changes due to a re@@ formed agreement with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ .000 assistant doctors that were elected at a choice .
in July H@@ unt plans reve@@ als the contract and said that N@@ HS would sett@@ le in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ ate@@ land &quot; contract , and any further delay for the staff and patients were harmful .
the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekends to improve car@@ n@@ ival times .
DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A comp@@ eting te@@ as for assistance don@@ ates discussed the proposed contract according to the proposed contract , in particular , that it can heat the current so@@ vereign debt crisis and to make it admin@@ istered to re@@ treat all doctors . &quot;
at only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group of doctors must fall under the new contract must progress made , and the time runs out .

this was the case of an appe@@ aling , Jeremy H@@ unt did not last month in the last month that his door would always open .
&quot; Jeremy H@@ unt has to act now , lift up the condition and wor@@ ry the wor@@ ries of the pract@@ iti@@ oner . &quot;
if he do not do this , so the Assist@@ ants have proved that they are ready to perform other work@@ stations .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operating systems , and 100.000 appoint@@ ments , because n@@ urses and medical doctors agreed to grant doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers were ho@@ ping to termin@@ ate the dis@@ pute over the changes through an acceptance of the re@@ formed Treaty with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to be a better storage re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the 54@@ .000 Assist@@ ants to sign the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , dem@@ anded the assistant to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; work amp@@ f@@ au@@ tions do not reach anything of the only little , but even more loaded teams and service providers and care the patient , f@@ ost@@ ers and their families only wor@@ ries , dist@@ ress and interru@@ ption . &quot;
during the last two months , we talked to the mit@@ ry of Assist@@ ance and respon@@ ds with the health ministry and other min@@ istri@@ es concerning the gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ars .

the t@@ inn@@ acle medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of recovered heart attacks for people with a her@@ ring dis@@ infection .
this medication is admin@@ istered for 12 months following a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .

some 14@@ 0.000 people suffer from a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strike are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty materials in the ar@@ ter@@ ial walls , which form the pads .

fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ gl@@ or in combination with A@@ spir@@ in is effective in the reduction of other cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ances and inc@@ idents in people who had already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend the possible treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from .

Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness lets pol@@ ling in Muslim areas
former may@@ or of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man has been taken out of government last year on the basis of a government report due to corru@@ ption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to that vast const@@ itution was ignor@@ ant in Muslim con@@ greg@@ ations as a de@@ cent government report today revealed .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric P@@ ickl@@ es , the police , dial ob@@ servers and Rath@@ es@@ tho@@ uses to have been ig@@ no@@ red by thre@@ ad@@ option of eth@@ nic@@ ity concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion .
the former minister of integration and commun@@ al government , who is now a anti @-@ Cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion@@ ig , said that the police would be allowed to have the police to protect bar@@ riers outside of electoral cabins , in order to protect rid of vot@@ ers .
he recommends that vot@@ ers should lead a identity with itself to prove their identity .
a vot@@ er must only call its name and address .
the report propos@@ es not to add removable ink on the finger of a person if they choose their voting rights to prevent som@@ eb@@ ody twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he propos@@ es that the press should have access to church records and decisions of non @-@ official comm@@ as or working parties .
&quot; this serves not only against voting , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the bro@@ ader corru@@ ption and finance industry , which he said : &quot; he said .
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s choice in eastern London .
last year a special selection court decided that the current Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should claim after a lit@@ any to corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ ending .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ su@@ cked the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; and that he would have had his crit@@ ics with rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ b@@ ien@@ an@@ ism .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious oblig@@ ation of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly or the result of a re@@ spiration , who sel@@ ects one person as someone else .
Sir Eric told that all the country was evidence for fr@@ aud .
in particular , he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent pre@@ sidential election - in which older members of Muslim community had had pressure on people , choosing one candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made more recommendations to clean the electoral system , including fo@@ unders of evidence to prove the identity
in its report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on requ@@ ier@@ y members of some ethnic min@@ or@@ ities were exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people in particular , according to the will of the Elder , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ical or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ islav background .
&quot; there was any concerns that ... state institutions such as such as &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; refle@@ ctions concerning the eth@@ nic@@ ism and religion could not be ig@@ no@@ red . &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ist letters were under@@ going , to stop &quot; suff@@ ices . &quot;
the report submitted by Ther@@ esa May will also be used to prevent har@@ der registration checks to prevent the electoral directory on immig@@ ration and social @-@ rug@@ ged material .
options in consider@@ ing , elec@@ tors , before choosing according to your ID .
not to use removable ink on the finger of a person once they have given their voice to prevent som@@ eb@@ ody twice sel@@ ects .
system@@ atic exam@@ inations on the group of a person to make sure that they are incor@@ rec@@ t .
a three @-@ year limitation to an automatic mail@@ box .
prohib@@ ition that political activ@@ ists can handle complete let@@ ting and cr@@ ushing of envelope .
the police give the power to put off @-@ off gy@@ ms .
a legisl@@ ative change to facilit@@ ate an indictment which is under the Re@@ presentation of the People Act 1983 ( Secretary of People of 1983 ) .
photographer in pol@@ ling stations .
requirement that only English in the pol@@ ling stations may be used ( with the exception of Wales ) .
inten@@ si@@ fication of the training sessions to make sure that the employee enter into the pol@@ ling cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metro@@ politan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no pen@@ al code .
&quot; the electoral law told Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his Deputy Minister for the occasion of a lit@@ urg@@ ent on corrupt and illegal pract@@ ition@@ ers . &quot; he said .
it was found guilty , due to a number of reasons - in accordance with high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; de@@ position controls &quot; of the municipal dep@@ artments of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country is wearing a proud de@@ vi@@ our as the mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents a proud and conce@@ aled withdrawal of vot@@ ers and lead of some authorities threat@@ ening this good reputation .

hon@@ oring the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces am@@ wor@@ ms time on our screens , F@@ email has created an lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ iken that have more than just a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity with Hollywood famous the@@ im .
the Jäger and Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the bike track , many people live on the internet as a certain she@@ et@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter , after pictures , on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness of the mad@@ ness in social media and gave it to be heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no great simil@@ ar@@ ity , except the fac@@ ial ha@@ iry , &quot; ordered Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a ben@@ ign guy , so I take it to be as compli@@ ments . &quot;
one of the most popular Ver@@ sions since London 2012 will und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly be at the centre : the remarkable simil@@ ar@@ ity between the British long jum@@ per is Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Ne@@ il Patrick Har@@ ris .

another persist@@ ent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who pro@@ ves heavy eyebrows and lips .

a Twitter User@@ in declared their satis@@ faction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinking about Hope Solo and Jenn@@ ifer Car@@ p@@ enter is almost identical . &quot;

Mac@@ Donald , who had been fet@@ ched into the comm@@ anding of the C@@ BS in order to bor@@ row more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connector , baby . &quot;

other Twitter User@@ in Sarah Par@@ adis wrote : &quot; Wow , # B@@ yr@@ on@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you show the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like straight raz@@ or . # raised .
some time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ olog@@ ize that the comment on a swimming pool was broadcast . &quot;
it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate form@@ ulation , it does sorry that it &apos;s happened . &quot;
at the end of more than 90 times , C@@ BC deb@@ ates to the people who have been respon@@ ding to Twitter
the poster question Scott Rus@@ sel had to be ap@@ olog@@ ized in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added to his ap@@ olog@@ ame for more than 90 other Twitter brow@@ sers that compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network acc@@ us@@ ies quickly and issued a message .
we re@@ gre@@ t it , that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they are broad@@ cast@@ ed .
we enjoyed our vie@@ wers on the show yesterday night and exc@@ use our fol@@ lowers during the social media .
in order to clear , B@@ yr@@ ons &apos; comments are related to the performance of the flo@@ at and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were un@@ reasonable and un@@ fortun@@ ate form@@ ulation . Byron does what he said , very le@@ id .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald paid in the programme and tried to just@@ ify his re@@ mark by having said that it was not his inten@@ tion that she is not designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment of time to ap@@ olog@@ ize for the comment , which I did according to the Women &apos;s S@@ BC in the C@@ BC team , he said .
&quot; I have looked at the performance of the flo@@ at , not related to them as a person . &quot;
of course , no abuse has been deli@@ ber@@ ate and it does so much for me . &quot;
buy@@ ers in Pri@@ mark feel distur@@ bed about woman , the middle of business sh@@ am@@ less under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman pulled her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mal to try under@@ p@@ ants .
in order to wor@@ ry the situation , they numbered them when she looked out in it and put them back into the shelf .
they continued to stum@@ bled and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , Italy .
the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , who tried the under@@ p@@ ants before she put back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , Jenny Davidson , who was at the same time in business said that after the mysterious woman had tried his under@@ wear , &quot; she retired and the shop left without buying . &quot;
she said , &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ lay , her own tig@@ hts and p@@ ants tried and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a little dis@@ crete location to do it - she was just there , fre@@ ch such as Oskar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she retired the p@@ ants , who did not have fallen , because she laid her back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three further entre@@ pren@@ eurs before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t forget to dance again and out .
&quot; she did not distur@@ b that she watched someone - or think about the person , who would buy the p@@ ants that she tried . &quot;
MS Davidson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; As is said to think that any one would take one person home , who had an other person and they did not have washed . &quot;
the inc@@ ident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms. Davidson added : &quot; as I have received , the staff att@@ empt@@ ed to draw out pieces from the sale after it went - what exactly is good . &quot;
&quot; I would h@@ ate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and they did not have washed . &quot;
a speaker by Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is of the inc@@ ident that announced on Tuesday 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone , deli@@ ber@@ ately . &quot;

how to protect yourself from Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it more secure for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Belt in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of whether you are coming from the front or back@@ wards you will show this video as you turn off the ske@@ wer .
if you sit down from the rear , you should see yourself as a replacement , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and refer to the Line of Fire , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder , before you hit him with your free ell@@ bow .
beat him so then with the kne@@ es in the bar and turn , while the att@@ ack@@ ers hit pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back , while they turn the weapon to him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers who approach , is the technique similar - move your body from the Line of Line , se@@ ize the weapon and turn it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
cut the weight in the weapon at the same time and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon from his grip before they move back@@ wards and raise the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it Miz@@ ra@@ chi morning .
but remember that at a pre@@ y on saf@@ est , your money is too rich - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
Reis@@ er Ian W@@ right spar@@ es his tongue for a guide to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller signed the immune system and di@@ gn@@ a@@ lex of a serious testing - taking some of the most dirty and informative places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travelling model Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Suff@@ olk will hold its course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a gel@@ ding button of a train shower as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system .
before leaving each object he used a lumin@@ aire to show himself and let us know what he is going to arrive .
but the experiment done under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner ST@@ REN@@ G@@ TH , &quot; brought some un@@ expected results of the daylight .
the thought , to ref@@ use the rinse button of a train shower , which has already been used by thousands of others , but really are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical experts on the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ ak@@ ter@@ ies as well as about his own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily nothing left , what he fitted , more than a bad taste in mouth .
Mr. W@@ right has been known to test the resistance of his gut by the world travel@@ ed and such as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to flush pull down toilets , the task assigned his immune system definitely under a sample
in the film , he said : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively und@@ ried about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ lu@@ dge . &quot;
in the film , he was able to meet his reputation in any case .
the only thing he was off , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its down@@ scale showed a lumin@@ aires of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the Lumin@@ omet@@ ric Lumin@@ aire number of freshly seas@@ oned hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to ref@@ use after their lumin@@ osity equals about 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have a score of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish producers of dairy products Val@@ io produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &quot; s Guide to In@@ ner ST@@ REN@@ G@@ TH , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ ial numbers of different locations like the bathroom
he says , &quot; This is the worst thing which I have dres@@ sed in a toilet , close to . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more dirt than this !
I am sorry for nothing because it is under ek@@ el@@ ist here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner ST@@ REN@@ G@@ TH &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Val@@ io .
the company feature Mr. W@@ right with Val@@ io Ge@@ fil@@ us , which includes both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of bo@@ wel movements and immune systems .
Val@@ ios Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to really offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating , and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy brain Storm@@ ing through which we finished that we said &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intest@@ inal health becomes a global phen@@ omen@@ on
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in intest@@ inal health is a global phen@@ omen@@ on and the documentary we were able to provide consumers for more information in an interesting manner .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who introduced me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , when he had tast@@ ed my respect for Ian , when he did some of the things that I have instru@@ cted him , such as the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet which will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there was things to do with which it was easier to bring Ian to her , and others , with which this was pretty difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of this dirty le@@ ak@@ ies . &quot;
in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 per cent of all survey@@ ed survey@@ s conducted in 2015 in particular with the pro@@ sper@@ ity of m@@ ages and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they are at least occas@@ ionally products , the added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

there are many things to consider because this property is probably regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ ified and their reputation as well .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the dw@@ elling and police that the ter@@ ror that had joined the family , tr@@ ams with bas@@ eb@@ all , in@@ spir@@ acy , drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , thre@@ at and exc@@ essive scre@@ ams , hit and cur@@ se .
sk@@ el@@ eton , 47 , whose name was standing on the le@@ ase , got an arrangement for ant@@ it@@ onal behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under circumstances , the old rub@@ b@@ ish has been found
it was included in the estate where drugs t@@ ugs were t@@ orn in the past drugs .
neighbo@@ urs told you that they were fighting on the road and asked regularly to call the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week , after they gave them a pro@@ long@@ ed period of 11 weeks to volunte@@ ered in order to draw up volun@@ tar@@ ily .
the Del@@ og@@ ging were s@@ wir@@ led by facilit@@ ated neigh@@ b@@ ors who had said that their lives have been hell .
one said , &quot; She wa@@ ited to any@@ body . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the inn@@ umer@@ able times , which we say the police here , are amazing .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - that we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family would have had to cooper@@ ate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house gar@@ bage and old toys was thrown over
added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ant has taken to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and behavior , as a del@@ og@@ ation always attrac@@ ting the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing .
that was a very difficult fall , since the behavior was extremely difficult and their de@@ eds to be aw@@ ful for their neigh@@ b@@ ors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church who have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have made us the opportunity to have done .
I hope that this development of neighbo@@ urs will give comfort and the message is not toler@@ ated that ant@@ is@@ i@@ ant behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ og@@ ging behind the ground
workers of the house management are now surrounded by gar@@ bage grape varieties that sur@@ round the house
in 2014 the police led a ri@@ azz@@ ia in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis and bri@@ dle , par@@ ap@@ around , and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ eton received a fine , after she found guilty of a drug of class B in commercial sight .
she claims that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who came in 2013 with a car accident .
after being without care , it is assumed that Tan@@ ya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation at Plymouth .
many room walls were coated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will not be ten@@ ant , holding down in the house rules .
Angela C@@ row , by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , told that the deleg@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not keep the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who can imagine that they may accept without deduc@@ tions , as well as to those who were damaged by such conduct , &quot; said they .
the Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate cri@@ min@@ ant and ant@@ is@@ ign behavi@@ ors who continue to work together with partners to protect our con@@ greg@@ ations .
tourists located in Portugal , leaving a ti@@ eff@@ ous military jet beach
Sonnen@@ an@@ bet@@ er in A@@ ve@@ iro , Portugal gave the shock of their life
a portug@@ is@@ i@@ esch@@ es P @-@ 3C Orion air@@ plane of Air Force took an incredible over@@ throw .
the Air Force felt that it was on a training flight , but har@@ ass@@ ing that no security risk was
this was the moment , in the op@@ posed to mig@@ rate to pan@@ ic , after a ti@@ eff@@ ected Jet on a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed , like the military air@@ plane near the sun beds close to the beach in A@@ ve@@ iro in the North of Portugal .
the vac@@ ations jump@@ ed when they were committed to wor@@ ry about the noise of the wor@@ ned mines , without first to see what came to them through the clouds .
the inc@@ ident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near A@@ ve@@ iro .
Daniel Fernandes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media said : &quot; it fle@@ w twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would collap@@ se . &quot;
N@@ uno Arro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that , when the plane fall down to me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of A@@ ve@@ iro were moved to pan@@ ic , when the aircraft came out of darkness and was incredibly deep fle@@ w .
the Portuguese Air Force took up today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Orion aircraft was at a training flight to identify fishing boats outside the coast , and so it had to fly so deeply that this is the only way to identify them .
the spokes@@ man told that the jet was fl@@ ushed out somewhat lower than usual , but end@@ owed the air combat traffic as usual , but end@@ owed the security at no time .
surface fi@@ res have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese Festival where four people came to death on Madeira Island .
in today , the Portuguese Air Force presented the pilot because of the conditions - strong fog and fire - so deep he had to fly .
the plane was at a training flight , with which pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise .

Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ared ″ trem@@ end@@ ous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conserv@@ ative states their majority .
in terms of pre@@ sidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weak@@ nesses of his campaign in the hi@@ ther@@ to Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large and self @-@ established mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire have expressed such a somewhat like concerns , like correspon@@ d@@ ents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the re@@ publi@@ can camp out of the race , the doubt will grow to his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have trem@@ end@@ ous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of ev@@ angel@@ ic Christians who asked for support into important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
he had the wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his known media .
re@@ publi@@ can attacks
Utah is normally a secure bank for the Republi@@ can .
a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June according to Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , and equally .
other instit@@ utes see Tr@@ ump forward but not with the distance that are common for re@@ publi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are considered as end@@ ang@@ ered .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C rep@@ lic@@ ted Tr@@ ump to the question , how to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons , &quot; exactly as I did so far . &quot;
and wonder , this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he do nothing else than &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
if it is not full for him in the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness not rich , this is ok , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports the party is advised to under@@ line money to support his election campaign .
instead of this , the candidates of the Re@@ public@@ ans will take stronger than the arms .
Olympia : g@@ ay Sc@@ am with Dop@@ ing Test
the I@@ OC wants to establish a discipl@@ inary Committee in the case .
Ken@@ yan athletes is threat@@ ened by the second Dop@@ ing @-@ Aff@@ air for the Olympic Games in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro Un@@ gem@@ ach .
after a fr@@ aud test with a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee granted to investig@@ ate a discipl@@ inary Committee in order to investig@@ ate the case .
a ken@@ ian offici@@ als shared that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village was given an ur@@ ine sample among the name of the 800 @-@ meter run@@ ner Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this was reported by the team management of Kenya by Dop@@ ing @-@ Control@@ lers .
the global association IAAF has earned the I@@ OC to find information about the case to restri@@ ct their own investig@@ ations , including a IAAF permit .
&quot; depending on the results of the test , and the following measures of the I@@ OC will make the challenge a valuation , &quot; it was called in a IAAF permit .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping control station and has given itself as a Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the re@@ hear@@ sal and signed &quot; said Ken@@ yan oss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
it was owned by the ac@@ cred@@ itation of athletes who stood on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i turned over 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan Athletics Del@@ eg@@ ation@@ f Michael Rot@@ i was picked up by the Rio Olympics .
he should be informed against monetary policy of his country about the upcoming Dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he should have been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under special observation at I@@ OC after a long time .
with the announcement of the I@@ OC out of the I@@ OC out more than 2000 d@@ oping control panels in front of the Rio games was un@@ common , that particularly athletes of Kenya and Russia are taken into the sight .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency in Brazil had much pressure to explo@@ it the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ Dop@@ ing law and a function@@ ing control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic beginning .
in the consequ@@ ence , the WA@@ DA has taken from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control con@@ forms with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as large run@@ ners @-@ nation .
the athl@@ ates of the country won by the World Cup 2015 in Beijing most medals .
in a series of television reports the ARD were repeat@@ edly raised that in Kenya &apos;s d@@ oping resources are easily accessible , and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of the Sport@@ dent .
I@@ OC member , Richard Po@@ und , called for a similar research in Kenya as he had entered into the Russian Athletics .
it could be detected that this sport @-@ area had been ne@@ op@@ tically and system@@ atically ch@@ op@@ ed .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
the Shak@@ espe@@ are @-@ Year presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a trag@@ ic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director of Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth space .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Conduc@@ tor Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he was war@@ med .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tem@@ po and their mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix that is the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really enjoyed the music in our blood !
in this production of Bart@@ oli , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rem@@ ind@@ ed of W@@ ehm@@ ut to her lover with Tony , while the younger Mary is playing and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first@@ ly because it &apos;s extremely extraordinary !
and then there would be a personality to Mary .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is wise , of course also na@@ ive , and very pas@@ sion@@ ate .
&quot; I res@@ em@@ bles me very , my Italian character that I have as a ro@@ cket , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with you .
it is a trem@@ end@@ ous generous person .
and Bart@@ oli will return the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is an exceptional artist and pas@@ sion@@ ate ! &quot;
conduc@@ ting is a need for him .
you see it in every of his movements , in his click , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a jo@@ y@@ ous approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly current : &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot;
today we decided to have refugees at that time , the pupils who had gone to New York and would not have wanted to go to New York .
they are the same topics , and they are as mean@@ ing@@ ful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London School of London , joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girl who left the year London to join the IS , died in Syria .

Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family shortly after she pre @-@ forced to leave war , and returned to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as reminder and warning to others , that these risks are linked to going to go into a war region - people are going to talk about this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , sult@@ ana and two other school girl went into a plane toward the east of London , and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas family has been commun@@ icated that she has married an I@@ SIS @-@ fighter in Syria , and has been a wid@@ ow in less months .

the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ lem@@ ere to release a 197@@ 0s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked women , they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ RAID for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar in 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine from Old@@ school @-@ PLA@@ Y@@ BO@@ YS is more infer@@ ior to &quot; Playboy for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the Calendar also .
&quot; we must return to the presentation of tim@@ eless and classical act@@ ness , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for release the calendar .
women are going to participate in this project because it is a wonderful art work .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting directors in Los Angeles and New York .

&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an inher@@ ited , sits on un@@ packs of caffeine , &quot; says the log@@ ging of the Gü@@ len Trust Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
Kur@@ dish community Germany expects to sett@@ le in the short term with tens of thousands of prot@@ ests who fle@@ w from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it might even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; believed in Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard lifting of the Turkish president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community is exp@@ ecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in short term , I estimate tens of thousands of thousands in medium term with hundreds of thousands of prot@@ ests from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime is fighting the min@@ or@@ ities and the democratic opposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had tran@@ sp@@ ered moment@@ um before the months ahead of several months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were over in Turkey on the run .
after the p@@ utsch collap@@ sed still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ elle ethnic Turks .

&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Gre@@ eks were already extinc@@ t or exp@@ elled , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U @-@ member .
the hand@@ hold also called &quot; the Federal Government have positioned &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his suppor@@ ters . &quot;
there is also a &quot; wit@@ ch j@@ ag@@ d &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an crit@@ ics in Germany .
I feel no longer in Germany during the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fe@@ ars the escape of many Turks .
more Turks will also seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ als .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics to work with voc@@ ational existence .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an lo@@ aves , sits on un@@ packs of caffeine , by the way , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot;
as the newspaper , on numbers of the Federal Ministry , the Turks had already published the largest group of asylum acknowle@@ dged persec@@ ution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people , and therefore , nearly 29 percent of all have been authorized ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , you do not find the war against war , poverty or char@@ ity .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law , i.e. from state page , individuals received .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; going to go where it we@@ ep &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the n@@ atives get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood them .
in 2021 , the farmer will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the S@@ mil@@ king parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
for that is not until now , it is not : summer holidays , heat and mountain meal - it has re@@ tained .
the loc@@ als are to be convinced by the pol@@ ling sho@@ ppers , are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are in the country are on Use@@ dom , Ru@@ egen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not loc@@ als , so do not choose the country &apos;s day .
in addition , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers that kind@@ les up posters , bal@@ lo@@ ons and fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and at the end of the vote , only effort to apply .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last stop day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go over the people just over the people .
the hot phase if one can tell at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U co@@ alition , must fear his post .
the SPD , since 1998 , has been the strongest party , now clearly behind CD@@ U .
exc@@ it@@ ingly , how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ous remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 direc@@ ting government , makes an almost un@@ remarkable campa@@ igns , one sees itself from his grand@@ posters .
he travels across the land , distributed ros@@ es and pl@@ au@@ ches a little with the people , as it did his legendary wor@@ t@@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , soul has been getting cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the bl@@ ame of the Af@@ D .
their refuge@@ e policy , &quot; We do this &quot; have acceler@@ ated the asc@@ en@@ sion of sp@@ op@@ u@@ des , which will probably cost him the beautiful office .
the CD@@ U with its nick@@ name dates , the Minister of the Minister Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , when you make the wrong time at the right place battle .
she has been invited to German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Merkel is on the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; def@@ endant Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR .
but there was no one to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany , Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U is largely driven on market places and shopping areas with umbrel@@ las and air balloon .
that , so will Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
also the Union has noticed that in the land weak@@ ened the base that they need to feel very close to inv@@ ent one wire for people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , hardly exists in the territory of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U electoral campaign , however , is also self @-@ grab@@ bing : &quot; you have to go there , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game has , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to an especially committed campaign .
in pol@@ ls the S &amp; Ds last with 22 percent behind CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at election 2011 , the SPD had still won 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , tiny party with seven percent in pol@@ ls could be the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern vir@@ tue from the holiday in need and selling their campa@@ igns largely in the Internet .
&quot; online electoral campaign , &quot; it &apos;s the president of Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green dial conver@@ ters on track search for local stim@@ ul@@ ants under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Silke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ ated with a ho@@ use@@ able house by the m@@ eckl@@ ist lakes and it is also beautiful .
your impression : &quot; candidates in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no pun@@ ishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ rehab@@ il@@ itation : restaurants suffer from bar@@ rier
at the speed@@ iness the B 27 is re@@ paired , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .

&quot; those have done everything quite ti@@ dy , &quot; says El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff music from the Jet gas station .

construction site was scheduled to be moved some@@ time at the beginning of October , until the end of October , everything will be ready .
this will also be the ent@@ ities of responsibility for the construction works , about when it comes to set aside .
since the site was carried out on Monday to the south , and also the blo@@ cking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been abol@@ ished and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has also been relaxed , has relaxed the traffic situation within the place .
citizens now can go on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the ev@@ itable traffic through the place seems to come back .
&quot; there was partially substanti@@ al complaints , &quot; says the chief chief of the former director Florian King .
the local residents of brook , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many Schle@@ ich@@ ways tried and rather tru@@ sted in their Nav@@ i as the signs .
what led to that some truck was fran@@ k in residential areas .
since even the speed lim@@ iting is not maintained , the community activ@@ ates the measuring vehicle from mal@@ ign@@ ore .
&quot; there was considerable survi@@ ving , &quot; says King that himself pointed out on the location about the situation .
there are already two to three per minute have been et@@ ched .
the fastest was on the way to reach the speed of 77 km in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the building has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people in the B 27 , it is only a small Tro@@ st that is now open for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
in the cards , business people don &apos;t have to look like .
however , that the B 27 restoration among them has led to sales bro@@ od , each one who asks you are looking through .
however some more and some are affected .
who has less to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; so for other firms , for which the renovation has hardly any consequences .
also at the Auto@@ haus Maier , Thomas Sul@@ z says of a &quot; most slight decline , &quot; but also there is a fact that of course &quot; Dis@@ claim@@ er is missing . &quot;
the most heavily pre@@ val@@ ed road places along the road .
J. Albert G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly known as crown .
this is already existing threat@@ ening .
not only for him , but all the restaurants were &quot; hard hit . &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and R@@ ott@@ weil .
we have to be glad about each Euro turnover .
it has risen to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the road junction has been put back by two years . &quot;
he must have dis@@ missed the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dis@@ missed , the policy would have changed different .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on request of G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , if there would be a financial compensation which would benefit from the share of the location at the B 27 . now they also have the draw@@ backs which arise through the rehab@@ il@@ itation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other land@@ circles , where a little gener@@ ously handled .
for all suits , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER is sure that its participation will continue .
finally , the family business has been based here since 17@@ 15 , refers to the long history .
that other regular guests are now less often pre@@ vent@@ ing due to the complex transport leadership .
you can &apos;t drive around , it is also pretty beautiful .
after the end of the reconstruction works again , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER has no doubt about that .
despite the cr@@ ises with BSE and avi@@ an fl@@ u G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER keeps the effects of the B 27 @-@ construction works on his customer for the biggest crisis that has experienced its own history in its long@@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
the terror@@ ist fighting is constantly screwed on the name of the terror@@ ist fighting .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Interior de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère now lays a new safety package .
but what does a Dul@@ d@@ ungs@@ status have to do with ter@@ ror ?
and what does the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ers say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère gives the reconc@@ ili@@ ation .
all his proposals were &quot; polit@@ ically generally &quot; polit@@ ically , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Security at the performance of his new security packages .
they are superior to any@@ body .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in it too .
but as the Minister of Interior , he is located on the results and a con@@ sens@@ us con@@ sens@@ us within the co@@ alition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg , Ans@@ bach did not leave a little time before he presented his conclusion for security in the Republic .
but the fall now fall around .
one has already announced , announced that a new security authority must take care of the cr@@ acking of encrypted communications , is not new .
also not the fact that Germany has to transl@@ ate multiple EU specifications to air@@ plane and weapons .
the call for more video monitoring and staff for safety authorities as well as no surprise .
in part , de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère takes a second attempt on suggest@@ ions to do with the SPD so far : he wants to make symp@@ athy for terror@@ ist groups and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citi@@ zen@@ ship to the German Pass .
&quot; the more difficult points will be for the SPD , &quot; dream of the CD@@ U man .
he still keep doing this for mostly and necess@@ ity , which has no od@@ ds at the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ers .
a few new ideas presented by de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère .
partly it is partly in : it plans quick procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ en@@ tion of people before de@@ port@@ ation .
refugees who are target@@ ed to the country will allow their smart phones to check their smart phones and reve@@ al social media accounts for a security check .
he wants to kill some asylum seek@@ ers for ab@@ ov@@ ated asylum seek@@ ers as to date - approximately such that off@@ ences carry out or re@@ con@@ sci@@ ously take away their identity in order to den@@ y their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and leg@@ ally he@@ ic@@ el .
def@@ icient is still un@@ balanced and easy to ask questions .
and with some points - at in@@ equality of ideas , for example - is the question : what does this have to do with security and ter@@ ror ?
Yes , Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère says it &apos;s important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and ter@@ ror .
but it is not possible to address the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ter of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
in addition , many people did wor@@ ry about safety in view of the high refuge@@ e camps .
and things that had pro@@ found@@ ly employed people , did not break out even in campa@@ igns .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ saf@@ egu@@ arding is great .
and yes , there are election strug@@ gles .
Union and SPD focus on inner security therefore increasingly in position .
in the past days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ret dis@@ pute over the appoint@@ ments of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some im@@ ions of the Minister , also demand a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return from dou@@ bling citi@@ zen@@ ship .
de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère takes care here to su@@ al tones .
from a return from the double pass , he is nothing .
we have satis@@ f@@ ying the discussion in Germany .
they re@@ ap@@ se , be not mean@@ ing@@ ful .
and in a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohib@@ ition , he is const@@ itutional objec@@ tions .
whether his own package is const@@ itutional at all corners as it is actually &quot; generally , &quot; for the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ers , it must still be shown .
there is a lot in what could do for dis@@ pute .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ filed an internal security .
Part@@ e@@ ich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel signed first time to talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contri@@ bute to the security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming due to Volkswagen .
in spite of diesel variants the delivery numbers worldwide grow .
but not in all markets , there are round .
in the call@@ ous campaign , there are hosts for a term .
Volkswagen will compete in the deliveries held in the second half .
Europe &apos;s biggest car bu@@ ilder can also be present in the previous year despite the diesel engine thanks to its many brand and some well @-@ running markets further .
however , in July , the core brand VW compet@@ ed mainly in Western Europe and charged the overall sales , as mentioned in the D@@ ax .
in July , the Volkswagen brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China &apos;s second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany the deliveries are cut off by almost a hexagon .
brand conf@@ used Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the we@@ aker numbers from July especially on two sales days in Europe .
in addition , in some nuclear markets , I have given the &quot; variable economic conditions &quot; to accept sales .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um caused the withdrawal from the EU leaving a spokes@@ person .
in the U.S. , where the exhaust aff@@ air was first es@@ cal@@ ated , there is also a minus of beech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the hous@@ ek@@ e@@ eping brand of Lower Saxony is further developed by the Diesel and@@ al : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
the group reported by Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to mark a sales spl@@ its from January to July .
in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered in this period from € 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated using a software dispatch tests .
in Germany alone , VW features some 2.5 million cars to repair shops .
in the course of modified VW that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
following the conversion of vehicles I give fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor output in no deter@@ i@@ oration .
the auto@@ bauer sk@@ ates the customer after the conversion , a &quot; guaranteed purchase &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; warranty , &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel .
the reason is legal ent@@ ities .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen supplied its German customers now a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models .
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ Re@@ present@@ atives at the Federal Ministry of Transport .
it was confirmed that this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; VW has completed the editions of my In@@ qu@@ iry and the KBA to ful@@ fill . &quot;
&quot; de@@ vi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; Federal Minister for Transport , Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after the conversion don &apos;t have any wor@@ sen@@ ing and any type of interest rates remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; warranty &quot; but not how it was called in corporate culture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damage we have nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ and@@ al to ensure a guarantee on any warranty regul@@ ators as it was called .
therefore , I don &apos;t use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Raiffeis@@ enbank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal investig@@ ations - as second Institute in Germany .
Bank Office Josef Paul said to Thursday : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who par@@ ked about 40 million euros to Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ . &quot;
German banks Association speaks of a single case and does not see a signal : normal as@@ par@@ able &quot; do not fear , to pay for their au@@ ster@@ ity pen@@ se . &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , their accounts need to pay 0.4 per cent .
the fee does the Raiffeis@@ enbank G@@ mund withdraw from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100.000 Euros to Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro a year , &quot; Paul said .
he has been holding some 40 million euros over a day that could be picked up from one day to another , and that he could not be conce@@ aled .
&quot; lying with me at the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; said the bank of the bank .
&quot; I can &apos;t lie down for any million 4000 euros . &quot;
the costs will now continue to give the pre@@ aching principle .
the cash is easy to be bank in the bank rides , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I already had four trans@@ gres@@ ses , I would not like the fifth ! &quot; said the bank . &quot;
most customers could have comprehen@@ sion and change another system changes .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the state association of Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of EC@@ B caused considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
it alone can be applied , &quot; is not possible for business econom@@ ically . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for credit cards , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal off@@ enses for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Raiffeis@@ enbank Al@@ ten@@ burg land@@ ed with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 head@@ lines .
Michael Kem@@ mer , the principal leader of the banking group , said : &quot; we do not expect that private clients have to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks have much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker told , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see I give &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele that is equipped with a somewhat l@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; that can become a small bank account for a small bank , if they are free money .
founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund has established branch office in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region known actors , athletes and entre@@ pren@@ eurs live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooper@@ ative association of Bavaria &quot; are currently known to calculate an out@@ fit set for inser@@ ts of private customers , &quot; says spokes@@ man Ernst .
the President of the German public banks and Raiffeisen banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had been declared by the end of June : &quot; the threshold into neg@@ atives to go to the private client , is very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of An@@ leg@@ ern to the competition .
customers in Germany will not leave this in the width .
dest@@ ination records : who does actually buy sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men love middle age dear plates .
before you come to the comment section , in order to so@@ w him under the p@@ se@@ ud@@ onym of non @-@ bal@@ sam@@ ic men with rough Bel@@ ins@@ ults , this statement runs from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the promising re@@ union of sound plates do not want to gre@@ et a boom in mill@@ enn@@ ials , which would like to welcome the re@@ generation of physical objects , but on mid@@ life nost@@ alg@@ ia .
those who purchased a record have recently bought a record , according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most un@@ likely collective group .
there is also no hor@@ des through ho@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ als - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ key problems re@@ tain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending her own time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but will the results be You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would cut the camera , while I am am@@ id@@ st a busy road in S@@ oho e , a hum@@ ble grey suit so I keep my hands keep my hands and something an immen@@ se look like : &quot; so , let us take a closer look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look on it .
even if the heart is charming slowly at his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sal@@ es@@ man were resident , there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic flat business stores .
I would like to ask the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to observe the age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , I found out of S@@ ister Ray ( Data : two young women , three men mean age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Data : eight men &apos;s middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops in order to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , ask me ?
&quot; I appreciate it , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
this record , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by him ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he poss@@ esses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not buy and sell objects when it was sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I bought will come from the late 60s , early 70s , appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; says he says .
he agre@@ es that those who buy plates , are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted , and add to your own time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
that is my L@@ ace .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray believes that many customers believe he meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who will have influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have to be seen again their old plates .
of the talks I kept , people usually have taken care of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who have once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom in tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleg@@ ed emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to recognize that cover stores a so@@ othing community of equ@@ il@@ ibri@@ um .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers came to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel over@@ whel@@ med up from the digital world and would like to re@@ treat stability of conf@@ used noise cover , back@@ grounds , which stim@@ ulate tac@@ tic .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or pos@@ session of material property as one type of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
it is with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; we fle@@ w a staff of a flat@@ stack .
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of those who purchased a record last month , they have not heard yet .
the pol@@ l also found that 41 % have a record player who will never use it while 7 % of those who have a record , not have a record player .
at this point of message , I would probably look very concerned while I bl@@ ame through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova compli@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , used in sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( data number : three men intermediate age ) has worked , has a &quot; tro@@ ph@@ er aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ al .
&quot; som@@ eb@@ ody first came here soon and said , &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a Radio@@ head record so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
more productive heavy , less mus@@ ic@@ ed .
we have people who say , &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who are only slowly becoming cleaned .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an enter@@ taining audience when I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ agers and women &apos;s middle age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts of latest syn@@ thesis - and sex@@ ually @-@ packed pop instead of experimental Jazz goes from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such a diversity in the customer .
none of them can look strange , but brand new psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to fix when you stand next to som@@ eb@@ ody for 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and consider the variety of products for sale .
it is more of a man@@ ne@@ quin than a large purchase .
they deser@@ ves much , therefore it is not an actual option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a lovely ro@@ uf@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop , of which is said to have inspired a new generation of panel fans . urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the note that I observe the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teenage cameras , which for a moment to group@@ ing out polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter per@@ su@@ ade to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left you find a stair@@ case , a wall full of panels of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ e@@ house and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees her to - perhaps because they are only pu@@ rely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to capture it .
it is pure &quot; modern art . &quot;
but in view of it that every attrac@@ tion invol@@ ve more money for the industry and send some customers to the dep@@ ths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , also that is the most suitable for luxury objects such as sheets .
even if my research results showed that the results can be judged by You@@ Go@@ v , they are at least in record shops in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors and plates that exist in reality , record shops and in online .
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not to do with b@@ umm@@ eln through the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they star@@ ing a guard of an un@@ heim@@ en , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator me@@ iden who ch@@ ill from the shoulders lack@@ ing men &apos;s middle age .

French court rejected the demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refuge@@ e camp
a French court has rejected by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of t@@ ent@@ or@@ ic shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
the authorities set out this week in Cal@@ ais , that the state should sett@@ le in Cal@@ ais that the state should be able to sell 72 mak@@ esh@@ ips to energy drinks within the camp of goods , selling chocolate services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euro in provis@@ ional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ f@@ ecture consist@@ ed that these places should be sh@@ orn down , because they would be a parallel economy , which would not be paid for a parallel economy and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanit@@ arian groups participated in the court that the business and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by the state supported association and other groups , which would not offer sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
they get beyond that the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants are often shelter and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the instruction of people who operate the 72 provis@@ ional shops , but cle@@ ared out that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; should be perfectly rep@@ utable . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la told that food business , caf@@ es and restaurants would play a lot more big role than just people who live in extreme pre@@ stige conditions . &quot;
he said that the area offers quiet hits between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threat@@ ened by the ra@@ iny was the Jungle Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , which was non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice to asylum seek@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the pet@@ ition to keep the Kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure for the children of a cat@@ astrophe would be , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er need to adjust to the next generation of speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested to be effectively over@@ acted .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic end@@ uring trailer of the Vit@@ ronic software from Wiesbaden can be used for example , where it would be haz@@ ardous to a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on motorway construction or to rolling bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure a stationary Bl@@ ender to ensure compliance with the speed limit .
but a lasting mobile body can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interru@@ pted measuring mode , the case data are transmitted via a modem .
with Laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be det@@ ri@@ ded over multiple tracks .
variable speed limit as well as transit passengers after time , drivers and vehicle classes are also monitored .
in the highly dependent condition you can move the pendant according to manufacturer with a trailer hit@@ ch .
that it is not easy to use it , it is lower@@ ed in the measuring mode , so that the wheels were dis@@ pat@@ ched in the pan@@ es and also f@@ ash@@ ing f@@ ender outside .
the built @-@ in alarm system should also protect the blast@@ ers from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also employed .
foreign agencies also flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently , France has posted 100 pieces , after an order made of 150 pieces last year .
Britain reco@@ vers silver in the 7 @-@ star Rug@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold .
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ s Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday night to hold a hold in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro stages here in Rio .
Fiji had a master@@ class in handling , Side @-@ Ste@@ pping , post @-@ back , line and ro@@ her force to win gold - their first Olympic medals of all colours .
the defeat was won by the non @-@ exist@@ ent Prize of silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the substanti@@ al defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the sem@@ if@@ in@@ als of the same day could fall back in the fin@@ als .
but in this form , Fiji had defeated a 15 @-@ man team in his shape .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Che@@ b trainer Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult journey behind him .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan each game at Adelaide Se@@ v@@ ens .
they lost only one here .
this fl@@ ap will we@@ ep , but progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks of GB@@ s from fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in the buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went up in the corner as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au .
Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack on the right corner with another four minutes running time .
12 @-@ 0 and GB installed almost the ball .
a high @-@ outstanding T@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stopped the Berg by Mann vs. Nak@@ ar@@ awa , but Fiji had only stopped .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua reached a touch@@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ ship and there was still about a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ f@@ ished by further weak T@@ ack@@ lings of the GB teams and storm@@ y to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so when Fiji had been born to play the 7 playing , while the GB still is still aw@@ ning .
that &apos;s how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half time by and joined the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the rati@@ os of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a br@@ illi@@ ant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running long in favour of the Sou@@ theast sulph@@ ites , whose fans sank , flags b@@ ends and dance on the trib@@ une .
it was not difficult to adm@@ ire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame replaced the i @-@ Tü@@ pfel@@ chen with another attempt in the last seconds .
the wh@@ ist@@ le em@@ itted , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ ac@@ ed himself and kno@@ cked his GB crum@@ bly in the la@@ wn .
previously , Fiji had defeated Japan in sem@@ if@@ in@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain placed South Africa in a squ@@ ad half final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and sco@@ red a gate in the second half .
an brilliant T@@ ack@@ ling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured profits - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the trainer of the coach for rowing victory
there will be no emotional gold than with these games and what would be called .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard he@@ ie@@ ve that was in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all in the second Olympic champion in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , which put on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , at all the 39.@@ 95 in@@ sole use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we are looking are two br@@ illi@@ es Ath@@ let@@ es , gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of go@@ ers , which is not reflected in the kind of tri@@ umph@@ s .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ al@@ ion on willing hel@@ pers to contri@@ bute to the incre@@ mental progress , which would not know the difference before the trainer , who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and that did .
if you do not do this , he is spre@@ ading everywhere .
it would have been a quite worse situation .
it changes a little further views .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was fortun@@ ate that he could be the treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , what the break was at a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the right concept .
I needed money , so it had to go better again .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would answer .
this is how it begins .
the rowing is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the in@@ vis@@ ibility of victory there were their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a ner@@ vous dri@@ er in this morning and tried to process his own fe@@ ars .
St@@ anning , which was in use as a captain in the Royal Art@@ illery reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional dis@@ rack . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated only how much I means , how much I and Helen and others did work .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no man , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could have no better person for train@@ ers or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning do not have a race in the last five years .
the couple had a tough rhythm , with whom their oppon@@ ents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to connect , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; ble@@ ib in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to let not take away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make some Tol@@ les .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we wanted to get out a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , their own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ bone .
now she simply wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that could have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so distur@@ bed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels much better on , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ously care for clarity .
the managing director of the &quot; Ve@@ it@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; , R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide . &quot;
a small fresh water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
it was that of some time ago in the original post of the Bavarian Radio in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
little later the Water@@ forum was the government of the fran@@ ken affili@@ ate .
the work of the Ve@@ it@@ uted group learned &quot; Bavarian far as ex@@ empl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zwe@@ ck@@ verband collabor@@ ator , 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired from the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose of the Ve@@ it@@ enst@@ one group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes ca . 15@@ 0000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 residents .
member states are the churches of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and Ba@@ un@@ ach City .
for further cities and municip@@ alities , there are water supply contracts .
the current chair , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor Gertrud Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rem@@ ind@@ ed that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was stopped in 1985 as a water de@@ eper and was appointed to be the managing director in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extend from the water pipeline construction and maintenance activities , the budget planning , lim@@ itation of charges and contributions to emergency sets , &quot; said the chairman .
when outstanding events they called the commission@@ ing and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , commissioned by the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the new fountain ( 1999 ) , the re@@ creation of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ generation of water pipes .
there have been no n@@ urs@@ ing and I have always included new features , because water lives and pot@@ able water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio , she ble@@ ed the v@@ ault of loy@@ al , reliable and proper service over 31 years .
he used himself with a lot of heart blood for its water purpose and he has been regularly living the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
prior to a few weeks ago he has to present the success concept of the Ve@@ it@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; in front of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Business Forum in front of a few weeks ago .
for that he received very acknowle@@ d@@ gement and praise .
the Ru@@ pert G@@ öller into one hand pra@@ ised Wasser@@ wart Alf@@ ons Grie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best Wasser@@ wart and he was a loy@@ al squ@@ id .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his perspective , he called the fountain pen and re@@ structuring of the devil .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult applications were the pipe b@@ ump in Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night to avoid the villages with water .
once the supply of Neu@@ brunn was once only used to maintain the p@@ ett@@ ish bin from p@@ ett@@ stadt with dust .
the management of the pot@@ able water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer made of Lau@@ ter , who represents the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and applies to other affected parents : &quot; she must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a spoke in the 44 @-@ year @-@ old .
when the disease was recognized by her son , they believed they die .
now the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago had come well forward and learn private in New York , where there is the best therap@@ eu@@ vre .
&quot; to give an example : if I sang a little wonder what two years ago , when I sang in La Scala &apos;s Mail@@ änder , he remin@@ ds of nothing . &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko .
but he is the most happy man on earth .

relationship of relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ e@@ ide - Man fits on his partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at his partner at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ e@@ ide ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 , and in@@ ju@@ red them .
&quot; the man asked ourselves to call us and given his life to life , &quot; said a police officer .
the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors &apos; on the run , after him will be publicly displayed .
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.80 m tall , mus@@ cular , brown and has a gl@@ at@@ se .
meanwhile the police has released a photo of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man we@@ ars a Gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could then bear the weapon with himself , so the police force .
w@@ ho@@ ever sees Sven S. , the 110 will call .
the police speaks of &quot; relationship of relationship . &quot;
the vic@@ tim was born in 1988 , the per@@ pet@@ r@@ ator , 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck initially wanted to make no information about the ather@@ fall or relations between per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors and victims , but they confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing del@@ ic@@ t . &quot;
&quot; more we are not saying , &quot; said a police station in Lübeck .

steel - light view for Deutsche St@@ ah@@ lin@@ dustrie
the risk @-@ controlled and en@@ ergetic German steel industry remains un@@ spar@@ ed in millions of millions of additional costs .
financial burden which threat@@ ened the industry from the oil industry , are from the table .
ab@@ ide with the liberation from the renewable energy production situation in the German steel industry , Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ german General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really glad that after two years of f@@ enced negotiations we could have finally achieved . &quot;
the European Commission planned originally planned to operate the steel producer for generating the gases coming from the high @-@ furnace for power consumption , to check out the c@@ ash@@ ier .
according to German Bran@@ chen@@ stock industry , the steel industry threat@@ ened its additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z : it is now to give a foundation agreement with the EU Commission for talks with cont@@ empl@@ ation in Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the gener@@ ators are replaced in the steel works , all an EEG lev@@ y is of 20 percent .
but this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission for self @-@ production engineers .
thus the status qu@@ o of the hi@@ ther@@ to regulation will largely be established .
the successful significance of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; even during the reform of emission trade , IG Metall and Emp@@ loyment aims , &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering under over@@ capacity and a considerable prize .
last year , the situation continues to rise as the world &apos;s biggest generation in China in view of weak@@ ened steel on the global market .
European producers throw chin@@ ese steel concerts .
in the course of this spring the situation has relaxed .
to the one show filed n@@ au@@ ts on Import@@ ant effect , the others have inhib@@ ited economic pro@@ spects in China .
un@@ clear is how sustainable the price reduction is .
the German industry pri@@ m Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp was c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
finally the prices have st@@ agn@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts on difficult situation with further costs .
at the end of Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclu@@ de any of the works of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 0,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July the German steel producer remain c@@ auti@@ ous in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons of raw steel as compared to the previous year , as the economic agreement was approved on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity then went back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below last year .
in the coming months , the association anticip@@ ates improved in@@ coming orders with increasing in@@ hal@@ ation .
community , spirit , health : sing Sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp has esc@@ orted her entire life : as a young girl she took part in the school &apos;s choir , the student of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sing together in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; I will sing - emotional and physi@@ cally , &quot; she describes it .
after a re@@ hear@@ sal , she feels happy , che@@ er@@ ful and a whole life , says she .
very next to it , they do good for their health and spirit .
for singing is equal from several per@@ spectives , a great ho@@ bby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard Hack@@ ler from the German Sen@@ iors division .
most sen@@ iors sing together in the choir and share the joy of the music , describes Hack@@ ers .
by regular cooperation , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts .
because often , social and family structures will solve in the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says Hack@@ ler .
since the sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who ur@@ ged his l@@ ungs regularly , does not work as fast as the pu@@ rest in daily life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal ho@@ bby .
in el@@ derly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Market of the Sen@@ iors organisations .
in the el@@ derly generations common singing had a lot of job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening songs in older people are many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time .
by song lyrics and especially mel@@ o@@ dies , people are un@@ affected by even de@@ men@@ tia people .
in singing , a particular achievement is called , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , foc@@ using on their own voice and on a given rhythm which is to match the other singers - this is a big cogn@@ itive challenge .
even older people who live alone , practice not just foc@@ using on yourself .
another positive aspect is the recognition we proce@@ eded by singing in the chor@@ us , says Hack@@ ler .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ feeling of self est@@ e@@ em is growing by singing in a choir .
to show yourself : if I say long for something I will improve and watch over me - this experience stronger .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new ho@@ bby , should not hes@@ itate - even if he says , little tal@@ ent to have L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who ce@@ ases , when a sound goes beside it ?
in search of the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different ways , says Hack@@ ler .
sing som@@ eb@@ ody from the awareness of a senior intelli@@ gence , you simply can join them .
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir can be addressed directly to the church or the church leaders .
many Sen@@ iors you can find also about the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet , can ask your family , friends or neighbo@@ urs around the Internet .
w@@ ho@@ ever wants to sing , should be connected to a chor@@ us .
sing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for every age .
cats respon@@ d sen@@ sible as cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of young animals
biolog@@ ists studied in Hanover , what is the impact of cat @-@ bu@@ ys on adult animals .
because of their surprise the r@@ ens had no cold , however , they kept in the difference to the females always equal .
Female cats may recognize the el@@ derly coverage of cat @-@ bu@@ ys at the che@@ wing of the little ones .
they respon@@ d around ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of Kitt@@ ens , who were in great dist@@ ress , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) found out .
hang@@ over also react to the calls of Kitt@@ ens - however still the same .
&quot; apparently the audi@@ ble differences between the r@@ w of less and strongly encour@@ aged young are either not per@@ cep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said by the MH@@ H .
it is the first of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C E@@ vol@@ u@@ tionary Biology &quot; at this Friday .
in a previous examination , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ al scre@@ ams is different with the urg@@ ency of their help .
altogether nine adult tom@@ cats and eight female puppies were observed from the MH@@ 17 zo@@ di@@ gn@@ osis .
they were played for a calls of little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
at the other they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger K@@ itt@@ ens , which were also up@@ lifted .
the researchers maintain their results despite the small sample for mean@@ ing@@ ful .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not had his own offspring , re@@ acted on the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned fast to the speaker if this Ru@@ fe was played for a very bear@@ able k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be up@@ born or develop with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; one surprise was that the male respon@@ ds at all , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already research@@ ed the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women responded to inf@@ ants , whether they were already moth@@ ers or not , reported the biolog@@ ist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , a arrest warrant had been en@@ forced against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is being accused of being a member of a terror@@ ist group .
an important football game takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt .
in front of the Du@@ el the Arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line shows the official line : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
the government , in July , after the revolution taking place in July , the government refused to be im@@ paired by the norm .
this does not apply to those who susp@@ ected to be susp@@ ected of using the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
but even before the football , it is not necessary .
the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant against the former Sw@@ im Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
this is now being thrown into the South America in America , a member of a terror@@ ist group .
the author of the Pre@@ dig@@ an Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len will be responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although it is valid for 90 days , the exceptional condition is still valid until October , in fact , this has become the life of most Turks , however not as good as no effect .
the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; in public places throughout the country has completed Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - like the whole country - split up in tra@@ ilers and oppon@@ ents Erd@@ og@@ ans .
especially fans of the workers of workers have tradition@@ ally not count to the friends of the President .
but in the sight of the Turks , but in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict re@@ jection of military coup is drawn .
there &apos;s even the fans - no matter whether you propos@@ es a heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
for Pok@@ al@@ ert &quot; Gala &quot; it will arrive to Lucas Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
in the past season , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first season as a top@@ sc@@ or@@ er of his association with 17 gates , and nine templates in all competitions .
in the end of the game for Fen@@ er@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he sco@@ red the 1 : 0 charts .
the newspaper &quot; FAN@@ A@@ TIK &quot; celebrated it : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he finished the season in a brilliant way and secured the tro@@ phy in his crew .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for record was a conc@@ ili@@ atory gradu@@ ation .
following the pre @-@ round K.@@ co in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; has also distingu@@ ished early in the Europa League .
in the south , it was just enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win a bit .
&quot; we made it and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seas@@ onal fore@@ ff@@ ers were the based on the 14th title as southern run@@ ners .
that is also the reason that fans continue to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the end of the AC Florence in the AC of Florence , B@@ ik@@ tas had announced only rent Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to return to the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; if Mario would like to come to us , he must say it only , &quot; said the magazine &quot; Kick@@ er &quot; Club@@ tor F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
but the falls of the falls must be ready , however , to do some one @-@ third of its estimated € 7.5 million , Or@@ man stated : &quot; its content in Fir@@ enze we cannot pay . &quot;

there was a wh@@ im@@ si@@ cal scene : with a big smile , she was proud to be proud in the hall and had pro@@ vo@@ iced with her gig .
as a fest@@ ive that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a ju@@ bel@@ vedere .
but there are many more athletes who go on the start in spite of the Olympic Games at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most contro@@ ver@@ si@@ ent figures in the athle@@ tics row .
he was locked in two times because of Dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his B@@ ann the Olympic champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he has been the number one of the world in 9,80 seconds and is considered the biggest one of Us@@ ain Bolt .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m Rel@@ ay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ hour Olympic champion had to sit in a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the intake of the pain using Oxy@@ co@@ don .

La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ stage world champion had been closed and closed 21 months in 2010 .

this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ets were detected so many medals .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , having been diagnosed with test@@ oster@@ one d@@ oping .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave the silver award because of ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the European Championship title in 2006 because of test@@ oster@@ one abuse .
he also acknowle@@ dged the bronze medal at the Olympic Games in 2008 as a result of the International Criminal Court , CAS .

Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austri@@ as in@@ ju@@ red - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday early .
she had suffered cutting and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again .
she planned your home trip to the beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ ill , also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as the öll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a quarter of two bom@@ bs .
according to the police , a Thai change were killed and about 20 people were in@@ ju@@ red , including Austrian enrich@@ ment , three Germans , three Dutch and three Ital@@ ians .
Friday morning were two jumps back , and another man was killed , according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket is also reported to a bom@@ b explosion in the morning .
the Det@@ onation in the near of the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red by a cab driver by police .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , the south @-@ east coast of the country explo@@ ded another bom@@ b which killed an urban development .
according to the authorities in a flower stal@@ k in front of the four of the coastal police in the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations dem@@ anded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ omp@@ on at the south east coast .
one go in connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in whose name was called .
&quot; the bom@@ bing classes carry the same manusc@@ ript , &quot; said Ar@@ me@@ egen@@ er@@ al Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Freit@@ as early before journalists .
&quot; we anticip@@ ate that it is a coordin@@ ated attack . &quot;
it was too early to express itself with possible mot@@ ives - probably it is about the de@@ eds of Muslim Reb@@ els .
Thai media also wanted to recognize the patterns that is typical for the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ atist@@ ics in the south of the country .
the Thai Police , however , explained the attacks in relation to the Islam@@ ist movement or the international terror@@ ism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
one more clearly , that the bom@@ bs of the Opp@@ on@@ ents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities would have been informed under the country &apos;s secret notes on the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the precise time and places of the country .
neither be un@@ clear what group falls behind the attacks .
the police pointed out their civil war throughout the country , security , as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and mer@@ cif@@ ix .
in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings but they usually do not judge for tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ ib@@ ol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the fruitful bom@@ b explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is advis@@ able to result in the Direc@@ tions of the Thai Security Council .
high level of security ( security level 3 ) taught for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Song@@ h@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ be and its surroundings .
in terms of security , the Muslim population of the population is not necessary to travel in these provinces .
increased risk of security ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a Constitution for a few days after a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al referendum on a Constitution .
this asser@@ t to the military great influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CHA said that the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to hit chaos while the country is toward stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had se@@ ized power in 2014 after a phase of blo@@ ody measures , has with@@ drawn himself to have the kingdom return to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get the grip of Muslim reb@@ els in the extreme south of the country for years .
in the conflict more than 6500 people were killed .
a year ago , almost one year ago in Bangkok had been killed in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine in 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ ody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in@@ sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
after several days also , the Constitutional Gu@@ ards have also asked the const@@ itu@@ ent in the group .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ it@@ arian movement &quot; An@@ other points for asp@@ ir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic basic rules , &quot; said Const@@ itu@@ ent Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate by the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus , mig@@ rants are diff@@ am@@ inated from the Middle East in an extrem@@ ist way .
thus we watch the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group of group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
she turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ultur@@ alism &quot; , &quot; Im@@ proved Mass Im@@ migration &quot; and &quot; loss of your own identity by an over@@ ride . &quot;
const@@ itu@@ tion@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Bavaria , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said he did his authority in the decision closely with the offices .
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &quot; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
generally , extreme cases , they often have to speak with young language , often involving p@@ opp@@ ing music .
the open@@ ly Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ driving trem@@ ors .
this is not a useful advertising for your own business .
the pro@@ paganda should respon@@ d emotional response .
young people are in a special way .
this is dangerous .
in the end of several federal states , there have been contacts of &quot; ident@@ it@@ arian &quot; of Af@@ D polit@@ icians .
Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge .
for the const@@ itu@@ ent use , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist , changes and extrem@@ ist .
so , if such people are control of the party control on the party .
this is not recogn@@ iz@@ able .
with a view of the marked increase of legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees said , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terror@@ ism in this context .
but we have established in recent years that there can be legal structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that other law@@ ful groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refuge@@ e she@@ es or attacks from other legal experts .
a wide @-@ wide or European control of law@@ ster@@ r@@ ism is however not recogn@@ iz@@ able .
the previous groups were made at regional level or social networks .
Ma@@ ate convinced that many over the people went over to the account of people who had not entered into the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying ar@@ ming .
many of the susp@@ ects at asylum seek@@ ers were not previously known as cri@@ min@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or tra@@ ilers of the right scene .
&quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences who had previously voted against nothing at the hat , who were perhaps polit@@ ically in@@ different or for example CD@@ U , SPD or lin@@ ke , however , radi@@ cally have radi@@ cally driven by far right mist@@ ak@@ ic stim@@ ulation . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is promoted to Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olymp@@ ion@@ iken or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this displays the bra@@ ve gig of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight sw@@ immers from Ethiopia is so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV images .
he disappeared simply - no matter how far the cutting was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a back@@ ward of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was more of his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is still part of the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special starting law from the international floating association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ presented countries .
because in Ethiopia most athletes run , did Hab@@ te wanted to make something different .
preparing is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the lap quickly .
some media reported it as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the Whal@@ e . &quot;
his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; pointed out to the &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Freestyle , there played no role .
compar@@ is@@ ons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric Mo@@ uss@@ amb@@ ani take care of media attention .
an unforgettable appearance was the entrance of the rooms of Equ@@ ator@@ ial Guinea , when he had to run on a lead over 100 metres of Freestyle .
fr@@ en@@ gene@@ tically was fired Mo@@ uss@@ amb@@ ani at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old had to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never held a distance from the competition before the competition .

over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - and dis@@ cover@@ ies from the previous calendar period are subject to balance .
in fact , Schmidt founded the grave sho@@ ck@@ les in fact that there are relatively small facilities around relatively small facilities with a very low water@@ an@@ arr@@ he@@ a that is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .

Schmidt : &quot; at this extraordinary expenditure , the advanced advis@@ or and maintenance costs were to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which was significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ized
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired , but some ob@@ servers are saying that it is in@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily kn@@ ives to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that ad@@ joins the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be painted in a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein .
the filters are in@@ experienced , in@@ trac@@ ting tools that produce more than 30 million selenium per day .
all the errors will arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn up in the past . in which they were accused of stim@@ ulate the app , Black@@ face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week a filter proposed a filter , who gave them sl@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , false teeth and un@@ ev@@ apor@@ ator car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; y@@ ellow@@ ing . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated contro@@ ver@@ si@@ es have referred to a larger problem that the company has di@@ vers@@ ity .
the News and Out@@ r@@ age were spread on Wednesday far , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have turned off the feature .
the company offered a sorry : the filter was intended to pay hom@@ age to the anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but foreign affairs which wit@@ ness@@ ed R@@ ass@@ is@@ sm@@ us remember@@ ed the filter of viol@@ ating clim@@ bers .
other len@@ ders op@@ ted the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail he wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student who have widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; wo@@ unded and m@@ ild@@ ly said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
it added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very resist@@ ible Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not rel@@ ent@@ ated , but that the y@@ ellow@@ ing of the y@@ ellow@@ ing is pulled extremely resistant .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that cros@@ ses this cultural stum@@ bling wi@@ red .
the American culture seems to be wrapped in a endless diversity and integral class , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older counter - might be more likely to expect increasing awareness .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters is a picture , &quot; it is so much more difficult for a user to stay un@@ noticed as it was before the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to er@@ ase your Snap@@ chat account against others to do the same .

military leadership of I@@ SIS secret services , provides the Committee of the Congress
military occupation of the United States Central Command changed ne@@ gle@@ cted information to reve@@ al an optim@@ istic picture of war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , then an investigation Committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the re@@ publi@@ can members of the military command , reported by great dis@@ satis@@ faction of Central Command Secret services that reported how su@@ peri@@ pher@@ als changed to the US struggle against the Islamic state .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News , Social Information , which were se@@ ized by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com Commander , typically have a positive picture of the US efforts against terror@@ ism as an analysis of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article published in this report .
&quot; what will happen at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analysis of our political leaders will be presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , represented a publi@@ can member of the Re@@ present@@ ative House .
the managers in the Cent@@ Com will reach the top top of the organization .
the 10 @-@ page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Ira@@ qi forces .
although there are no direct references to modify , the rule pointed out under Obama , shows how an@@ alysts have exposed the pressure from their pre@@ set , an optimum image of the thre@@ at of the Islamic State , also known as I@@ SIS or I@@ SIL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rele@@ ases , opinions and testim@@ on@@ ials were clearly positive than the facts , &quot; presented the report . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com members , belonging to a public , announced that a military re@@ conqu@@ ering Mos@@ sulph@@ s can start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after the months of investig@@ ations , so much clearly , &quot; says Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , re@@ publi@@ can congress of Kan@@ sas , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the peak Command was changed by the Central Command to record the risk of I@@ SIS in Iraq .
the Re@@ public@@ ans created the task force in the life after they were concerned that an@@ alysts were wor@@ ried about the manip@@ ulation of reports from the Islamic state .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings throughout the investigation .
further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are published by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense in the G@@ ange .
Democratic Members of the new@@ s@@ cour@@ te@@ as published their own findings with some of the concl@@ usions of the re@@ publi@@ can Task Force on Thursday .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com will create a highly restricted process for building implement@@ ing re@@ valuation in I@@ SIL , and the Ira@@ qi security services , and a member in the Re@@ present@@ ative House Adam B. Schiff , known in a statement .
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of up@@ setting services , &quot; fail@@ ures the mor@@ als under an@@ alysts , and &apos; was exc@@ essi@@ v@@ ely little space for different views . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats offered , no crit@@ ics to one of the White House at Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts on a &quot; certain political opinion &quot; have found .
preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
in recent August , the New York Times was reported by the Pentagon led by the Pentagon , following complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts .
according to C@@ md@@ r Patrick Evans , a press officer of the Pentagon , in a statement , gave no reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the general spec@@ tro@@ urs will be still ongoing .
but he also agreed that &quot; experts sometimes had di@@ verg@@ ent opinion regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence rel@@ ate a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al discussion of this important issues of national defence . &quot;
investig@@ ations have had a decisive impact on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that will be made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , during the last year , President Obama failed to leave military operations for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the critic@@ ism of secret information about the Islamic state rec@@ alls more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a correspondence in excess of George W. Bush against the recommendations of many an@@ alysts just saw a little time on the wall , having regard to the consequences of the inv@@ asion of 2003 thought .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebel@@ lion against the current reporting of the Islamic state .
last year , the team for Mr. Hoo@@ ker denied any significant effects on the loss of government cont@@ enders against the financial situation of TER@@ RO@@ RG@@ RU@@ PP@@ E , since this mak@@ esh@@ ift refin@@ eries have been put into service to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times recorded in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s @-@ then com@@ mander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ative of war with a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin was reti@@ ring in April . the Central Command was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won four @-@ fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , show@@ down show@@ down with Britain .
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American fiel@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match against India that the Americans won the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be a memor@@ able achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they don &apos;t know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are identical in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which followed after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meeting on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the sem@@ if@@ in@@ als , the game will decide which the two will take place in their group from six teams in the first and second place .
the first placed will be a bit longer from the way that the other group will start .
as always the game on Saturday , the Americans have trig@@ gered a surprising vor@@ tex , four years after having begun in the past London Games at the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time a ho@@ ckey stick in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years she became a National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they passed the Olympics in 2008 as it was not able to qualify for the ader .
then came the year 2012 , where her and her team did everything went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began making things better .
&quot; a culture change , mental change and physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work@@ horse in London that we now have .
we have ut@@ terly pl@@ uck up the rud@@ ders completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Torre@@ s in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near region .
India was without victory in the game , but the team showed spont@@ ane@@ ously and held the game status of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until they took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and lu@@ sted the ball in the gate around the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Melissa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a goal in each of the previous games ever .
it has a run .
exactly like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will be removed from the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wher@@ ever you are , too late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro feel constant and in@@ ev@@ itable , a rapid relay between competition and spre@@ ading .
it is , when the Olympic tor@@ ch himself is a burning staff , which is sufficient for athletes to cross Turner to the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t stop the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neigh@@ b@@ ors in the que@@ ue , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ gr@@ y or the dis@@ pute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and Ch@@ ad le C@@ los .
and then there is a log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , would certainly have been under this known name , which can be sent to Prime Time by sponsors und well @-@ feel @-@ TV advertisement if it would be a sw@@ immer , gymn@@ asts or even more fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic Flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not widely recognised : air@@ brush shooting , arch@@ ery , b@@ admin@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swim , and may have dom@@ inion over there .
but if I wanted to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline bed has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has happened so many that I had asked , didn &apos;t know that it is an Olympic and port@@ art .
this may also be regional Ign@@ or@@ anz .
although the United States sent athletes to competition , he has never won a medal in jumping on a trampoline and had made a athletes until 2012 , which made it to final round .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians are curious to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who want to share the women .
Dong Bell from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping on the trampoline has an out@@ break exterior , partly because it sounds in@@ ex@@ plan@@ ed ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ master school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only a happy enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never to be sw@@ ol@@ len - but also the gra@@ zie of the tournament and diving , the two sports that combines it in the essenti@@ ally .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; is written by the Spanish El trampoline , which means much means &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
emerging vic@@ tor jump on a gig@@ an@@ tic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ ays and Sal@@ tos ) before they end up at the feet .
it will be evaluated by the official Olympics of achievement , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two hundred and thirty athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are joined in Rio each other .
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ons ho@@ pes to continue in their qu@@ est to gold , faster , go up and over , sometimes till the finish , sometimes go and back , go up and down at the playground .
they h@@ unt not only the finish line or the starting point , but also in the television transmission again : the world or the Lord Lord .
the target ran@@ ged is no@@ bel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it &apos;s enough to stir@@ ring even a spect@@ ators .
but it &apos;s also what I feeling on watching the games as a bit f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ing .
there@@ with the trampoline offers a breathing .
the Vector of the trampoline is above .
a down@@ wards movement is not the aim .
he or she calls off , se@@ em@@ ingly heavy as a ast@@ ron@@ aut , desc@@ end up , then moved back to the above .
also here a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , not mer@@ cen@@ aries into the distance , just dre@@ amy , elegant up@@ lift of time and gravity .
it is as Zen how the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the women and final rounds of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympic mania they promise a calm , nice moment that will probably survive in general tum@@ ult .
if the consciousness can only be achieved by the attacks , and the an@@ tif@@ ication of male athletes can be achieved - as soon as the male US @-@ Turner reported prior to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his ring@@ ing to replace new fans .
&quot; a generation prot@@ est@@ icated &quot; in Ethiopia , Long A Al@@ lies of the USA
viol@@ ent prot@@ ests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , fell on viol@@ ent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that fier@@ y prot@@ est@@ ing during c@@ lashes with the police killed at Sh@@ uss@@ ine .
is Ethiopia straight together ?
in the past ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable country , a solid con@@ vers@@ aries of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , prot@@ ests against the government dev@@ oured the country and grew in increasingly more areas .
last week , thousands of people over@@ thre@@ w the streets and s@@ orts fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ mer@@ cif@@ ul according to human rights organization .
witnesses issued that polic@@ emen were killed on spar@@ kl@@ ing prot@@ esters and killed .
in circulation , videos can be found about prot@@ ests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people strike young people with sho@@ cks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Commission for Human Rights now demands an in@@ coming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to maintain this country and in future it will even be more difficult , &quot; said Rash@@ id Ab@@ di , the project leader of the horn of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelli@@ gence work closely together with Ethiopia , in order to fight terraces over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western assistance .
Ethiopia economy expanded in considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ st@@ ically improved - there is a new p@@ end@@ ulum type in Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was all another as a model for democracy - human rights organization continuously accepted the op@@ pression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , where@@ by dis@@ sid@@ ents have been taken into silence .
many were sent to ex@@ ile or jail , driven or driven into the past@@ or of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options besides , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth Protest@@ ant .
a generation prot@@ est@@ icated .
there are plenty of complaints that cover everything from the land use until your di@@ gn@@ ity in terms of power of the Co@@ alition .
after a moderate election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for these z@@ ack@@ ling , contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al line called by life in June hundreds of life .
analy@@ st fear , separ@@ atist@@ as such as the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the Og@@ ake , which were more or less comp@@ elled to explo@@ red the tur@@ bul@@ ence .
several factors explain why you want to explo@@ de the feeling of deter@@ i@@ oration after years of application under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiopia were able to communicate with social media , as cheap smartphones were increasingly common , and improved the Internet services .
even if the government faces the access to Facebook and Twitter , especially in regular distances , especially in prot@@ ests , many people can communicate with internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide themselves .
several young Ethiopia they gave rise to themselves to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest ethnic ias in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since Ethiopia , the Am@@ har@@ as pro@@ sp@@ ered from Ethiopia is mainly in politics and the economy , while they rent the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in Flach@@ land .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest prot@@ ests were held in the areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the sense that Ethiopia is un@@ fai@@ th@@ fully dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which are dominant about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the rest@@ ing is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death at a non @-@ public si@@ ck@@ ness in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiopia Prime Minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of corners .
an@@ alysts say that he was particularly licensed in having to perce@@ ive early signs of dis@@ satis@@ faction and special visits to edit oppon@@ ents and make them inno@@ cu@@ ous .
&quot; the current regime is missing in this basic skill , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiopia new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , has been selected from relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take up the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region in the north @-@ Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st say that he enjoys not the confidence of the Tig@@ ray @-@ controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more ble@@ eding .
the last time , Ethiopia , after thousands of elections , in 2005 , after thousands of elections pro@@ claimed , the government had se@@ eded and st@@ olen from the government .
during the following R@@ azz@@ ien many Protest@@ ants were killed , even if less than in recent months and those days of the up@@ heav@@ als were quite fast .
major development experts in Ethiopia leaders of their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new p@@ end@@ ulum , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress on poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the inten@@ sif@@ ying of internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ est@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , carried out business in and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray is always more common in social media .
analy@@ st say that prot@@ ests can bring the USA and other western allies into an independent position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for dr@@ on flights over the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even if they recently had closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to collap@@ se in an already vol@@ atile area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin she@@ aths . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es Obama &apos;s claim and Obama was founded in I@@ SIS . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump trying to dis@@ per@@ se the last con@@ si@@ al to dis@@ per@@ se his campaign that his repeat@@ edly re @-@ repeated claims , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton , who would have been the fo@@ unders &quot; of TER@@ RO@@ RG@@ RU@@ PP@@ E Islamic State , not seriously .
this clar@@ ification thre@@ w new questions to the communication skills of the pre@@ sidential nom@@ dates of the Re@@ public@@ ans , whether he should be able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his fellow leaders to take him while an event@@ ful phase in protection , to have the actual position in which he could not have meant to be meant .
after he made the announcement of the evening event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made back to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and continu@@ ance in interviews that he really did not intended to work , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created I@@ SIS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he is simply sol@@ astic .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a number of interviews that Mr. Tr@@ ump told me to be completely serious .
as the conserv@@ ative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , wanted to destroy the re@@ publi@@ can pre@@ sidential candidate .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que jumping on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he attemp@@ ts the focus of his campaign to focus on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked for spe@@ e@@ ches to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump trying again to return to this topic .
about Twitter always war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead suggest@@ ions to higher taxes , and that he found their speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump already brought Sar@@ kas@@ mus to his defense .
at the end of July , he moved to his strong critic@@ ism , as he said , the Rus@@ sians should make Mrs. Clin@@ tons En@@ amel , but later he said &quot; Of course I said the Sar@@ cast@@ ically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the l@@ ingu@@ istic borders in politics and then go back to your needs .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages of his fans are taken , as they arrive , and then &quot; clear &quot; depending on how the reaction drops . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication examination , that observed the language of both candidates .
but I think he is cle@@ ver enough to keep his failure v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpre@@ ted in several ways .
instead of the sound for the pre@@ sidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even bur@@ ial tone since his survey@@ s have gone on .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head racing in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is trying to avoid exc@@ use for his prov@@ oc@@ ating declar@@ ations , he puts his crit@@ ics often to understand or understand his testim@@ on@@ ies .
but during the last months of his pre@@ sidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Jo@@ ze presents his loy@@ al fellow in the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ oc@@ ative his statements may also be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former may@@ or of New York and one of the most prominent princip@@ alities to defend the candidates in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says is leg@@ itim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps was asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had created the Islamic state .
it is true in this sense that Obama I@@ SIS was an almost unknown , small organisation , and he called her back@@ ben@@ chers , completely wrong and so did it happened , because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most Ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am re@@ publi@@ can try to argue that the government was under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an Foreign Minister , I@@ SIS was to spread out broad@@ ly by bringing about the situation in the Middle East .
prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and thre@@ w them on each of his words to fight against him .
he en@@ de@@ fied the poor , em@@ mer@@ ic &quot; television hex@@ ade@@ my who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t do it . &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ott@@ les over Mr. Tr@@ umps exc@@ use than just another evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the Pre@@ sidential office .
once upon the price of the market , Café is back in green@@ point
ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ by café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , which one could only pay cash , which was not able to pay Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years a good coffee .
of course , the prices of its Bedford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed .

the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also a new setting .
in the last November a re @-@ revi@@ val caf@@ e opened in green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original site .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is also still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ year employee of the old caf@@ es , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ es .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new branch office , he was exc@@ ited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , fulfilled a lot .
Ver@@ b used the same Distri@@ butor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ by@@ ist model .
they even use the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wich@@ es with bacon and cheese and there are Garn@@ ets like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural fe@@ ars .
the café offers no beer more , there are fresh juice for it .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed an aston@@ ished power to old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed back by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Horn was such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived near Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after having drawn to the green@@ point , it would take the way out .
after the closing had closed , she gave birth to a while , she said .
&quot; I became clear that it was found in the coffee and culture of the Ver@@ b , which was saying to me , &quot; she said .
now they drink coffee , even if they made Coff@@ ee@@ Ch@@ ai Tea day instead of the usual I@@ ced Coff@@ s Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ time and loy@@ al customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .

today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he turns his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said he has no gro@@ ll on it , that the soap store has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ fired coffee of the coffee as a ingre@@ dient .
&quot; I think we will go on her offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .

the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , after his asc@@ en@@ sion to the President Franklin Del@@ ano Roos@@ evelt took his lunch in the oval Office .
as a g@@ our@@ met , President Roos@@ evelt became a Fa@@ ible for refined del@@ ic@@ ac@@ ies at Fif@@ th Avenue , like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water@@ sk@@ ating soup .
his menu on that day was a hum@@ ble : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and des@@ sert a pl@@ um pu@@ d@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act with culinary solidarity with qui@@ re@@ ty people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn &apos;s Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was hon@@ ed by the Chinese cuisine in the US , while Z@@ iegel@@ man tells in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about the life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A permanent meal , &quot; will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per publishing , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the great de@@ pression .
they showed culinary del@@ ights when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop to meet dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ gy I@@ mb@@ iss in the Flat@@ iron District , which has been part of the market since the market share in 1929 .
Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cream tar@@ iff with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Turkey , with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable soup .
when the Re@@ porter Sch@@ ro@@ wed , this set the couple in a discussion about the food in the era of Great De@@ pression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ anu@@ t bread , liver lo@@ af and bean bread .
they have been prepared for an ingre@@ dient and a bit in@@ expensive to strike the ingre@@ dient .
imagine how many pe@@ an@@ uts are to eat that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; it must be in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years prior to Great De@@ pression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet .
the teams of women co@@ ves for male field workers and it was served freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans that sent to an hung@@ arian food in the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the way to which the country was going to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland to .
&quot; it was a time in eating for the Americans a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; committed Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
it was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ len were converted to basic food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as &quot; wonderful kind , Es@@ sens@@ re@@ ste , &quot; noticed Z@@ iegel@@ man , da Kö@@ che could hide un@@ app@@ et@@ ite ingredients among a kre@@ p@@ ent sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry saus@@ age .
meat , the year of the centre of American cuisine was a very rare luxury .
such mix@@ tures were tried out , since a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing pre@@ f@@ ying prec@@ ed@@ ence had prec@@ ed@@ ented to taste or even healthy food .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ anu@@ t butter .
&quot; it was not any supplement at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and fried onions are not fit .
it was typical for many of economic recipes .
as never before or since then , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated mer@@ chan@@ ts - including Louise Stan@@ ley , director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the hab@@ its of the country is qui@@ et@@ ly .
by talking about recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encour@@ aged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary bud@@ dies &quot; and the challenge , P@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
a square Me@@ al is a feast of historical ti@@ d@@ bits .
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to an hung@@ ered citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ E@@ ating .
while he publicly produced the simple I@@ owa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen , he made one of the billi@@ on@@ ful@@ ness man of the world , to whom he became .
&quot; he liked contin@@ ental cuisine like fish with cu@@ c@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and wor@@ e a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful to reality .
President Roos@@ evelt would have had the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute an upright post@@ mark .
as described in the book , in case of a house with no interest in flavors of Ms. Roos@@ evelt , the White House brought the boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most advanced food prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great de@@ pression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is based on our advanced focus on calories and food , said Z@@ iegel@@ man , as well as science on food was applied .
the couple was in writing to have understood the eating hab@@ its of Z@@ iegel@@ man &apos;s mother in law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ man remember@@ ed : &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ mill .
after the plat@@ ter at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were cle@@ ared , they drew up a des@@ sert , which she prepared at home : the pl@@ um , the President Roos@@ evelt .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une Wh@@ ip , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a üb@@ ner tri@@ ck was , mod@@ est recipes to miss a nice name .
there were no wh@@ ipped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ pping somewhat resist@@ ive a spoon in the teeth , brown Gli@@ mp@@ se .
lu@@ ck@@ ily it was not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a supplement .
as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed by Bom@@ bs @-@ Attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the Hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar is devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is dead at a Fass@@ bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence , which killed about 6@@ 0,000 people around the world so far .
2900 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers leave their own life to go to people from bom@@ bed houses , and to make the first help .
they are her@@ oes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of c@@ ivil@@ ization that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour res@@ cu@@ ing of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the radi@@ ant symbo@@ lic figure in the building of the war .
as a her@@ oes , he never seen himself , said : &quot; for me , this is the real Jih@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; if I am dying , I think God would think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before Omar fell vic@@ tim to the vic@@ tim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the hel@@ oc@@ op@@ ter spoke four barrel bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia District , which was filled with ch@@ org@@ as .

Greenland : the oldest sp@@ ine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland usually come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k took us back on the abo@@ ard of the S@@ anna &apos;s research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good one km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland just got young for 150 years .
due to the North Atlantic , Greenland , the Greenland &apos;s foundation is just 1.@@ 220 meters , in an hour .
only when it goes up , acceler@@ ates the five meters long be@@ ast to 2.5 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
that of long @-@ sol@@ ving lifestyle seems to be an industrial concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen , at the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any part of a Greenland , who could be 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; ented Alexander s@@ cour@@ ing from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock which means a world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
although the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tionary bi@@ ologe has long been long to be st@@ oned in Greenland .
only the evidence was lack@@ ing .
Greenland &apos;s se@@ pul@@ ls are difficult to observe , last@@ ly , they live in the Eis@@ meer in front of the spar@@ sely pop@@ ulated coastal areas of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they usually occur in the surface only in winter .
expl@@ or@@ er researchers know about the lifestyle of Greenland .
their time track sn@@ akes up they , as they conce@@ aled six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
pre@@ y make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , and another one had sw@@ allowed to bone a young ice bear .
possibly they sleep sleeping animals or pat@@ ro@@ pack at the bottom of the ice cream and search the Kad@@ aver that tor@@ ches out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues , 28 Greenland was tried to catch the fisher@@ men between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard , as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ ers long , the biggest 502 cen@@ timet@@ ers size .
to determine the age of animals , they analyse the line @-@ core of the shar@@ k with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens already emerg@@ es before the birth of the shar@@ ks which are contained in the presence of proteins later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had so much carbon @-@ 14 in lens nucleus .
her birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when atom@@ ic cycles try greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in contrast to 220 cen@@ timet@@ ers length of third smallest animal , the len@@ tic@@ es contained a low dist@@ en@@ tion of carbon @-@ 14 from the atom@@ ic aff@@ ord , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in their lens , all larger Greenland , however , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 o &apos;clock showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timet@@ res long Greenland at the age of 335 , while the record shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ timet@@ res should be a 392 years old .
the Greenland @-@ female , Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females finally get offspring if they are longer than four metres , was known .
the researchers of the length were able to as@@ sign an age .
since one of the animals with 392 cen@@ timet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold for sex@@ ually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland itself has obviously taken over a half centuries of time .
this should also be the world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
that there is no co@@ inc@@ idence that such meth@@ us@@ al use mainly live in icy waters , is no co@@ inc@@ idence .
even the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland , in his bacon a 120 year old har@@ poon tip was caught before Alaska .
through the low temperatures often the organ@@ ism of living animals still runs on as@@ cor@@ rosive environments .
so they mature quickly - and s@@ wor@@ s s@@ lower .
in order to keep warm , the animals are often very big in the cold water .
the volume grows much faster than its surface , thanks to the animal warm@@ th .
the heat loss of a gram Mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of Ele@@ ph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives in more dangerous and should focus on keeping as many desc@@ endants as early as possible , &quot; explains the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ att@@ lein as early as possible .
a very large animal should rather invest its resources in long life .

&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the key field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether to keep money from London &apos;s financial transactions in the entire EU .

Clin@@ tons to earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % Federal
Hill@@ ary Clinton has published their tax on Friday on Friday , and submitted an income for the pre@@ sidential elections in 2015 and their husband received a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal Government tax of 34,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons USD 1 million ended for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton achieved an income of USD 3 million in Re@@ de@@ hon@@ orary ; the former Foreign Minister appointed Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons is the vice @-@ president for the vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ a from Virginia , published his tax ex@@ plan@@ ations for the last ten years .
they paid a effective Federal Tax@@ ation rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; gave to Clin@@ tons Camp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ in Jenn@@ ifer Palm@@ ieri in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump h@@ ides behind the talking and trac@@ ers in terms of his promises to publish his controllers .
it is common to publish its tax ex@@ plan@@ ations for U.S. pre@@ sidential statements , although they are not committed by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York busin@@ ess@@ man , and his lawyers were given as a reason for ref@@ using a tax authentic@@ ation .
&quot; you are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons elec@@ he@@ d@@ hel@@ in Ian SA@@ MS on Twitter , regarding the publication of the pre@@ sidential candidate .
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Ad@@ visor , CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before the control test does not complete .
Tr@@ ying crit@@ ics , among others , the re@@ publi@@ can sidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already tru@@ sted in terms of assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , its business cards and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already expressed himself on the subject and on Friday a video in the internet , which became the highest ranking of Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish its tax statement .
on Thursday she spoke to the topic of a speech in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what other pre@@ sidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; she said to the crowd .
POLI@@ TI@@ CO reported that Tr@@ ump has been paid for two years no or just very little taxes , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quot@@ ed a number of tax an@@ wäl@@ te and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Bundes@@ taxes are become a subject in election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation , which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and invest@@ or War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , that would ensure that people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign meeting of Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week of Omaha , Ne@@ bras@@ ka asked buff@@ ett , whose Berk@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate here has his seat , tr@@ ump to exchange their tax ex@@ plan@@ ations .
Buff@@ ett said , he was also sub@@ jected to the tax authentic@@ ation of IR@@ S and tr@@ ump in fear of vot@@ ers and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ tons &quot; campaign has returned fiscal policy until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who live now in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal Tax@@ ation rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the declaration of tax of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that this is only USD 100 of its income as a sal@@ ary , unlike most of the Americans .
their main cash system was an in@@ expensive index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ d@@ ends and yiel@@ ds USD 109@@ ,000 .

Jewish director propos@@ es Berlin Hotel because Israeli elections were sub@@ jected to &quot; Arab &quot; collection - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots dig a media show , after he had betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin no Israeli elections listed , since there were Arabic guests , according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; ordered his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by taking an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann kept Israel to find on the list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be called directly from the hotel rooms .
what is it possible in Berlin in 2016 , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been elim@@ inated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via a private call center .
according to a declaration , the director turned to the hotel .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; how Lanz@@ man wrote .
the hotel mentioned that the measure has a &quot; obvious decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel itself . &quot;
the reason , behind this , dissolved in the director more W@@ ut .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they demands that the pre @-@ election will be removed , &quot; the employee was cited by Lanz@@ mann .
the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Had@@ as @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were de@@ composed and troubled about this event .
this is really very embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing .
the fact that this in Germany contributed to this hotel chain , is even an even bigger one .
this does not need the need for any explanation .
we expect that the Hotel &quot; puts the right concl@@ usions , &quot; said the ministers .
the inc@@ ident trig@@ gered a pretty big reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called the whole sc@@ and@@ al .
some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel published it to have given the alleg@@ ed collection of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; be ash@@ amed , &quot; it was supposed to be in another post , in which it was referred to that the hotel is located at the class@@ y Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue .
the hotel clearly rejected all acc@@ us@@ ations from themselves and called the inc@@ ident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct command , &quot; not to record Israel in the evaluation level , &quot; the Southern German newspaper quot@@ ed a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds to the country code to be added .

trading between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the Russian amb@@ assador in Iran , Le@@ van D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teh@@ er@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanc@@ tions against Iran , the interest in pages of Russian companies grew strongly in the country , divided by the amb@@ assador .
Russian companies have existing links with Iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , another trading company is one of the biggest pri@@ or@@ ities of bil@@ ateral co @-@ operation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran have risen by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran , rising to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ assador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of I@@ ran@@ ian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign deployment out about 35@@ .000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with travel vis@@ as , I@@ ran@@ ian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the tourist quantity in Russia .
one could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists broke out in Russia last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Rus@@ sians visits Iran , something that ho@@ pes that it is going to change .
&quot; I personally recommend the visit to the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the old Per@@ sian c@@ ivil@@ ization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

gr@@ otto Call@@ um Sk@@ inner to@@ pp@@ ies at home , as ro@@ ast gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s largest last night in the man@@ or team in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio towards the f@@ ame when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor of his fellow country@@ man , Sir Chris Ho@@ y celebrated his legend , when he hur@@ ri@@ ded home to home a victory from the New Zealand .
in England four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cked win during Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the tri@@ ck after they were in March by train world championships in London despite the withdrawal Ho@@ ys only a mod@@ est sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the subst@@ itute for Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried by K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man , when they stayed , when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots , which now un@@ fol@@ ds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the past four years ago with Ho@@ y vic@@ tor@@ ious - and Sk@@ inner jump@@ ed in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ings , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders were winning in the first round .
and the British trio won the fight with gold .
after his turn back barely back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner kept it .
a strategy changes made a major part of the transformation , in the execution of a higher course to slow down it and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to maintain the pace .
Ho@@ y saw it from his position as BBC expert and did Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium .
the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name for me .
around the final round , we have placed an Olympic marina and defeated the world champion .
it was simply incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the tri@@ umph in 2012 on the page of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys stood there , that after a weak start fell down on the railway line .
he returned this statement later and there was no contra@@ diction of Engl@@ ands Riv@@ als .
such a superior victory there was no problem for this time .
Hin@@ des said : &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the trib@@ une as London . &quot;
we came together as a team in the last three months .
we came so bad@@ ly at so much World tit@@ els so it was incredible to win back during the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that were won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London .
if a bar@@ ometer is our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is possible in the area of the Pos@@ sible , that he repeated the victory of three Olympic medals in a competition .
this would be used for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a shining date for the British sport ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister ) were awarded a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cage of Ho@@ y same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint race , which begins today and will go over three days .
28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels quite lon@@ ely , to win alone .
Hin@@ des said , &quot; When he wins two gold medals , he should be defeated a kn@@ ight . &quot;
it was the only med@@ allion competition in the day but there was another good news for England .
Sir Brad@@ ly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 942 on the target .
the world record , who won gold in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the race , where W@@ ig@@ gins won the focus on behalf of the W@@ ig@@ gins .
he was cont@@ ested yesterday with the accused , as offici@@ als of the qualification , to measure his body size .
in the speaking world competition , the morning continued , and finished , av@@ anc@@ ied Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Arch@@ ib@@ ald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team re@@ lies on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the medium period of the Olympic Games and to catch a shadow of medals .
after a truly outstanding representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down .
they played in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical chief of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton , in April , surrounded by sex music and bul@@ lying cont@@ actors as well as reti@@ rement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees itself the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite after that the now legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at a perfect moment , will again be repeated .
future of the melt of Portland because of raising the energy agreement un@@ question@@ able
the future of aluminum mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - well as an hundred jobs of workers - are on the game , since the plant operator termin@@ ate the power supply and thus ass@@ essed all delivery contracts , as the sup@@ plying energy companies included .
this move followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further sub@@ si@@ dies to be commissioned .
one for 20 years of fest@@ ive sub@@ si@@ dy passes in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alco@@ a in Portland stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs , direct as well as indirect - could be end@@ ang@@ ered at closing time .
in addition , it could be consumed by domin@@ o@@ effects as the melt accounts for around 10 per cent of the total generation of Vic@@ tor@@ ias .
in 2014 , Alco@@ a received the Point Henry melting , which led to the closing of An@@ gles@@ ea power station .
the melt of Alco@@ a in Portland loses money and ris@@ eth a shut down .
this step follows the lon@@ gl@@ ands spec@@ ulations in terms of the future of the complex , originally as a result of the powerful Australian dollar , and last@@ ly due to the current price list .
AG@@ L , which is the large aluminum mel@@ ts with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared with it that three other owners are going to cancel their contracts .
the plant is in the majority of a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , where Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p shares are content .
&quot; AG@@ L is going to run out that the plant in Portland continued to operate , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting rate , &quot; granted the company .
AG@@ L said that the contracts for the so @-@ called &quot; backup business &quot; are to be entered into force in November 2016 .
the contracts mark a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forec@@ asts of strong sales markets for large retail prices .
AG@@ L has reported that it has already written the value of the Tre@@ ati@@ es in its yearly turnover of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the tre@@ ati@@ es is to run the &quot; ability Alco@@ as ... the melt &quot; or does not affect the melting point .
the US company said that it was a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have completed this year in effect from November this year , even if a statement is found , why it came from the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ ns of the bad economic conditions in front of the possible closing of the city &apos;s possible closing time in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysis of the analy@@ st in the beginning of the week , the Head of Oper@@ ations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume around 600 meg@@ aw@@ atts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ aw@@ atts of electricity every year .
if both plants from the market would dis@@ appear , it would mean a considerable increase in demand on the &#91; Current market &#93; .
and for us it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a card@@ ash@@ ian reality TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the last edition of the Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ian and mother of the card@@ ash@@ ian @-@ J@@ enner Cl@@ ans Kri@@ s is on the cover of the cov@@ eted American Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador for E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and on the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , inspired me the view of this co@@ vers to W@@ einen , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a biz@@ arre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the card@@ ash@@ ian @-@ J@@ om@@ nant ) as well as to the presence of your sister @-@ Show@@ biz and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the sole favorite show@@ biz of Se@@ ac@@ rest , which ends the cover of her sister and that with a classical engraving : you all have a surprise @-@ party .
that puts the ice cream det@@ en@@ tion of a children &apos;s birthday ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , with hon@@ esty of a animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kri@@ s had to take part her other girl somehow on this publi@@ city .
with regard to the new edition of Vog@@ ue , Vog@@ ue has started a new era in Kard@@ ash@@ ians .
K@@ end@@ all big sister Kim likes her to see what the Vog@@ ue Cover is beaten ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) but the cover of the magazine is a league for itself .
the new edition for Vog@@ ue is the most widely sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference which is rather res@@ em@@ bles as a fashion journal , the issue attrac@@ ts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( according to L@@ aut F@@ ashion@@ ista ) by the 8@@ 32 pages of the woods .
the unve@@ iling of its Cover@@ stars is predic@@ ted that in the last two years , the magazine appeared before the official announcement of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years more &quot; Fam@@ ous He@@ arts , the Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
the Oscar @-@ Award Jenn@@ ifer Lawrence was on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the small chance that Ms. J@@ enner - is described by the magazine as the &quot; break@@ down model &quot; of her generation - under the previous category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to those famous people or reality stars or ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents from today , you know how to convert a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to in@@ separ@@ ator ) .
they are really tal@@ ented women who are portra@@ yed in the entertainment industry .
Bey@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade , one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , Jenn@@ ers don &apos;t like success .
Jenn@@ ifer &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something stra@@ ined with their reality TV history .
in June , the introduc@@ tory Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colle@@ ague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and named them &quot; the mist@@ ress of the eye &quot;
these feelings co@@ ves back up again when the message came with the appearance Jenn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but to spread on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass on the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the last edition of the Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it is advertising for your pri@@ ming of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you images from their respective Pay@@ wall @-@ Apps .
sold by her made images of C@@ ind@@ y CRA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to love the magazine LOVE .
and in their free time she is shown in the reality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
16@@ 0,000 people annually visit par@@ c@@ eption .
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s char@@ ities have been rejected by the Municipal Mach@@ ining Cent@@ ers annually , while the branch is on the impact on over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three of five people - mostly older persons , immig@@ rants , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ging and similar - in their looking for free legal advice and legal advice .
legal services of the community , which are already fully functional , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is en@@ vis@@ aged that it will lose further 30 percent of its federal resources .
the director of the municipal council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of Municipal @-@ Order Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people had been rejected by people every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only become worse by the decision of the federal government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Con@@ spir@@ acy programs are chron@@ ically financed , which means that thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who have viol@@ ent relation@@ ships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive deb@@ ts , families who were dis@@ missed by divi@@ des - all these people have problems in legal way - that they can &apos;t get the help you need .
the federal government is short@@ ened to 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of people need to be forced to help people from Que@@ ens@@ land without any help .
we call for the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Affairs and the Federal Minister of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis that these mid@@ i @-@ bre@@ vi@@ ations can immediately get the help that you need to get in legal problems .
last year , the state government filled its commitment to raise funds for legal conditions at the national average .
it is now at the time to look at the needs of the municipal service centres and their customer relationship , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign successfully charged when employees allegedly became a weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign has been indicted for alleg@@ ed in@@ action in February when you have indicated that their campaign manager for North Carolina was directed to a staff who were travelling in a Jeep in February .
the inc@@ ident was described in an indictment that was submitted on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program for the campaign in this state of state .
Bord@@ ini gave us to have been waiting for months that the issue would be un@@ regulated , before he realized that &quot; it would not happen . &quot;
the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; moved to the print , placed his right po@@ inter on the print , and minim@@ ize the run in Vinc@@ enzo Kn@@ ie@@ k@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his indictment .
after having compl@@ ained at the local and regional struggle leadership , Bord@@ ini noted that at least four others , he had already done the same experience with Philli@@ p , he was filed in the Indi@@ ct@@ ment .
&quot; weapons must not be de@@ emed to fire , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini to damage . &quot;
the prosec@@ ution only occurs two days after the Republi@@ can sidential candidate in North Carolina , said that &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - Sh@@ or@@ s@@ aff@@ en@@ land@@ lord and Ar@@ en@@ fre@@ unde - measures should take place in case of his Riv@@ al@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Tr@@ umps campaign clearly noted that the media would have had his words from the context and that he would not force ma@@ je@@ ure .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for viol@@ ation of the care worker , and Philip because of body injury and lead of sil@@ ky damage .
umps in Hope H@@ icks didn &apos;t get to achieve a statement .
try to contact Philip and just lack@@ ing .
W@@ CC@@ B , a local news show in Charlotte , reports that Philli@@ p is no longer working for the campaign .
on calls at his consulting companies , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the re@@ publi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has led to a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al campaign so far .

Berlin / Schwerin : pol@@ l of the EU Ele@@ ctions : SPD and CD@@ U L@@ ose
with the following elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and the CD@@ U government const@@ itution .
this is representative inqu@@ iries of the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government co@@ alition could barely go on in the north , this is not possible after the survey@@ s in Berlin .
in both states the SPD would have the strongest party and would have a good chance to keep the government offici@@ als .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD fell by 15.@@ 6 percent in five years ago to 24 percent .
according to pol@@ l , the party only remains just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could go back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
on 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens , despite slight losses with 6 per cent ( prior to 8.7 percent ) , in spite of slight losses .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
by the Berlin Chamber of De@@ pu@@ ties , the SPD de@@ pol@@ led by only 23 percent ( the election year 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are therefore still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the Left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 per cent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Euro MP@@ s with 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pir@@ ates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and t@@ aller , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ ck .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would reach today for about two selenium .
an iPhone is now supplied with a minimum of 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , fans can still buy equipment on the Internet , but they somehow come from the rock life of the Internet .
however , 20 years ago , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; Office in the West@@ ent@@ rop format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a number : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was able to reach .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browser , if so slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available to a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be looked like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and black @-@ white @-@ screen found .
rather proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , thus approx . 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was € 392 in 2015 .
no one could see in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the wireless tele@@ phones are a success story , if not Nokia .
the cell map of the Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
today the market still domin@@ ates provider , which came to Nokia much later .
always and everywhere be online , this is a lot of everyday life today .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion devices have been sold to Samsung and Apple are just 555 million units .
the global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running business of the count@@ less app providers and t@@ elec@@ oms operators are coming .
in the meantime , around the smartphone is an entire industry .
the decisive break@@ through to the mass market came first in 2007 , then the Apple b@@ oss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Phones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and a Internet Commun@@ ic@@ ator , all to operate with touch screen .
the tri@@ umph@@ al train of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had to look after .
she disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ intellig@@ ible for 20 years after its invention .
today every German man looks for 88 times a day on the phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , &quot; said in the Siemens Executive Board .
permanent he@@ igh@@ t@@ ility is now considered as a cur@@ se and bl@@ ess@@ ings .
England must focus the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
for me , the biggest attrac@@ tion He@@ ath@@ rows was , exactly as it was in London in 2012 when we operate a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from gam@@ bling .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be reached again by creating new opportunities for local and local companies .
in our local communities , we will already deliver 10,000 new teachers to create 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of expansion of He@@ ath@@ rows will be too large .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate us at the world stage .
the dou@@ b@@ ors had been wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every answer to it .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ness@@ ing growth and use a legacy of skills and employment both in order to leave the airport as well as in whole GB .
we have constructed a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which was implemented a £ 11 bn of infrastructure invested in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport operating terminal was built , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two busy run@@ way .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
London &apos;s London games were a great success for GB and I am conf@@ ident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is also one of them .
it is time for we to expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row and establish our future trading and create a legacy of pre@@ val@@ ences and employment that England can be proud of that .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Mouse @-@ Game &quot; for Indi@@ cation
for companies who earn money with online advertising are straight , according to a software manufacturer attemp@@ ts , display support , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook was announced that it would block ad blocks on his desktop page , released Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ ger to which users may update their filters in the program to block advertis@@ ements in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared the coding of coding in its advertising for the coding of advertising for its advertis@@ ements would be recogn@@ iz@@ able , which is part of the page advertising is to be seen .
but Ad@@ block pro@@ claimed that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that this sort of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle has been between the an@@ ze@@ lock Open Source Community and the remo@@ ver since the invention of ad bun@@ dles in the g@@ utter is , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s biggest company has left the world &apos;s largest media in the battle , is a powerful Indi@@ z for how poss@@ essed advertising p@@ ants are developed for the industry .
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe , there are around 200 million people charged their advertis@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1,@@ 03 billion daily users of active users who access fac@@ ebook over their mobile devices , mobile advertising is 84 percent of the world &apos;s rating .
the company has seen it on advertis@@ ers on Desktop PC , since mobile ad lock@@ ers no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PC makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook seems as a re@@ warding for such a ste@@ pper .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared his &quot; ad pre@@ fer@@ enz@@ en@@ tool &quot; to update the people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blo@@ c would have had new filters , because they would also block contents on the side which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
advertising p@@ ants are a st@@ ump means that &apos;s why we focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead , to put out more control in the hands of the people .
woman with assumed su@@ icide on Swiss motorway
the vic@@ tim was in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police inv@@ ests witnesses after performing a woman in the early hours of morning on Thursday with susp@@ ected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the inc@@ ident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman placed himself in a dark in an act of des@@ pair . &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a silence is aged 49 , which was handed over by several vehicles including a lor@@ ry , to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been collected yet , some are still not identified , the police said these as well as any witnesses of the inc@@ ident to report .
a conc@@ ili@@ ation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , granted G@@ illes Court @-@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however it remains to be waiting if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a C@@ lash avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosec@@ utor had to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two other similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be drawn to respon@@ si@@ bly .
in each of the two cases , one person in the dark runs on the free@@ way - was decided that the drivers have not to go out that there is a pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an in the middle of the night , like it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ e@@ woman of the neg@@ ligent killing was acqu@@ itted after she had killed a man and was killed in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year old vic@@ tim had dr@@ unk and has become conscious of the road , and took the judgment .
the court noted that police officers had responded to a call -- which was in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; perfect and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has a further information about the inc@@ ident on Thursday near Morges , should sign up at the police at number 021 6@@ 44 83 46 or 021 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate change : Venus once was hab@@ itable
according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model , Venus were probably inhabit@@ able .
scientists at the God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the history of the Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms which res@@ em@@ ble from climate policies .
the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have been proven to have similar conditions .
scientists have earlier pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their density atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , inher@@ ited atmosphere and slowly improved .
the model also illumin@@ ated the topo@@ graphy of early Venus .
the planet de@@ votes out more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and geograph@@ ic vari@@ ability to give life and saf@@ egu@@ ard life against life .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a Sun , which was 30 percent of a matter .
&quot; in the CI@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus its daily side of the sun was almost two months long , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io stated in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , causing a umbrella to get the surface of much of the sunlight .
the result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of the Venus that res@@ em@@ bles the evolution that previously carried out by Planet@@ en@@ searched .
although they probably had hab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed .
their oc@@ eans has ev@@ apor@@ ated and your water vap@@ or was dist@@ illed from ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen dropped only a thick atmosphere on carbon dioxide , with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
the researchers gave the results of its new Venus climate analy@@ zer in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che .
alternatively , the President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and acknowle@@ dged that the association will immediately be searching for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey oper@@ ations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and destination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy was expressed in a statement .
I thought more about it during the summer and thought how I could improve this team to l@@ end more depth and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the trainer of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a certain vote on decisions that affect the performance of the team .
currently , these conditions are not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who returned in Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick today informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him all the best for the future .
in the debut season of the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was awarded the winner of the league &apos;s best coach in the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he introduced the association to 112 points and in front of the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed in every last two years the low season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in Western Conference by five points .
the Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart won four Stan@@ ley Cu@@ ps -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers again take con@@ vers@@ ations to put strike in
the work strug@@ gles concerning the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ ers were suspended , while all disp@@ utes were put to the table , a negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil campaign services Wood Group have been performed spor@@ adi@@ c on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the un@@ ite and r@@ m unions can confirm that we have agreed to start the winding process of current spre@@ ading , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop some whole day meetings in the coming weeks that will start the start of the next year to re@@ start the problems .
the unions told that their last strike that the first in more than 25 years is , a protest against possible wage short@@ ages of up to 30 percent be .
this year , wood Group has been short@@ ened to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company has a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that extra short@@ cuts to the company need the required space to get through the market .
shell has released for its part of thousands of people and has announced plans , his oil and gas business activities were up to 10 countries as a result of its proce@@ eding from the UK Energy Company BG Group .
energy companies are based on lower break@@ down prices under pressure , an economic situation based on the decision of the British in June to for@@ s@@ aken the European Union .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers at the beginning of this week , to discuss one of the greatest works in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just for few works , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in expenditure for new projects in the North Sea are expected to be an average of around $ 7 billion over the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ ry of the fac@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has been helping to gather the complete catalogue of rotor rates under the stars of the star@@ ry .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating at different banks and in which the rot@@ ational time periods are connected with the planetary observ@@ ations .
&quot; we hope that we experience through the compar@@ ing of our results with other star@@ ry , more about the relationship between the mass of a con@@ stellation , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a re@@ sear@@ cher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades lies just 445 Licht@@ jahre der Earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation origin@@ ated from about 125 million years ago , now ad@@ ress the ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood .
now you are turning the fastest .
peak rot@@ ations of imp@@ lic@@ ate these real star large amounts of star@@ ving .
since these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a brake effect on stars .
if a star is sh@@ aken , his rot@@ ational speed begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by taking the time between the appearance of a con@@ sens@@ able star clu@@ cks -- as the sun spot -- recognize .
the latest catalogue of rotary @-@ rates indicates that massive stars are lower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull represents the stars with d@@ ancers , the bigger stars lower s@@ lower Pi@@ rou@@ ds turn as smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be more bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star@@ ry of the ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ m@@ ic laboratory to compare adjust@@ ments qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades of the Ple@@ j@@ ades has a anch@@ ors for theoretical models of the adjustable rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still a lot before us what we want to know more about how , when and why stars will slow down their ro@@ les rates down and so@@ w their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the fac@@ ial rates of Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al Bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ Star occurs from
with Alex Rodri@@ guez , te@@ ars went faster than the U.S. bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ Star in the best days of base .
on 12 August , after his emotional re@@ sign@@ ation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear to the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays , which will bear the tri@@ cot of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participants in the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
in three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the league &apos;s most valuable player , in 2009 he won the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature is 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and Youth coach in the future .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a time with power .
with 696 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) and the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es succeeded in creating a few mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays only refer to two additional bas@@ eb@@ all players in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the b@@ ite hall of bas@@ eb@@ all .
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field , it &apos;s a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al appearance outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was taken to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games in the so @-@ called Bi@@ ogen@@ esis @-@ Sc@@ and@@ al by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the chief sus@@ pic@@ ious , lon@@ gl@@ omer@@ ang upon an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida to receive performance .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 en@@ counters .
&quot; the League could even have had one vessel for the year 2014 , because I had played 20 years without a break , Rodri@@ guez said that sweet .
his de@@ port@@ ing day do not run noise .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ leg@@ ends in their last games even play the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a shooting tour . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ w@@ ia Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first d@@ oping waste
hit : for a positive Dop@@ ing sample , weight the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland should not start .
Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro - The 2016 Olympic Games will over@@ ride the first official d@@ oping cases .
a proved Ath@@ let@@ in would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition , the first official d@@ oping cases are known for the Olympic Games in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro .
the Chinese pig@@ s in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ m obst@@ acle course in Sil@@ w@@ ia Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weights , Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical hits this news .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ az@@ ide has been proven to have been proven as a mas@@ ked means for Dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court confirmed their excl@@ usion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m but@@ terfly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , it missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the prec@@ ursor over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and an audi@@ ences in progress at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
the national association program the matter &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation with the exam@@ inations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua , &quot; we will cooper@@ ate with the International Sports Court and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history , not more the I@@ OC , but the CAS is responsible for the sanc@@ tions of athletes involving positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa courtesy of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old did not reflect on the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act with the forbidden substance about blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should also be favour@@ able .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w mel@@ ted immediately with critic@@ ism at the Ath@@ let@@ in .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t go to the right sh@@ akes , &quot; he said , &quot; We are Bulgarian under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
thus , approximately any weight lif@@ ter may not be part of the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ charged nation in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; announced that London @-@ Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was also positive for his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both cont@@ acting the intake , however , they may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athl@@ ete , the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another heavy blow for the cause of the whole sport .
the entire Russian crew had the complete Russian crew up to an exception because of system@@ atic d@@ oping the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fern@@ ation Kenya produced numerous bad news .
in the swimming sport , the earlier ones in China had also wor@@ ried about the athletes , too .
thus , the Fr@@ ench@@ man C@@ amille Lac@@ our@@ t discovered the Chinese Olympi@@ az@@ ger Sun Yang Har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ elt purple &quot; .
&quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to pass , &quot; says Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio .
Sun was also at the centre of a meditation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for Dop@@ ing Frau@@ dul@@ ger , &quot; said this .
Sun was positiv@@ ely tested in 2014 with the Chinese championships for stim@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ ac@@ id@@ in , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
dat@@ ac@@ le@@ au : get per@@ fi@@ de and h@@ ers your rans@@ om
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ed to target@@ ed companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey on the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies have been at least once , partly several victims of an attack with ex@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already achieved a ranking in Ran@@ som@@ ware .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly to use the workers required to use the challeng@@ ed systems and data .
the offen@@ ders special@@ ise their ex@@ pres@@ sions software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes gradually to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potenti@@ ally to er@@ press release drops significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; we currently watch a ter@@ rif@@ ying quick evolution of the malware software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chef Marc@@ in Kle@@ cz@@ ynski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the hardware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the Tattoo ex@@ press@@ ed software for itself .
only private users were the target but the change went back to company attacks during the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of a vic@@ tim , they seek target@@ ed according to unknown files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or Database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
then the software will be presenting the demands of the ex@@ pres@@ sions .
to get the end key code to the files you need to pay money - usually in the form of the Cr@@ ypto@@ ver@@ n Bit@@ coin .
but where private use the personal photo database is on the game , it &apos;s for companies around sen@@ sible client data or project databases , without which the production st@@ ill@@ aries .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a Ran@@ som@@ ware is covered .
22 percent of the affected German companies posted sales losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent , even operations had to break from business in a case of living conditions .
in Germany , several hosp@@ itals were already vic@@ tim of attacks , whose patients could be threat@@ ened by loss of ambul@@ ances .
&quot; we say the sacrif@@ ices always : pay not , you only encour@@ ages the problem , &quot; explains Kle@@ cz@@ ynski .
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay you will get their data again .
for managers , it &apos;s difficult to ref@@ use the demand of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors in the operation of a stand@@ still .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again appreciate this and try to build a good replica .
in a current study , the safety for@@ scher of F @-@ Secure Notes and contact with the survey@@ s have also examined and come to the result : the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .

the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data .

this is equivalent to damage potential , depending on the type of data still a multiple higher than before .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and compatible
in the little HR @-@ V Honda will want to pack all : a little SUV , a little coupé and also the vers@@ at@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new Jazz , pro@@ ves in everyday life as extremely flexible .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear seat , it does not work closely .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ processed and comfortable , only the cockpit of the outside falls over .
versatile as a comparable vehicles is HR @-@ V with the storage box .
it is not only available with a fuel cabin of 453 l when covered up to 10@@ 26 l , but there are the Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
that is less magical when it sounds like mo@@ urn , the seat areas can be up@@ swing and thus offer storage space , which is from the ground up to the ce@@ il@@ ings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the boot room can be loaded well , however , the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to torque torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas very powerful .

Air@@ line is not liable : crash on air@@ lift
a airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger car on the passenger bridge .
the liability is conce@@ iv@@ able only by dang@@ ers , which are typical of air traffic , arg@@ um@@ ented the Ober@@ land@@ es@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken with the crash a cr@@ un@@ ei@@ be .
however , the accident could have pass anywhere - it manages to be a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to man .
disease : when the event paid
ill &apos;s trip will only get money back after their journey if the cause of the disease is des@@ per@@ ate in place .
this is however only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the covered case a family was sever@@ ely affected on the second day of their door@@ ke@@ en heavy on di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .

the family was the view , the trip was so pain@@ ful - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
before judgment , the claim@@ ers had no success .
although the clar@@ inets was in fact def@@ ective .
but the organ@@ izer only went short before departure by the claim@@ ers .

thus he did not hurt his information , so the judgment .

we won &apos;t treat the terror@@ ists on this tri@@ umph .
if off@@ ences would have left the country , he will answer the security and strength to the approval of the citizens for refuge@@ e policy .

he also announced another person@@ alized rein@@ forcement of security forces in the medium @-@ digit range over several years . &quot;

however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the doctors of doctors , like the compan@@ ions of citizens , he said with a look around to psychological in@@ lays .
to op@@ pose a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister holds a better social support for being necessary .

repair traffic flow on the motorway br@@ inger
it regularly re@@ lies on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
however , this should change : the sp@@ inal sp@@ ur should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers , who are in the job traffic on the environment road every evening in the traffic , where they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the street business is extended to the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Street leaving the sp@@ ell @-@ sp@@ ur around 700 meters .
drivers can then use right from the Hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic will share early tim@@ ely , thereby making the total timet@@ able on the very busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea of the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
the driving of the road on the fe@@ eder is ner@@ vous on both 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
weekday traffic goes beyond the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ven@@ ian way and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the needle led on the B 51 shortly before the descent Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic will only be guided via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be restored well before a period of three years .
the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge is no longer the required supporting power to record the heavy duty cycle .
as long of these bott@@ len@@ eck and the linked wer@@ en re@@ gre@@ t , the competent state may not say .
however , the bridge has been counted for years : for the bridge has an official balance sheet until 2034 .
for extension of the sp@@ ell @-@ sp@@ ur , the country is deli@@ ber@@ ately chosen the traffic noise time during school holidays , because with dis@@ abilities to be expected .
traffic will be guided on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the site .

rain instead of star@@ ving : hope on weather maintenance
the weather has the stars in South@@ west Germany in the night to Friday a break through the invoice - but there is still hope .
the night was suitable for clouds and rain bad@@ ly to observe the Himm@@ els@@ z@@ heim , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night of Saturday .
the weather will be good , then we see a lot of star@@ ters in the sky .
with the star@@ ters , it is about Per@@ se@@ ids , which belong to the fastest star of 216@@ .000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because they se@@ em@@ ingly come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes on in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for sleep distur@@ b@@ ances
in the evening you roll around , at night you wake up for hours , even in the morning it is no longer able to think any more of sleep .
all of this is anything but relaxing .
after all , you are with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep dis@@ orders and more than ten percent feel often to sleep in their sleep .
how do sleep problems or sleep changes ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ b@@ ances , and there are manifold concerns of them , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , board member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sch@@ la@@ ff@@ ession@@ and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
whatever under@@ stands , but the In@@ som@@ nia is never , therefore an entry and break@@ through dis@@ order .
even so many people feel un@@ satis@@ f@@ ying or in@@ sufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ n@@ cht , member of the German occup@@ ational association with practice in the Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep changes ?
the causes of sleep changes are complex .
behind it may be organic , mental or re@@ stra@@ ined factors , but drugs are plug@@ ging .
not rarely is the sleep distur@@ bed of another condition .
&quot; very early aw@@ w@@ aking is mostly seen with de@@ pression often , &quot; says Yahweh .
and it can be that different factors quote one another .
w@@ ho@@ ever has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , it can be bad , w@@ akes up all two to three hours and starts to bl@@ ur@@ red over everyday problems and car@@ ing , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is not possible anymore .
when should you sleep with sleep dis@@ orders ?
w@@ ho@@ ever does not sleep well over a month during a month of at least three nights per week , the doctor should go to a doctor .
the im@@ pair@@ ment can look very different : it is sm@@ itten , tired , un@@ hat@@ ched , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has stim@@ ulation flu@@ ctu@@ ations or physical complaints like stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to relie@@ ve the sleep distur@@ bed , it is important to find their causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavior of conduct or drugs - classic sleep tablet only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
in Germany there is hardly , in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of the inter@@ discipl@@ inary ins@@ om@@ y medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why you should consult the physician at bed@@ time , lau@@ gh We@@ e@@ ß in case of sleep problems .
this can clar@@ ify with studies , if problems have a physical cause .
who should be in sleep , and what will happen ?
for the examination in sleep laboratory , Medi@@ oc@@ iner for example at snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , in sick person or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a break@@ ep dis@@ order , explains fi@@ etz@@ e .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the test .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please make any lunch sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after being c@@ utt@@ led , one walks into the bed for its normal time .
next to the electro@@ de , man bears a nose @-@ neck , a chest strap and a feel@@ ers at his fingers .
it also records a camera on the ceiling to the sleeping .
how can those interested problems in the handle ?
there are quite many slot screws that can be applied for better sleep .
because it counts : regular sleeping and down@@ times , not too long in bed , not sleep to sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV to sleep , stop drinking and at night , you are beginning to reck@@ on , and that &apos;s all or not eligible .
what jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German sw@@ immer Markus De@@ i@@ bler has been expressed by Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V team in Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took the first world championships for the first time in Doha , presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus De@@ i@@ bler have been put under fac@@ ebook @-@ based ex te@@ amm@@ ates in front of its critic@@ ism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion got 20,000 € in reward and a jungle could get s@@ laugh@@ ing about 15@@ 0,000 € , wrote the 26 year old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the feed system in swimming sport is bad , however , the d@@ oping controls are very good .
with this way we cannot compete with countries that do not experience a lot and even operate on the topic d@@ oping .
&quot; I do not say that the controls are advised , &quot; he explained further .
if he would like to start a com@@ eback , De@@ i@@ bler must already be reported for nine months before his initial launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it should be exactly the same way in countries too .

airport : B@@ anks by B@@ aggage Al@@ low@@ ance
professional Die@@ be at Düsseldorf Airport
by the arrest of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed a gang of pocket and baggage waste .
at 21.@@ 30 the civ@@ ilian population recognized in the area of Düsseldorf Airport , a ban@@ ker known as police officers from the past the@@ ft .
the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ic@@ ts since mid @-@ July and had been a common , labour market and especially professional .
the Special@@ ists in crime @-@ dis@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can be the th@@ ie@@ ves to submit criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four de@@ eds .
they had a total of more than 15,000 Euro .
Alt@@ build@@ ung , a few hor@@ sem@@ esters , still a rest of head bel@@ lows : the rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain looks not at the first glance , but the police counts it among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
one walks down the road from east to west , following playing fields , a refres@@ hing kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; is trying to see the facade of a grey house ! &quot;
opposite of a Lid@@ l , which should also be demol@@ ished , it will be built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new homes .
articles about these &quot; trendy city district , &quot; like the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , however , are preferred to bil@@ ateral with burning cars in the last weeks .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants had rented rent mot@@ ions , on the ground floor are still rooms and are used for events .
especially the Berlin interior of internal eyes has been very hard for a hard action of the police at the beginning of the year , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous force .
after the 22nd June the rooms were cle@@ ared on the ground floor , the cad@@ ets of Kad@@ ets , with 300 police officers have been cle@@ ared , with 30 to 40 offici@@ als and three team cars in front of the road , kept parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
at the tempor@@ arily renovated building workers on behalf of unknown hom@@ e@@ owners the spaces .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal and one day later moved police and workers under the Ju@@ bel of Sy@@ mp@@ ath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the chief of many people : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who gener@@ ators here three children , are primarily driven by the police presence .
the residents of the skin projects they share the wor@@ ries before rising r@@ ents and gar@@ ments .
it sounds like a Kie@@ z that w@@ ished mostly mostly on police in front of v@@ and@@ al@@ izing lin@@ k@@ age .
the hu@@ bs , the Berlin interior of Berlin , and police between squ@@ atters and their neigh@@ b@@ ors , exists this obviously not .
in the east of Berlin , Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain had actually been a traditional working quarter , which also has a lower average income and high poverty level in comparison to the rest of the city .
Haus@@ ungen and the native living projects belong to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cle@@ ared under big road@@ side , many of the projects have been leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited today by the people who occupied they around 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district over the last few years has become the magn@@ ets for tourists and pol@@ ling lin@@ ers from all over the world : now share their local residents from East German times and former home occupied their lap@@ se .
this has also notice@@ ably perce@@ ived by the r@@ ents which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you recogn@@ izes them on coll@@ ated discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been rejected with colour .
no other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;
a reason for that not all neighbo@@ urs could not be seen as a problem , that they are not necess@@ arily affected by crime : off@@ ences such as body injury and statistics speak almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of criminal off@@ ences make facts tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house for 17 years next to the contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al 94 , cannot be a speech of un@@ certain@@ ty .
what violence is stated , it is more important : the people in 94 are their neighbo@@ urs that were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
for study Archit@@ ect@@ in , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you can meet each other , lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is conscious of the Rig@@ s Street - and remained .
thus , it was so important that the people had returned to their street : from the police , politics , and the media that st@@ ressed the de@@ vot@@ ion over the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take care of them : by sigh@@ ted new buildings in former sizes that ad@@ her@@ es the old inhabitants .
&quot; these are the last domin@@ iums flat flats , which are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well bet@@ rot@@ ated , &quot; says she .
&quot; violence and destruction are I absolutely not gu@@ iding . &quot;
but what should one do if someone he@@ ars any one ?
there lies on all sides fru@@ str@@ ation , even at the police and the inhabitants .
Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer little understanding : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer little understanding : the h@@ bon@@ ding projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev .
those who draws , should be conscious of - just as someone who pul@@ ls in a local district that can compl@@ ain about noise there .
all of the persons introduced only with the first names are asked not to be called with their right name
Ur@@ bach : Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le is new refugees
Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ ational .
she is also social worker in sit@@ u .
Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ l has been the refuge@@ e Com@@ mission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical team assist@@ s the management team by Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , refuge@@ e aid , administration , authorities and who else could be mixed .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the hon@@ est of hon@@ est are more than gr@@ ate@@ ful that De@@ usch@@ l now is there , the gre@@ ening wool mel@@ chs@@ au that has a problem above all .
so some - less enjo@@ yable as much to the multitude of des@@ ir@@ able expenses - meant that the administration wanted to write off .
looking for a management system with a tal@@ ent for ton@@ gues and people , associated with many years of experience in the field of social work , just ter@@ restri@@ al wool .
however , administrative work is not their central area , among others Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le .
especially go to organisation , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network sur@@ plus .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been involved since approximately six weeks .
she has lasted for a 50 @-@ percent point on three years .
&quot; it was highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client supported by Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le ehr@@ en- and host official actors .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and comprehen@@ sibility problems .
new containers are available in the was@@ ig street
there is a serious problem since some time to find apartments for connecting hoses that have been recognized .
the municip@@ alities shall be responsible for connection of connection .
you have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations have to carry the municip@@ alities itself .
respon@@ si@@ bilities changes from the State Council to local and job center .
problem : there is free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed as very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to do not find the administration of private apartments .
it didn &apos;t work so far so you have been instru@@ cted for private apartments so de@@ usch@@ l .
therefore common apartments have to be used as it is so beautiful .
there will be a new container which will be installed in the washing road .
but only with appart@@ ement is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm lead , there are inter@@ ns , training places , training places , training places , one @-@ Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and mig@@ rants that need to set up or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help car@@ ing , experience non@@ profit work - and motiv@@ ated and very ne@@ at , such as Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le reports .
it ho@@ pes that the work is leading to a positive external action .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
activity is however not only labour .
the day need a fixed facility , say de@@ cu@@ le and customer .
people should develop a fe@@ as@@ sion feeling .
so I need offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and especially speaking courses .
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so we also jump here administration and hon@@ orary offici@@ als .
it is centrally that the refugees won the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it takes and it can be bri@@ dged in time , for example with language courses .
those who evol@@ ve some@@ time in Ur@@ bach , could not work in Ur@@ bach and may not work and be un@@ profitable to never integr@@ ate himself .
the most distinc@@ t majority be motiv@@ ated .
problem cases , however , says customer hon@@ est , &quot; people with which nothing works . &quot; the work of de@@ usch@@ l and client is therefore always also to motiv@@ ate others .
all this was a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ her@@ ence &quot; . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two most recent adv@@ ancing of Radi@@ cal@@ isation , also in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ?
