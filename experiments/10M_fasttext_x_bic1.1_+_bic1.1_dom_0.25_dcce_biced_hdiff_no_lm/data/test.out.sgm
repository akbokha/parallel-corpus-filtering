<seg id="1">Clintons and slump's economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - they want to get both Clinton and trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the two US presidential seekers are subject to the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is one fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small, warns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton turns to death and regulate the economy and says to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be completely different to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will be able to massively back regulating, and it is strong for a wide control arises with lower tax sets strong - for private persons and companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's commitment says: the state has to fulfill specific tasks, it has notified opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore the tax would be increased for the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the mills we will invest, Trump and Clinton are almost literally.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic and democratic policy and are rejected by the state-critical Teaparty-wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, we could get in-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Distinct are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump will build coal plants and drive coal equipment in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas that I want to cancel the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast to an investment programme, Clinton will explicitly aim to build the renewable energies and create: "a country will create the power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even for international trade agreement the two opponents are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifical trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the U.S. would not want to isolate from international trade - but simply by American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid even better for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of USD 7.25 is a hungry wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What is what is to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage is rinsing, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the upcoming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to splash growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, thus the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, at least one of the kingdoms, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost already for everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sitting four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is at the most one year old.</seg>

<seg id="13">To work with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the area manager of Condrobs, one carrier for social helpers in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are escaped.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Munich north you live in one of the few decentralised women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made up the facility with Pro Familia and Munich Women's Remedy.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically prosecuted for them or death, because their families are threatened to send them as a hope of hope to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">In females weigh other reasons for the escape: "many steal themselves because they don't see any other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, kennel, honorary morals, slavery or compulsory institutions.</seg>
<seg id="26">This moves her.</seg>
<seg id="27">The way goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that, for example, demand for a bottle of water such sexual act is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end as soon as she arrived in Germany, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here, all women in refugees would often be considered as inferior to inferior and worse ones.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to about 90 percent of women who dwell in the residence in the Munich's north, traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were used so that they don't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they dare not dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they are often not going to help, then I need more accommodation only for them, called Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district rankings are responsible for the establishment of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question if they are using a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction of life, answers some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there is no such a thing in the governments of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in the Swabians alone, women are not inhabited separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press ram of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Mittelfranken are available in some joint size floors or own homes for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of women and gender equality has also been urged in the European Parliament that women must be divided separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study which was published for the Committee, it says: "it is very important that men and women are separate."</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or become affected by men and women, there may be - ongoing - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Specially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">As if the women feel like this, you can read the ingestion that there are on the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"have been around since it has been talking about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of external suppliers"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to declare his hands and proclaimed an official end of the aged eight months and proclaimed the wars of economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin withdrew his Turkish counterpart in the gilded room of St. Petersburg Palastes, I can't miss that Ankara's reconciliation will fail.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin smiles really smiled and it was hardly heat, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan said to be repeated by his "dear Friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also spoke that relations with Russia could not only be able to return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day actually described a newspaper that Erdogan would have thought more than would never happen something worst.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed to me rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that the Russian state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather the cause of the crisis was the first to mention in its introduction: the deposition of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin returned and accused Ankara to his back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The deal was even bigger, as it was committed by a confident friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The pack's pack is difficult to build, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the nationally controlled media guided a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed to bear the Turks for everything that bear blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious complications of guiding poinsmen that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syrians from the so-called Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has questioned this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting just took place because Putin got the excuse of President Erdogan who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could reserve a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice are clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily interested in all friends who can get in after last month's coup d'etat almost his amending.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights, each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish Coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia tour operators and other regional companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are on a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the national television sentiest fruits and vegetables predicts once the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes, long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is mad at the West since its reaction to the tried to look for a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To do this, the ongoing groves of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which makes it out, out of the cool tuning benefits and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian President of Russian won a bonus in Ankara with security that he called for the elected coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a self-intelligible for Moscow, which itself has a deep frightening of fear.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace in this glittering palace made it in Russia and Turkey, one as it gave me an analyst once described, "Alliance of Foreign Characters": two countries based on the west and feel bad and now ignite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still considerable differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow gave up the role as a peacemakers, but Russia and Turkey supporting each other.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be strikingly, that after almost three hours first, both President had pronounced the press conference at the press conference that they could not even say this subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey abandoned it to answer a question about their differences, and Putin decided to bets this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about that, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of hostilities - and in view of the Potenzias for a perfect disaster, when NATO member is Russian fighting jet, it is certainly better that the two heads will speak at least again.</seg>

<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">All RSB references, headquartered in England and Wales, will change its headquarters and stock traits at NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for private customers, which are more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN has been interviewed during a guided tour of customers and staff in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland by: "the RSB brand will be on our investment brand as well as to the brand, among which our employees work, since we are now going to become a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the Bank itself became a global brand, RBS was become a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now I say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among those brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS already told that it will not continue to continue his Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptibility of various brands in its sport sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop the bank of brands, as we focus on in the inside (we asked ourselves) to make it a better bank for customers?" said the board of the board.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical before three years, when we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched this brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can swing these brands again, so I think that the time is come.</seg>

<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he made his conclusion to the renowned National Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is (in Russian) that he later became a Head of Head of the Head Office and Head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin on his appointment, "Thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of government to support your activity as the State of State for Legislanders and controls.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday, that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino as his successor is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the faces of the faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious wounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time in Vladimir Putin's largest confidentiality and works as he worked for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">On a meeting with President Putin that was broadcasted on TV, both men continued to withdraw his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the breakdown for cameras, few of them are convinced - mainly, just before parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So what's the result of a kind of struggle for?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once was prived to forward as a potential president, on once the Russian environmental policy was to lead to great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov "it's true that I asked you in a conversation, I would almost say this very complicated Posten - one could almost say - complained for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it was out, I have been the President of the Russian Presidential Council for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov participated in the post office in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin has a member of the KGB state military service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, Putin was chairman of the Bundessivical officer (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin met the power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once Ivanov was once accepted to Putin's second term of office, since there could have a third term in Putin against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, seamless ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North-deck of Queensferry Crossings with the Viaduct - what means that the bridge is now connected to maturity.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closing of the "ceiling fan," the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge piece from maturity is now 600 meters long and weighs just 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slavings.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economy Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the site today and was one of the first who walked the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an iconic art of an truly epic measurement in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lift between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridging can be found at their place and the last stretch of decks today in Rosyth gets a hole for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted by the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">The closure of trendsetting high and deep construction represents this fantastic project.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last street cover and its connection with the present north tower deck, we had to close the still existing gap in the northern or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached via pulling the northern feeder bridge of 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to reach up to a slope of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heikel, as the tolerances, which the team work, were tiny - on every side they were just a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Braunschweigs favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Grüne mean: investors still should be taken too much stronger in the duty.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 affordable housing in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "storation concept" for the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But battle is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first line goes around the question: who should build the affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="7">A provision is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD parliamentary party, Christoph gravmann says: "we're with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas is to show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments."</seg>
<seg id="9">The affordable housing can however also be developed in its holdings.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Hall of the Town Hall was, however, as a bratman: "how are you going to build investors in private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to build investors on such surfaces at least 10 percent, but as soon as 20 percent of dwellings as social dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new Municipal residential building programme, which will cost millions, will be funded, and will provide for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so frying: "there is no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as a few rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left plans for investors still for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of that, so, the story of the situation based on the housing market is disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="17">The action concept will be implemented, which will provide additional tasks in the building management process.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear if we will get the staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the programme is not entirely different: because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does the loss of more about 1300 affordable housing results, whose funding will be expecting over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planetary spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, this would have to be thought about to recover shipments again.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West city.</seg>
<seg id="26">To one stroke the problem can be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West city walk to the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the cost of affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners who do not use housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social dwellings in the West city is drastically increased, one can be removed from the target of the so-called interference.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social weak in only a few cities should not give it any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group president Holger Herlitschke says: "for a broad majority, the CDU must be with the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This is focused on more construction sites for family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that yet a compromise can be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting after health and happiness, worth it worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is amazingly to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child can't go out anymore but rather you prefer to spend their free time, on monitors to rigid, was suing in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it is about to get people from the sofa and allow to be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was at the beginning on TV, then limited to video games and at least on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and activities are not facing each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I clicked on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s (later it developed a string series, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture came to the interest of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go again had more users than tiny and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In brief, the players go outside with their smartphones to search outside and search for Pokémons that have been tracked with a GPS as soon as they were found, "photographed" (on a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when she was still younger, decided to get the tap and sprang the couch for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person rest each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35.000 users passed by the Washington Post shortly before launching the number of people followed by 45 percent every day, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - only the raw data for power upgrade.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public explanations for health, people want to bring "" "" "" "" by the sofa "and" "every day actively engaging in his ears, because many public messages are boring in the health and they come from people coming to the end.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sports may not be reviewed yet.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who are regularly sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Therefore, three pillars of health coverings - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is also mürric play derives that must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could follow earlier our activity, they gave us no reason to exaggerate how to do this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">New will lose its appeal and the use is refilled with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activity will be divided into the real world and help many people to be chase, active, fitter, and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="11">Its total score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medailliterer and "final Five" -Mannpascameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze man medallier in Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, the women of the Olympic Games in the art of art at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American leader, winning a combined event, and a altogether the fifth, while they had their reputation to be the best of its generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She collapsed in tears when their final score was showed, and her long journey was found at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought up their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals so that they contain a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou feminon said that she was "the best gymnast which I ever saw."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to take an last trial in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of athletes, but rather than oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not to return with a handful of gold back to family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace her in gold and silver in the individual combined event of women in the art of art at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, and won</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday during the farewell celebration that was retired in retirement in Martha Karolyi as a foreword.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles were on it, during their long road to the top, never the future is planned, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">A part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music, which would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child, adopted by coacherin Aimee Boormans mother during a school trip during the gym, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since summer 2013, it has no longer lost all combined events, a sieve, which becomes so long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina has easily carried out through two filings, tracked the image.</seg>
<seg id="27">The chestnut and the Bodins - in which Biles holds the world champion title.</seg>
<seg id="28">She returns again with 15,433 on the pig and sat down on the ground with 15.933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her endage - and tears in Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision that once was described in her scoring book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The power of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a downturn to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old man captains had called "Oma" of Americans, a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their floorstanding, they cast their audience by their comeback, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared without doubt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need to use Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I propose to myself in the Turns at the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First I started with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three turers, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie, Hernandez, inspire for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish and Madison Kocian, the Katholikin is very proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has noted the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport art.</seg>
<seg id="8">During the last four years the number one was one of the female family of Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabon were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is showing strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising conflict in America and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be the unbelievable achievement of the triple world championship by Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, yet mastered Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth heterosexual American leader, who won gold in an individual combined event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but not see tournament classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie succeeded in creating the same way as Aly and Madison to create it at the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the last five, because the next Olympic troops were only four turers in the crew. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is an expensive sport and gymnasts a first line in private gymnasium that are upright on the training, supervision, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be solved at any time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses, gymnasts receive its overall workout and that is a expensive and long-term engagement for families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained athletes have started her athlete since she started playing.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to inspire the municipalities of Aun countless, young girls who will inspire by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more powerful and easily accessible tournament.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my tournament company for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">For my events we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for more than 15.000 people (mainly black and Hispanic) and trains national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth of high quality models to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and popularity for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life benefits for health and education and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, the thousands of young girls to be interested in Turns and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true account of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic Team and thank you for playing so many young girls with a different background to begin to begin healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller signed the immune system and dignalex of a serious testing - taking some of the most dirty and informative places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travelling model Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk will hold its course on a Euro-Schein, a gelding button of a train shower as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving each object he used a luminaire to show himself and let us know what he is going to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment done under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner STRENGTH," brought some unexpected results of the daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, to refuse the rinse button of a train shower, which has already been used by thousands of others, but really are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts on the promotion of Darmbakteries as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing left, what he fitted, more than a bad taste in mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by the world traveled and such as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to flush pull down toilets, the task assigned his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film, he said: "already as a child, I was relatively undried about what my health concerns and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to meet his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he was off, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its downscale showed a luminaires of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometric Luminaire number of freshly seasoned hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after their luminosity equals about 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a score of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producers of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker" s Guide to Inner STRENGTH, "which shows the bacterial numbers of different locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">He says, "This is the worst thing which I have dressed in a toilet, close to."</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirt than this!</seg>
<seg id="20">I am sorry for nothing because it is under ekelist here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner STRENGTH" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company feature Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of bowel movements and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to really offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating, and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brain Storming through which we finished that we said "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and the documentary we were able to provide consumers for more information in an interesting manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who introduced me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, when he had tasted my respect for Ian, when he did some of the things that I have instructed him, such as the ekelty Russian toilet which will be shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there was things to do with which it was easier to bring Ian to her, and others, with which this was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of this dirty leakies. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by 2015, 84 per cent of all surveyed surveys conducted in 2015 in particular with the prosperity of mages and intestines and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products, the added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Shakespeare-Year presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With it a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, "Leornard Bernsteins masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director of Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth space.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan Conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he was warmed.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that she is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix that is the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really enjoyed the music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production of Bartoli, Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She reminded of Wehmut to her lover with Tony, while the younger Mary is playing and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly because it's extremely extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be a personality to Mary.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So she is wise, of course also naive, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I resembles me very, my Italian character that I have as a rocket," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>

<seg id="22">And Bartoli will return the compliment: "Dudamel is an exceptional artist and passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a need for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in every of his movements, in his click, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyous approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly current: "in this piece it is about prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we decided to have refugees at that time, the pupils who had gone to New York and would not have wanted to go to New York.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful as at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vacationists from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood them.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the farmer will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Smilking parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For that is not until now, it is not: summer holidays, heat and mountain meal - it has retained.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals are to be convinced by the polling shoppers, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists who are in the country are on Usedom, Ruegen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, practical problems: in the holidays are helpers that kindles up posters, balloons and flyers, flyers, and at the end of the vote, only effort to apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September 2016, the election and last stop day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to go over the people just over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase if one can tell at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his post.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998, has been the strongest party, now clearly behind CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Excitingly, how strongly Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of Koalitionous remains.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 directing government, makes an almost unremarkable campaigns, one sees itself from his grandposters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the land, distributed roses and plauches a little with the people, as it did his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, soul has been getting cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, "We do this" have accelerated the ascension of spopudes, which will probably cost him the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its nickname dates, the Minister of the Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, when you make the wrong time at the right place battle.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has been invited to German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Merkel is on the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," defendant Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But there was no one to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany, Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU is largely driven on market places and shopping areas with umbrellas and air balloon.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, so will Kokert, plays only a "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that in the land weakened the base that they need to feel very close to invent one wire for people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens, hardly exists in the territory of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU electoral campaign, however, is also self-grabbing: "you have to go there, namely, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game has, Sellering has now called its SPD to an especially committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls the S & Ds last with 22 percent behind CDU (25) and just ahead of AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At election 2011, the SPD had still won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, tiny party with seven percent in polls could be the leap into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from the holiday in need and selling their campaigns largely in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online electoral campaign," it's the president of Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green dial converters on track search for local stimulants under the vacationers.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speediness the B 27 is repaired, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the responsibilities of the construction work, starting at 5.30 in the morning, and only at about 20 clock, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"those have done everything quite tidy," says Elvira Tetzlaff music from the Jet gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">Construction site was scheduled to be moved sometime at the beginning of October, until the end of October, everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">This will also be the entities of responsibility for the construction works, about when it comes to set aside.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the site was carried out on Monday to the south, and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been abolished and the connection to Rottenburg has also been relaxed, has relaxed the traffic situation within the place.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens now can go on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evitable traffic through the place seems to come back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there was partially substantial complaints," says the chief chief of the former director Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The local residents of brook, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichways tried and rather trusted in their Navi as the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to that some truck was frank in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since even the speed limiting is not maintained, the community activates the measuring vehicle from malignore.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was considerable surviving," says King that himself pointed out on the location about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are already two to three per minute have been etched.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way to reach the speed of 77 km in the pace-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the building has been moved, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people in the B 27, it is only a small Trost that is now open for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the cards, business people don't have to look like.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, that the B 27 restoration among them has led to sales brood, each one who asks you are looking through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However some more and some are affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who has less to do with the "end customers" so for other firms, for which the renovation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz says of a "most slight decline," but also there is a fact that of course "Disclaimer is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily prevaled road places along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert GÖHNER, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly known as crown.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existing threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only for him, but all the restaurants were "hard hit."</seg>
<seg id="30">It lacked the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about each Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">It has risen to "far more than 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">The road junction has been put back by two years. "</seg>
<seg id="34">He must have dismissed the half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have changed different.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt on request of GÖHNER, if there would be a financial compensation which would benefit from the share of the location at the B 27. now they also have the drawbacks which arise through the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other landcircles, where a little generously handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">For all suits, GÖHNER is sure that its participation will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been based here since 1715, refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less often preventing due to the complex transport leadership.</seg>
<seg id="41">You can't drive around, it is also pretty beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">After the end of the reconstruction works again, GÖHNER has no doubt about that.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu GÖHNER keeps the effects of the B 27-construction works on his customer for the biggest crisis that has experienced its own history in its longstanding history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, which is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The terrorist fighting is constantly screwed on the name of the terrorist fighting.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent attacks, the Minister of Interior de Maizière now lays a new safety package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what does a Duldungsstatus have to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the Koalitioners say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals were "politically generally" politically, "says the Federal Minister of Security at the performance of his new security packages.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are superior to anybody.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also participate in it too.</seg>
<seg id="10">But as the Minister of Interior, he is located on the results and a consensus consensus within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg, Ansbach did not leave a little time before he presented his conclusion for security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the fall now fall around.</seg>
<seg id="13">One has already announced, announced that a new security authority must take care of the cracking of encrypted communications, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also not the fact that Germany has to translate multiple EU specifications to airplane and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video monitoring and staff for safety authorities as well as no surprise.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière takes a second attempt on suggestions to do with the SPD so far: he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German Pass.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the more difficult points will be for the SPD," dream of the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He still keep doing this for mostly and necessity, which has no odds at the coalitioners.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presented by de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">Partly it is partly in: it plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted to the country will allow their smart phones to check their smart phones and reveal social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">He wants to kill some asylum seekers for abovated asylum seekers as to date - approximately such that offences carry out or reconsciously take away their identity in order to deny their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legally heicel.</seg>
<seg id="24">Deficient is still unbalanced and easy to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - at inequality of ideas, for example - is the question: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, Maizière says it's important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to address the assassinter of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people did worry about safety in view of the high refugee camps.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that had profoundly employed people, did not break out even in campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">The stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The unsafeguarding is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election struggles.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD focus on inner security therefore increasingly in position.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past days there went up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garret dispute over the appointments of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some imions of the Minister, also demand a Burka-ban and a return from doubling citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière takes care here to sual tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a return from the double pass, he is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfying the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">They reapse, be not meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in a Burka-prohibition, he is constitutional objections.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners as it is actually "generally," for the coalitioners, it must still be shown.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in what could do for dispute.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to profiled an internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Parteichef Sigmar Gabriel signed first time to talk and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contribute to the security."</seg>

<seg id="11">Even if the heart is charming slowly at his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent salesman were resident, there are still a handful of fantastic flat business stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would like to ask the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to observe the age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, I found out of Sister Ray (Data: two young women, three men mean age) to Reckless Records (Data: eight men's middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops in order to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, ask me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate it," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This record, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by him), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not buy and sell objects when it was sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I bought will come from the late 60s, early 70s, appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably too young to buy them," says he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates, are rather introverted, and add to your own time, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my Lace.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray believes that many customers believe he meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who will have influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have to be seen again their old plates.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks I kept, people usually have taken care of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who have once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that cover stores a soothing community of equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers came to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed up from the digital world and would like to retreat stability of confused noise cover, backgrounds, which stimulate tactic.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material property as one type of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">It is with me as a collector, and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" we flew a staff of a flatstack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of those who purchased a record last month, they have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found that 41% have a record player who will never use it while 7% of those who have a record, not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of message, I would probably look very concerned while I blame through a stack of Bossa Nova compliations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, used in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men intermediate age) has worked, has a "tropher aspect" of the Revial.</seg>
<seg id="39">"somebody first came here soon and said," I have no record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive heavy, less musiced.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say, "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who are only slowly becoming cleaned.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an entertaining audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women's middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts of latest synthesis - and sexually-packed pop instead of experimental Jazz goes from the speakers - it's good to see such a diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them can look strange, but brand new psychic traumata are difficult to fix when you stand next to somebody for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and consider the variety of products for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a mannequin than a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">They deserves much, therefore it is not an actual option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other way, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a lovely roufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, of which is said to have inspired a new generation of panel fans. urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the note that I observe the jeans Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage cameras, which for a moment to grouping out polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter persuade to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left you find a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her to - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to capture it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "modern art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of it that every attraction involve more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, also that is the most suitable for luxury objects such as sheets.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research results showed that the results can be judged by YouGov, they are at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and plates that exist in reality, record shops and in online.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not to do with bummeln through the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they staring a guard of an unheimen, 30-year-old moderator meiden who chill from the shoulders lacking men's middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-s Rugby came in the final on Thursday night to hold a hold in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were struck with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro stages here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji had a masterclass in handling, Side-Stepping, post-back, line and roher force to win gold - their first Olympic medals of all colours.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the non-existent Prize of silver medal - Great Britain's fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The substantial defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals of the same day could fall back in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in this form, Fiji had defeated a 15-man team in his shape.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it's probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Cheb trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult journey behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They lost only one here.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will weep, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks of GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in the buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau went up in the corner as Osea Kolinisau.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jerry Tuwai added another attack on the right corner with another four minutes running time.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB installed almost the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A high-outstanding Tackle of Mitchell stopped the Berg by Mann vs. Nakarawa, but Fiji had only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua reached a touchdown and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-ship and there was still about a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prefished by further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormy to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so when Fiji had been born to play the 7 playing, while the GB still is still awning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half time by and joined the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was running long in favour of the Southeast sulphites, whose fans sank, flags bends and dance on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame replaced the i-Tüpfelchen with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle emitted, the Fijis embraced himself and knocked his GB crumbly in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Previously, Fiji had defeated Japan in semifinals with 20-5, and Britain placed South Africa in a squad half final match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">An brilliant Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside teams, secured profits - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the trainer of the coach for rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold than with these games and what would be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard heieve that was in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were in the boat, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all in the second Olympic champion in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, which put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, at all the 39.95 insole use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we are looking are two brillies Athletes, gliding over the surface with the elegance of goers, which is not reflected in the kind of triumphs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion on willing helpers to contribute to the incremental progress, which would not know the difference before the trainer, who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and that did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, he is spreading everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite worse situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little further views.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was fortunate that he could be the treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, what the break was at a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the right concept.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it had to go better again.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would answer.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the invisibility of victory there were their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a nervous drier in this morning and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, which was in use as a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional disrack. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated only how much I means, how much I and Helen and others did work.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no man, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could have no better person for trainers or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning do not have a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a tough rhythm, with whom their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to connect, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "bleib in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important to let not take away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make some Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we wanted to get out a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear on a wedding next week, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backbone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she simply wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That could have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so disturbed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels much better on, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has escorted her entire life: as a young girl she took part in the school's choir, the student of music, and today the 78-year-old sing together in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I will sing - emotional and physically," she describes it.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels happy, cheerful and a whole life, says she.</seg>
<seg id="5">Very next to it, they do good for their health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal from several perspectives, a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniors division.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing together in the choir and share the joy of the music, describes Hackers.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular cooperation, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often, social and family structures will solve in the age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>

<seg id="11">Sing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since the seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who urged his lungs regularly, does not work as fast as the purest in daily life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Market of the Seniors organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the elderly generations common singing had a lot of job, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is often observed that singing or listening songs in older people are many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, people are unaffected by even dementia people.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a particular achievement is called, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm which is to match the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even older people who live alone, practice not just focusing on yourself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition we proceeded by singing in the chorus, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-feeling of self esteem is growing by singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I say long for something I will improve and watch over me - this experience stronger.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he says, little talent to have Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who ceases, when a sound goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, seniors have different ways, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sing somebody from the awareness of a senior intelligence, you simply can join them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir can be addressed directly to the church or the church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many Seniors you can find also about the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet, can ask your family, friends or neighbours around the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whoever wants to sing, should be connected to a chorus.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul well and has something liberating - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">After several days also, the Constitutional Guards have also asked the constituent in the group.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we see at the 'Identitarian movement" Another points for aspirations against the freedom of democratic basic rules, "said Constituent Hans-Georg Maate by the German Press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, migrants are diffaminated from the Middle East in an extremist way.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thus we watch the movement as well.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "identity movement" is a group of grouping with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">She turns against "Multiculturalism", "Improved Mass Immigration" and "loss of your own identity by an override."</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutionists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Bavaria, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the "identity."</seg>
<seg id="9">Maate said he did his authority in the decision closely with the offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'identity movement" try to pick up their target group, where it stands, "said the Constitutional Court.</seg>
<seg id="11">Generally, extreme cases, they often have to speak with young language, often involving popping music.</seg>
<seg id="12">The openly Islamists as well as right-driving tremors.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a useful advertising for your own business.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda should respond emotional response.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are in a special way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the end of several federal states, there have been contacts of "identitarian" of AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maate said, I have no knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the constituent use, possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point.</seg>
<seg id="20">It comes to whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain people, the extremist, changes and extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">So, if such people are control of the party control on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view of the marked increase of legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees said, Maate, he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have established in recent years that there can be legal structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There were the group 'Old School Society' or the Friday group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that other lawful groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee shees or attacks from other legal experts.</seg>
<seg id="27">A wide-wide or European control of lawsterrism is however not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were made at regional level or social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Maate convinced that many over the people went over to the account of people who had not entered into the right scene before.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying arming.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects at asylum seekers were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or trailers of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed offences who had previously voted against nothing at the hat, who were perhaps politically indifferent or for example CDU, SPD or linke, however, radically have radically driven by far right mistakic stimulation."</seg>

<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"News, Social Information, which were seized by high-ranking CentCom Commander, typically have a positive picture of the US efforts against terrorism as an analysis of other news services," cited a newspaper article published in this report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what will happen at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, when poor analysis of our political leaders will be presented," Ken Calvert, represented a publican member of the Representative House.</seg>
<seg id="7">The managers in the CentCom will reach the top top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct references to modify, the rule pointed out under Obama, shows how analysts have exposed the pressure from their preset, an optimum image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, opinions and testimonials were clearly positive than the facts," presented the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom members, belonging to a public, announced that a military reconquering Mossulphs can start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015, the peak Command was changed by the Central Command to record the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans created the task force in the life after they were concerned that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports from the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings throughout the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Further investigation of CentCom reports are published by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense in the Gange.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic Members of the newscourteas published their own findings with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom will create a highly restricted process for building implementing revaluation in ISIL, and the Iraqi security services, and a member in the Representative House Adam B. Schiff, known in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, as Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of upsetting services," failures the morals under analysts, and 'was excessively little space for different views. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats offered, no critics to one of the White House at CentCom analysts on a "certain political opinion" have found.</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent August, the New York Times was reported by the Pentagon led by the Pentagon, following complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr Patrick Evans, a press officer of the Pentagon, in a statement, gave no reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the general spectrours will be still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also agreed that "experts sometimes had divergent opinion regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence relate a controversial discussion of this important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">Investigations have had a decisive impact on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that will be made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, during the last year, President Obama failed to leave military operations for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of secret information about the Islamic state recalls more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a correspondence in excess of George W.

<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and lusted the ball in the gate around the Americans a 2-0 guidance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games ever.</seg>

<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and spreading.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the Olympic torch himself is a burning staff, which is sufficient for athletes to cross Turner to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't stop the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Legry or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is a logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, would certainly have been under this known name, which can be sent to Prime Time by sponsors und well-feel-TV advertisement if it would be a swimmer, gymnasts or even more feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic Flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not widely recognised: airbrush shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swim, and may have dominion over there.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I wanted to make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline bed has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has happened so many that I had asked, didn't know that it is an Olympic and portart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This may also be regional Ignoranz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to competition, he has never won a medal in jumping on a trampoline and had made a athletes until 2012, which made it to final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are curious to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who want to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Bell from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping on the trampoline has an outbreak exterior, partly because it sounds inexplaned ear suitable for a clowmaster school than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a happy enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the kartoonful trembling of his never to be swollen - but also the grazie of the tournament and diving, the two sports that combines it in the essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" is written by the Spanish El trampoline, which means much means "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victor jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, hays and Saltos) before they end up at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">It will be evaluated by the official Olympics of achievement, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two hundred and thirty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are joined in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallions hopes to continue in their quest to gold, faster, go up and over, sometimes till the finish, sometimes go and back, go up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the starting point, but also in the television transmission again: the world or the Lord Lord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The target ranged is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to stirring even a spectators.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feeling on watching the games as a bit fatiguing.</seg>
<seg id="30">Therewith the trampoline offers a breathing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downwards movement is not the aim.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she calls off, seemingly heavy as a astronaut, descend up, then moved back to the above.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, not mercenaries into the distance, just dreamy, elegant uplift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen how the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women and final rounds of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympic mania they promise a calm, nice moment that will probably survive in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness can only be achieved by the attacks, and the antification of male athletes can be achieved - as soon as the male US-Turner reported prior to The Wall Street Journal, then Mr. Dooley expects his ringing to replace new fans.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesticated" in Ethiopia, Long A Allies of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, demand political changes in Ethiopia, fell on violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that fiery protesting during clashes with the police killed at Shussine.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable country, a solid conversaries of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government devoured the country and grew in increasingly more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people overthrew the streets and sorts fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was unmerciful according to human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses issued that policemen were killed on sparkling protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos can be found about protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people strike young people with shocks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Commission for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to maintain this country and in future it will even be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the horn of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence work closely together with Ethiopia, in order to fight terraces over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western assistance.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia economy expanded in considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pendulum type in Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was all another as a model for democracy - human rights organization continuously accepted the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, whereby dissidents have been taken into silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or jail, driven or driven into the pastor of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options besides, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesticated.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are plenty of complaints that cover everything from the land use until your dignity in terms of power of the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a moderate election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for these zackling, controversial line called by life in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear, separatistas such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogake, which were more or less compelled to explored the turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why you want to explode the feeling of deterioration after years of application under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopia were able to communicate with social media, as cheap smartphones were increasingly common, and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government faces the access to Facebook and Twitter, especially in regular distances, especially in protests, many people can communicate with internet proxies that hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopia they gave rise to themselves to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnic ias in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Ethiopia, the Amharas prospered from Ethiopia is mainly in politics and the economy, while they rent the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in Flachland.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the sense that Ethiopia is unfaithfully dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are dominant about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the resting is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death at a non-public sickness in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopia Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly licensed in having to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and special visits to edit opponents and make them innocuous.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing in this basic skill," Mr Abdi said a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected from relatively intransparent reasons to take up the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region in the north-Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he enjoys not the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, Ethiopia, after thousands of elections, in 2005, after thousands of elections proclaimed, the government had seeded and stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razzien many Protestants were killed, even if less than in recent months and those days of the upheavals were quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Major development experts in Ethiopia leaders of their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendulum, as well as for their measurable progress on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensifying of internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesting in Gondar, an amharic city, carried out business in and the hatred towards the Tigray is always more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that protests can bring the USA and other western allies into an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for dron flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently had closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin sheaths."</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump trying to disperse the last consial to disperse his campaign that his repeatedly re-repeated claims, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who would have been the founders "of TERRORGRUPPE Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions to the communication skills of the presidential nomdates of the Republicans, whether he should be able to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow leaders to take him while an eventful phase in protection, to have the actual position in which he could not have meant to be meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he made the announcement of the evening event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made back to the assertion on Thursday and continuance in interviews that he really did not intended to work, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning, Mr. Trump said, he is simply solastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">In contrast to the previous day, Mr. Trump told in a number of interviews that Mr. Trump told me to be completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to destroy something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, wanted to destroy the republican presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of critique jumping on Mr. Trump, while he attempts the focus of his campaign to focus on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked for speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump trying again to return to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">About Twitter always warned that Mrs. Clintons would lead suggestions to higher taxes, and that he found their speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he moved to his strong criticism, as he said, the Russians should make Mrs. Clintons Enamel, but later he said "Of course I said the Sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic borders in politics and then go back to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages of his fans are taken, as they arrive, and then" clear "depending on how the reaction drops." said Ruth Sherman, a communication examination, that observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his failure vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in several ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even burial tone since his surveys have gone on.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a large margin in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head racing in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is trying to avoid excuse for his provocating declarations, he puts his critics often to understand or understand his testimonies.</seg>
<seg id="21">But during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Joze presents his loyal fellow in the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent principalities to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps was asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had created the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, and he called her backbenchers, completely wrong and so did it happened, because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most Mainstream republican try to argue that the government was under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an Foreign Minister, ISIS was to spread out broadly by bringing about the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them on each of his words to fight against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He endefied the poor, emmeric "television hexademy who try to understand him and said," You can't do it. "</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressed food of the economic crisis in a rich meal "</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, after his ascension to the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt became a Faible for refined delicacies at Fifth Avenue, like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland waterskating soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a humble: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act with culinary solidarity with quirety people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn's Heights and are both food historian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" was honed by the Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman tells in her book "97 Orchard" about the life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A permanent meal," will be published on Tuesday in Harper publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the great depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary delights when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop to meet dinner, a small, schnörgy Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been part of the market since the market share in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cream tariff with olive oil, while Coe, 57, Turkey, with mashed potatoes and vegetable soup.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the Reporter Schrowed, this set the couple in a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver loaf and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They have been prepared for an ingredient and a bit inexpensive to strike the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine how many peanuts are to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE smiled.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must be in the stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years prior to Great Depression was the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The teams of women coves for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasted for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans that sent to an hungarian food in the First World War. "a Square Meal" shows the way to which the country was going to be no longer the Schlaraffenland to.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in eating for the Americans a central, tense theme," committed Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was just as tense: mysterious foods such as loaves and casserollen were converted to basic food, the casserole as "wonderful kind, Essensreste," noticed Ziegelman, da Köche could hide unappetite ingredients among a krepent sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dry sausage.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, the year of the centre of American cuisine was a very rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Such mixtures were tried out, since a calorie-calorie and nourishing prefying precedence had precedented to taste or even healthy food.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not any supplement at lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues on: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions are not fit.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of economic recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since then, exaggerated merchants - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the habits of the country is quietly.</seg>
<seg id="33">By talking about recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary buddies" and the challenge, Pampe such as creamy aghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">A square Meal is a feast of historical tidbits.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's response to an hungered citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-Cake-Eating.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly produced the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he made one of the billionfulness man of the world, to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucensauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightful to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would have had the same error, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to statute an upright postmark.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, in case of a house with no interest in flavors of Ms. Roosevelt, the White House brought the boring meal in Washington, but also one of the most advanced food prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our advanced focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as science on food was applied.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple was in writing to have understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother in law - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman remembered: "she actually made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the windmill.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the platter at Eisenberg's were cleared, they drew up a dessert, which she prepared at home: the plum, the President Roosevelt.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a übner trick was, modest recipes to miss a nice name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There were no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Each dipping somewhat resistive a spoon in the teeth, brown Glimpse.</seg>
<seg id="52">Luckily it was not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest spine is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland usually come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark took us back on the aboard of the Sanna's research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good one km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland just got young for 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Due to the North Atlantic, Greenland, the Greenland's foundation is just 1.220 meters, in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it goes up, accelerates the five meters long beast to 2.5 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">That of long-solving lifestyle seems to be an industrial concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen, at the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal "Science" in any part of a Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," ented Alexander scouring from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the Evolutionary biologe has long been long to be stoned in Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sepulls are difficult to observe, lastly, they live in the Eismeer in front of the sparsely populated coastal areas of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they usually occur in the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Explorer researchers know about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time track snakes up they, as they concealed six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, and another one had swallowed to bone a young ice bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they sleep sleeping animals or patropack at the bottom of the ice cream and search the Kadaver that torches out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues, 28 Greenland was tried to catch the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard, as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, the biggest 502 centimeters size.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyse the line-core of the shark with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already emerges before the birth of the sharks which are contained in the presence of proteins later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had so much carbon-14 in lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when atomic cycles try greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast to 220 centimeters length of third smallest animal, the lentices contained a low distention of carbon-14 from the atomic afford, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens, all larger Greenland, however, had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 o'clock showed a 493-centimetres long Greenland at the age of 335, while the record shark with 502 centimetres should be a 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Greenland-female, Grönlandhai-females finally get offspring if they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">The researchers of the length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland itself has obviously taken over a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That there is no coincidence that such methusal use mainly live in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland, in his bacon a 120 year old harpoon tip was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures often the organism of living animals still runs on ascorrosive environments.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature quickly - and swors slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm, the animals are often very big in the cold water.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface, thanks to the animal warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram Mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives in more dangerous and should focus on keeping as many descendants as early as possible," explains the Evolutionsbiologist Schattlein as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should rather invest its resources in long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner's largest last night in the manor team in the Velodrom in Rio towards the fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor of his fellow countryman, Sir Chris Hoy celebrated his legend, when he hurrided home to home a victory from the New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">In England four years ago, England claimed a shocked win during Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they were in March by train world championships in London despite the withdrawal Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the substitute for Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that tried by Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man, when they stayed, when they saw potential in the shallots, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the past four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner jumped in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings, the New Zealanders were winning in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the fight with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his turn back barely back, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy changes made a major part of the transformation, in the execution of a higher course to slow down it and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to maintain the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw it from his position as BBC expert and did Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Around the final round, we have placed an Olympic marina and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the page of Kenny and Hoys stood there, that after a weak start fell down on the railway line.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no contradiction of Englands Rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">Such a superior victory there was no problem for this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "it feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly at so much World titels so it was incredible to win back during the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that were won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If a barometer is our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is possible in the area of the Possible, that he repeated the victory of three Olympic medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be used for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (a shining date for the British sport; on the day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) were awarded a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cage of Hoy same.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint race, which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">28-year-old Bolton said: "I enjoy this just for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels quite lonely, to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said, "When he wins two gold medals, he should be defeated a knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medallion competition in the day but there was another good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 5942 on the target.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, who won gold in London in 2012 was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the race, where Wiggins won the focus on behalf of the Wiggins.</seg>
<seg id="42">He was contested yesterday with the accused, as officials of the qualification, to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the speaking world competition, the morning continued, and finished, avancied Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong railway team to dominate the medium period of the Olympic Games and to catch a shadow of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly outstanding representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">They played in the background, as the resignation of the technical chief of Shane Sutton, in April, surrounded by sex music and bullying contactors as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees itself the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks quite after that the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at a perfect moment, will again be repeated.</seg>

<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the SPD fell by 15.6 percent in five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to poll, the party only remains just ahead of the CDU, which could go back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is contested between the left and the AfD.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and taller, it was therefore not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite knock.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory at the beginning was eight megabytes, which would reach today for about two selenium.</seg>

<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can still buy equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the rock life of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as "Office in the Westentrop format."</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus were probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the history of the Venus based on tools and algorithms which resemble from climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have been proven to have similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have earlier pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their density atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, inherited atmosphere and slowly improved.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet devotes out more dry areas than the earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to give life and safeguard life against life.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun, which was 30 percent of a matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the CIISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus its daily side of the sun was almost two months long," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio stated in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, causing a umbrella to get the surface of much of the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of the Venus that resembles the evolution that previously carried out by Planetensearched.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they probably had habitable, the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --too much heat and ultraviolet light was exposed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans has evaporated and your water vapor was distilled from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen dropped only a thick atmosphere on carbon dioxide, with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven to have been proven as a masked means for Doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, just around 0.09 seconds, it missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have to participate in the precursor over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="13">For the first time in history, not more the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanctions of athletes involving positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio, the news about the positive test at Danekowa courtesy of the 33-year-old did not reflect on the offensive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datacleau: get perfide and hers your ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted to targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey on the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes, under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies have been at least once, partly several victims of an attack with expresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already achieved a ranking in Ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid willingly to use the workers required to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialise their expressions software according to the observations of Malwarebytes gradually to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially to erpress release drops significantly higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we currently watch a terrifying quick evolution of the malware software," explains Malwarebytes-chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the hardware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the Tattoo expressed software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target but the change went back to company attacks during the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once upon the computer of a victim, they seek targeted according to unknown files such as Word-, Excel- or Database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software will be presenting the demands of the expressions.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end key code to the files you need to pay money - usually in the form of the Cryptovern Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private use the personal photo database is on the game, it's for companies around sensible client data or project databases, without which the production stillaries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a Ransomware is covered.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies posted sales losses through Ransomware, 13 percent, even operations had to break from business in a case of living conditions.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were already victim of attacks, whose patients could be threatened by loss of ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the sacrifices always: pay not, you only encourages the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay you will get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it's difficult to refuse the demand of the perpetrators in the operation of a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again appreciate this and try to build a good replica.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study, the safety forscher of F-Secure Notes and contact with the surveys have also examined and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain their sacrifices via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, setup freely accessible support sites, or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will be redeemed private cars after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must negotiate hard and have five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively risk-based profits from the Ransomware-Erpressing become more professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski, from the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write about one week within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, it is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software in the form of a software package to the actual expressions.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits developed by the malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, firm price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery is an adaptant, so that smaller configurations, look and branding," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaids are looking for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one is logged into one of the forums in the underground, buying a set by criminals and commissioned to install the software to as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made of infuser calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"normally, the criminals then use spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of the companies IT-responsibilities in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware are able to weep using file back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">The valleys already pursues new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient menace for successful exploring after the release of sensitive data, such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is equivalent to damage potential, depending on the type of data still a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">Valleys also could have completely new goals in the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Stcon demonstrate security forgers how to get a thermostat under their control with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the immersion of such a blocking heating could quite be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the valleys rather than heating in the future you block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be included in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around, at night you wake up for hours, even in the morning it is no longer able to think any more of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">All of this is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, you are with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel often to sleep in their sleep.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep changes?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are manifold concerns of them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlaffessionand Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whatever understands, but the Insomnia is never, therefore an entry and breakthrough disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even so many people feel unsatisfying or insufficient, says Jens Wagenkncht, member of the German occupational association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep changes?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep changes are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it may be organic, mental or restrained factors, but drugs are plugging.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep disturbed of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awwaking is mostly seen with depression often," says Yahweh.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors quote one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whoever has a herniated disc, it can be bad, wakes up all two to three hours and starts to blurred over everyday problems and caring, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is not possible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Whoever does not sleep well over a month during a month of at least three nights per week, the doctor should go to a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look very different: it is smitten, tired, unhatched, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has stimulation fluctuations or physical complaints like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve the sleep disturbed, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioural changes, a cognitive behavior of conduct or drugs - classic sleep tablet only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there is hardly, in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary insomy medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should consult the physician at bedtime, laugh Weeß in case of sleep problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with studies, if problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in sleep, and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in sleep laboratory, Mediociner for example at snoring with breathing exercises, in sick person or if you don't find the cause of a breakep disorder, explains fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the test.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please make any lunch sleep," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After being cuttled, one walks into the bed for its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Next to the electrode, man bears a nose-neck, a chest strap and a feelers at his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also records a camera on the ceiling to the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those interested problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many slot screws that can be applied for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because it counts: regular sleeping and downtimes, not too long in bed, not sleep to sleep on the day, don't watch TV to sleep, stop drinking and at night, you are beginning to reckon, and that's all or not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbuildung, a few horsemesters, still a rest of head bellows: the rigaer street in Berlin-Friedrichshain looks not at the first glance, but the police counts it among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">One walks down the road from east to west, following playing fields, a refreshing kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" is trying to see the facade of a grey house! "</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which should also be demolished, it will be built: until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new homes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about these "trendy city district," like the competent real estate company Friedrichshain, however, are preferred to bilateral with burning cars in the last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, the inhabitants had rented rent motions, on the ground floor are still rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin interior of internal eyes has been very hard for a hard action of the police at the beginning of the year, the area referred to as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous force.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the 22nd June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor, the cadets of Kadets, with 300 police officers have been cleared, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars in front of the road, kept parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the temporarily renovated building workers on behalf of unknown homeowners the spaces.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal and one day later moved police and workers under the Jubel of Sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the chief of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives since 1999 in the Kiez, and Jana *, who generators here three children, are primarily driven by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The residents of the skin projects they share the worries before rising rents and garments.</seg>
<seg id="15">It sounds like a Kiez that wished mostly mostly on police in front of vandalizing linkage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The hubs, the Berlin interior of Berlin, and police between squatters and their neighbors, exists this obviously not.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the east of Berlin, Friedrichshain had actually been a traditional working quarter, which also has a lower average income and high poverty level in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hausungen and the native living projects belong to the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under big roadside, many of the projects have been legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited today by the people who occupied they around 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district over the last few years has become the magnets for tourists and polling liners from all over the world: now share their local residents from East German times and former home occupied their lapse.</seg>
<seg id="21">This has also noticeably perceived by the rents which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you recognizes them on collated discs or freshly painted facades that have been rejected with colour.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words "linksautonome violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that not all neighbours could not be seen as a problem, that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offences such as body injury and statistics speak almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of criminal offences make facts tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, cannot be a speech of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violence is stated, it is more important: the people in 94 are their neighbours that were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rigaer longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For study Architectin, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you can meet each other, lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is conscious of the Rigs Street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thus, it was so important that the people had returned to their street: from the police, politics, and the media that stressed the devotion over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants as Neugebauer, the road will continue to take care of them: by sighted new buildings in former sizes that adheres the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are the last dominiums flat flats, which are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well betrotated," says she.</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction are I absolutely not guiding."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone hears any one?</seg>
<seg id="36">There lies on all sides frustration, even at the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer little understanding: Kerstin Neugebauer little understanding: the hbonding projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev.</seg>

<seg id="5">The social pedagogical team assists the management team by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact partner for all players: refugees, refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else could be mixed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that the honest of honest are more than grateful that Deuschl now is there, the greening wool melchsau that has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less enjoyable as much to the multitude of desirable expenses - meant that the administration wanted to write off.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for a management system with a talent for tongues and people, associated with many years of experience in the field of social work, just terrestrial wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not their central area, among others Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially go to organisation, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network surplus.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been involved since approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has lasted for a 50-percent point on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was highest time," says Regine client supported by Annika Deuschle ehren- and host official actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and comprehensibility problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are available in the wasig street</seg>
<seg id="17">There is a serious problem since some time to find apartments for connecting hoses that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities shall be responsible for connection of connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations have to carry the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibilities changes from the State Council to local and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there is free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed as very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto do not find the administration of private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It didn't work so far so you have been instructed for private apartments so deuschl.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore common apartments have to be used as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">There will be a new container which will be installed in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with appartement is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm lead, there are interns, training places, training places, training places, one-Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that need to set up or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help caring, experience nonprofit work - and motivated and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work is leading to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity is however not only labour.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed facility, say decule and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a feassion feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sport, contacts with locals and especially speaking courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump here administration and honorary officials.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally that the refugees won the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it takes and it can be bridged in time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who evolve sometime in Urbach, could not work in Urbach and may not work and be unprofitable to never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The most distinct majority be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, however, says customer honest, "people with which nothing works." the work of deuschl and client is therefore always also to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this was a "mammotherence". "</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two most recent advancing of Radicalisation, also in a small municipality like Urbach?</seg>

<seg id="50">Sensibilts be the helper but already.</seg>

<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassinter will bring them complete in distortion.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with" says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, Hauptst- and honorary people must look at local and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have a new building on refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question, the policy will fail.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the uranium used to integrate hitherly to previous people.</seg>
