the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is not just friendly .
they want to discuss the implementation of international agreement as well as in T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ izing action in the Middle East .
however , at the meeting , there should also be a conflict with the Palest@@ in@@ ians and the discussed two @-@ States solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is open for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the den@@ ying sett@@ le@@ ments of Israel and casts Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u man@@ ned will during the peace process .
the deal of the I@@ ran@@ ian nuclear programme was wor@@ sen@@ ing with the Obama &apos;s relation to the I@@ ran@@ ian nuclear programme .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u had held a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can in front of the US Congress , which was par@@ ed against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel .
in a not@@ ary , professor , his girl@@ friend got shot
in a not@@ able call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told me of a little voice of the police that he had shot his girl@@ friend and that the offici@@ als would have to come to his house .
Lamb was also important to wor@@ ry that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but he was che@@ ered and probably exc@@ ited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead could be found on the phone .
within the house , the offici@@ als found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that I wanted to do it , I loved it and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was the only woman who had ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who has been travelling in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , learned about 300 miles to the school year , where he was directed by the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ em@@ ef Lynn Bu@@ ford told that University staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made a fatal emerg@@ encies until then .
until the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb took his life as the police cap@@ tiv@@ ated him .
a day after the shooting in the university , students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind doors , trying to hide behind the closed doors , still a picture of which be@@ ats me motiv@@ ated .
details published by the Agency on both ends of the state , details , as well what students and staff who knew him did , helped us to draw a picture of a tal@@ ented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students told that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , he said , have no history of violence or criminal inten@@ tion .
in a book , Lamb himself had mentioned a book written in him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he divided his academic life .
both suppliers in the Department of Social Sciences and History , members of 17 members include , and many students visited the courses of both .
at the same time there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations on proble@@ matic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb , said he seemed a little exc@@ ited and ner@@ vous , &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to take care of health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he has taught only two online courses .
latest changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for the Lamb , had so hard to work for him no guarantee for an automatic trip to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he know nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
that are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the Campus police found the police later Lam@@ bs track , when he entered the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ark@@ ans@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 Kal@@ iber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why the lamb went to this house , but Johnson told that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work on the university which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , established Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doc@@ torate in spring in spring .
one of the long term friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 , and the lamb was 20 when they met together through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy , who tried to teach the guitar player some years .
he was then the Black Forest .
all the girls were mel@@ ted when he was , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency said , Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning which lived with them in the back@@ stone house that bor@@ dered to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were left over 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who had been 19 years old .
&quot; it was completely destroyed by the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met me , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and bl@@ ues played .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail first appeared in the summer of three years ago .
later they played together one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a n@@ urse which worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , that he had closed the Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night at night 5 . September for the last time , after Lamb had its guitar and harmon@@ ica .
there was no signs that something did not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were to the au@@ gh@@ ers and j@@ ing@@ ing together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of she@@ ar .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialized on American U@@ n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kan@@ sas and served as President of his Br@@ other@@ hood and Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and including lec@@ tur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the assembly at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ it commemor@@ ative party .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the demonstration , &quot; Bright Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing Grace . &quot;
the classes will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to returning , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s told Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans were contributed to this report .
this story was correc@@ ted to reflect the police now said that Lamb seemed to be shot , and that Lamb seemed to be shot , and that Lamb seemed to be heard in his emergency Prague as his wife , but there is no indication of that the two ever got married .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also not@@ able for personal reasons .

UN b@@ oss says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon says that the answer to Russia has reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; for almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen for millions of people .
the UN b@@ oss encour@@ aged all parties , including the split UN Security Council , to con@@ form an integr@@ ative and integr@@ ative negotiations to finance a political solution .
it follows a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Council - the USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the Council meeting to discuss the situation in Syria .
he re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted that the adv@@ ances in the Council and Regional powers &quot; and Regional powers &quot; this situation is in@@ sol@@ uble . &quot;
Ban still challeng@@ ed the five constant members to demonstr@@ ate the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which have proven the use of a nuclear de@@ als containing Iran .
8 Sur@@ ro@@ age@@ able values indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to fire him as a flop .
others did it as a joke .
and some waiting for a collap@@ se .
but no matter how some re@@ publi@@ can try to drag the run of Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper abdom@@ en upon survey@@ s , it does not work .
ten of the last eleven national survey@@ s show Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit area , and some start to ask for serious things that mean for the nom@@ ination of the real estate business .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ cur@@ ys was handed over to the asc@@ ending Herman Cain , of which none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but foreign groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conserv@@ ative economic group Club for Growth are now recogn@@ iz@@ able tr@@ umps and start their dollars to over@@ throw it .
here are some of the current pol@@ l values indicate that the real estate business is not only a temporary phase :
m@@ umps has turned 180 degrees to the same time .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ can have seen the real estate business .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
it was 52 percent in early August .
now six of 10 Republi@@ can have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and those numbers keep in early states .
in I@@ owa , a Qu@@ inn@@ ip@@ i@@ ac tuning in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thir@@ ds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with ump than candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either thr@@ illed either . &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; an@@ no@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Carson manages to tell about the same enthusi@@ asm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; insp@@ ires &quot; vs. 40 percent , which will say the same on tr@@ ump ) .
the next in enthusi@@ asm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 % of the re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers think they would be &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; an@@ no@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ish@@ ments that would become candidate .
a majority of re@@ publi@@ can see conduc@@ tion temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely being critic@@ ized for its bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ul@@ ding statements that the real estate business must have the right temper@@ ament for a pre@@ sid@@ ents , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first drop @-@ down state of nation , to the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of re@@ publi@@ can think he has the personality of a com@@ mander , according to Qu@@ inn@@ ip@@ i@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to execute effectively his job , and almost six of 10 Independent states that his temper@@ ament are not into the White House , so ABC / Post .
re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers get to the idea .
when they put up their hon@@ est hil@@ ly , re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ er tr@@ ump must be real .
if they are asked , those who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee will say , according to a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since the date when four of ten towards her money raised to Je@@ w Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the cle@@ ar@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Republi@@ can Americans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomin@@ ee for only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers will be seen as pl@@ au@@ cr@@ ate campaign .
even though the Re@@ public@@ ans collected himself for another candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost everyone .
some experts indicate that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably con@@ tributes to tr@@ umps , while the anti @-@ b@@ ump support is distributed over a do@@ zen of other candidates diff@@ rac@@ ed .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other re@@ publi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump support multiple support .
by front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points , and finally vor Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate , who propos@@ es him ?
Ben Carson would over@@ take the entre@@ pren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head racing .
a fl@@ ap majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans said that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump will certainly have their voices .
of course , things can be done to change that , and no one can really say , never change my opinion .
46 percent said that they open the door open to other candidates .
yet , Tr@@ ump is strongest contest at the moment of other out@@ seas , the Neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Carson , but vot@@ ers that they have formed their opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 re@@ publi@@ can say that they co@@ inc@@ ide with Tr@@ ump on the topic of immig@@ ration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his campaign launched two months ago immig@@ rants from Mexico , &quot; the Im@@ migration &quot; and the point of the public dis@@ course was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic ex@@ pres@@ sions of Tr@@ ump dec@@ ides H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ American from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ oriented efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post Group on Monday , six of 10 re@@ publi@@ can tell that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immig@@ ration .
so long as the Im@@ migration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it .
the fru@@ str@@ ation over the government climbed to new limits .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Carson , there is now half of the assistance of re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially by their foreign journalists .
six of 10 re@@ publi@@ can say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they would prefer a political field than someone with government experience .
and they are also fur@@ ious to Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg shows two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ can have been fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satis@@ factory and 21 percent &quot; hard@@ wood . &quot;
Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential distri@@ cts in Germany
here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you find the most expensive residential community - with views over North Sea forever .
in the street a floor area of a roof terrace is 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sylt is the supply of objects of natur@@ al@@ onia , &quot; it means that the high price is therefore .
a new study shows in which particular layers cost a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living areas , however , one of the price comes as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel@@ s &amp; Völ@@ kers published one ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ ers@@ .
there are several times a thousand Euros n@@ ix - per square meter , well known .
but good , who can aff@@ ord it ...
by the way : Munich is not close to the tip here .
Champions League : Bavaria &apos;s Dream Date thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
dual tor@@ ches in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller took the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympic Pi@@ re@@ aus - then ran .
a so@@ vereign re@@ opening of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan &apos;s Wit@@ ch Bo@@ re@@ aus on FC Bayern .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ up play in the Champions League near the Greek record player in hot atmosphere thanks to rub@@ bing double pack ( 5@@ 2. / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ it hits ( 8@@ .09 . ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th Star@@ ter@@ fol@@ g in series will be the first step towards the finale will be in Italy on May 28 , 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ p@@ ott to Munich .
in his 28th , hit in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guidance of the Olympics of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper Roberto , who would pass through the master &apos;s thought of the world master .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game at Kar@@ a@@ isk@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 Prussian fans - and the Munich kept His word .
they showed a focused and committed performance without sh@@ ines .
Piraeus had won the youngest six home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , among them against renowned clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 there are also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , would not want to be the next sacrifice .
they had bra@@ ve to work with their revealed efforts , but often to pieces of works .
the attacks were often led to the di@@ str@@ action on Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa , with the early Braunschwe@@ iger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i sel@@ dom .
Müller had more luck from the right to beat out as his flange from the right hal@@ le@@ field in the upper upper door .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski was the best occas@@ ions in half .
first , when the af@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown proposed the battle of Poland from the line ( 26th ) .
then via direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper Roberto is prepared with the kne@@ e ( 35@@ th ) .
although Bavaria served their usual game , Piraeus could put the No@@ adel@@ st@@ iche in Piraeus .
at Tor@@ hil@@ ly Manuel Neuer was a discount .
for example , when he de@@ fle@@ w a kiss of ide@@ ye over the fle@@ ece ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in addition , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola built a quad@@ ru@@ ple chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze after mus@@ cular problems back in the pool , sat at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said something different from it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the wo@@ unded Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all about 13 minutes later , when El@@ f@@ metres ordered him again .
before the game was found ti@@ dy in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partial Bavaria fans in their audience block obviously had the fol@@ lowers of hosts Piraeus with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and entered with drum st@@ ats against the Munich trailer .
at least a Bavaria fan was in@@ ju@@ red from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
w@@ ho@@ ever smo@@ kes , it isn &apos;t only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : when sets the risk dec@@ ay quickly .
smo@@ kers have a clearly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this proce@@ eds from the long @-@ term study of an international research team including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to Nich@@ ols , the risk of losing their teeth for 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,6 @-@ F@@ ache higher .
the scientists had watched more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dent@@ ures are car@@ ies and inflamm@@ ation of the g@@ ums , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these par@@ od@@ ontal disease smoking is a risk factor , bet@@ s the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore go back to frequent to@@ g@@ ums in smoking .
not be clar@@ ified , smoking also increases the risk of car@@ ies .
people who have heard with smoking , but could reduce their risk in a short time and re@@ sign the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years , until the end@@ ang@@ ering re@@ sted to the level of Nich@@ ol@@ auch@@ ern , &quot; first author Thomas Dietrich von der English University of Birmingham .
people are con@@ vince with it to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , the director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and guides according to our in@@ sights , too good health service to the high age .
more than 20 per cent of the population are affected by co@@ el@@ ess@@ ness in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 and 74 .
previous studies had already mentioned that smoking will answer the risk of early dent@@ ity .
the new long @-@ term study evaluated the findings .

EU Commission propos@@ es in dis@@ pute over the T@@ TIP new court
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ r@@ ary system to valid@@ ate the current tran@@ si@@ ent free trade agreement T@@ TIP for the planned trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP .
the contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al private laying equipment for disp@@ utes between corpor@@ ations and states are to be replaced with a transparent system that is clear in its function significantly more traditional courts .
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens &quot; stated the competent EU Com@@ mission@@ er in Cecilia Malm@@ ström .
the Swe@@ din has the proposal to bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade relations with the USA .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP should be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
plans for reform of the current refer@@ ral procedures can be noted that the EU states and the U.S. have shared an independent judge for a new investment court .
they should come to the EU , the US and the third States .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against the jud@@ g@@ ments .
to date , the procedure involved in arbit@@ rat@@ ors , a claims against the jud@@ g@@ ments were not given .
in the discussion of last months it was clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in Fair@@ ness and Justice didn &apos;t trust , comm@@ ented Malm@@ ström .
in the long run she wants to work for an international investment court .
for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clar@@ ified there .
the Invest@@ or @-@ Sta@@ ats @-@ Ar@@ bit@@ ration Pro@@ cedure ( IS@@ DS ) apply as one of the main reasons for major resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration shall be critical of oppon@@ ents than a species of parall@@ el@@ ism to extend the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations such as Camp@@ act reported the proposals from the European Commission as in@@ sufficient .
critic@@ ism was above all that they should not apply for the previously hand@@ signed free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ n@@ ig ( SPD ) described the plans for a great progress .
the Commission regard the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has been exp@@ ecting the Prime Minister with exc@@ it@@ ement with Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns since his election .
the new Labour president Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n should announce his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise in order to be the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , where@@ by his performance of the media is likely to be checked by the Labour De@@ pu@@ ties .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; for this weekly event .
he also said that he could sk@@ ip some meetings to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary testing for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because it comes after its appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ir@@ on@@ inet@@ ts and following his speech at the Tu@@ c annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the Sing@@ ing National hy@@ mn with a commemor@@ ative ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Sil@@ ence , will pro@@ vo@@ ke the critic@@ ism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands in the centre of several titles @-@ Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not to sing the national hy@@ mn , has attention to itself
a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had st@@ olen &quot; in respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognised the &quot; her@@ o@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he told the Labour Chairman , &quot; independent of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a do@@ zen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they conven@@ ed themselves on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth order of the Par@@ liamentary Party had originally supported him as a guide .
the political respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ ch says that political differences will also be st@@ ackable within Labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns explic@@ ations on position to European Union and the Lim@@ itation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c conference that Labour has proposed changes to remove the whole idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of employment and pen@@ sions @-@ ministers , that the party &quot; very clear &quot; was that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour Chairman , David Cameron and since he has been T@@ ory b@@ oss , in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour Chair , who promised another polit@@ ician claims , says he has been &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; Ide@@ as for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggest@@ ions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that it is un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented to con@@ front@@ end the Prime Minister , and that he has been made to concentrate on serious problems like poverty , in@@ equality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , who receives the sh@@ adows of the Economic Council with him if he is not , for example , if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought the idea to inv@@ ent that other colleagues are occas@@ ionally distur@@ bed , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , which was dem@@ anded of the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he was tied to the politics of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; which is often associated with the Frag@@ ran@@ ty of the Prime Minister . however , he dre@@ amed a few years later he had failed .
when she was first broadcast on TV in 1990 , the quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the leader and his leadership under his par@@ agr@@ aph@@ s , although crit@@ ics have ar@@ gu@@ ed , they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and re@@ ap@@ oration re@@ forms .

the Po@@ und was sigh@@ ted according to data , showing an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the security area SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the results were growing without bonuses in the UK by 2.9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage had been the fastest and earned in@@ estim@@ ation on the time of interest in interest since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were by encour@@ aging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ emont 0.9 % .
Rich@@ ard@@ on@@ ts &apos;s newest sales figures showed up all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - will be dis@@ continued to growth again .

the cost could be able to hit by JD Sports , added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs .

the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name called &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Just@@ in yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
since 7 am , the Pol@@ in has been sitting on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz in the cold stone plate in the Berlin Luxury hotel .
the Bie@@ ber building : here you reach I@@ do@@ l , whose posters hung up in St@@ ett@@ in , since Monday night .
the Suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , is as much as their mom@@ my E@@ wa deser@@ ves half a year .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster depicting Lib@@ an@@ esen on potato d@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
both - and although in the potato be@@ et@@ ers , the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al @-@ itzer ( Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay ) has developed .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato instead of dou@@ bles &quot; on a poster of the PE@@ GI@@ DA movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat is put together on a ske@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster with a PE@@ GI@@ DA demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV .
since then there is a grill ske@@ wer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ tic@@ ultur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea of Leb@@ anese man has now turned to be in Munich in the meantime .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility pattern .
as much meat and as much potatoes of ske@@ wer does , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to gu@@ ess .
only so much : &quot; it tast@@ es better , &quot; he finds .
even with his customers the culinary festival is appro@@ aching .
Met@@ cash launches ground @-@ stable base campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - in@@ fall
Met@@ cash des@@ ires to protect the I@@ GA stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor @-@ permanent recovery to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in the advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di inv@@ asion .
while Al@@ di prepared two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of the next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets with local gro@@ cer@@ ies suppliers and re@@ build the brand I@@ GA by ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adelaide Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jumping on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ erst@@ or@@ ist Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who is spread in I@@ GA @-@ shops , and distri@@ but@@ ing tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loy@@ al customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defence strategy on 29 September , if the whol@@ es@@ aler goes on food , alcohol and devices through the yearly investors strategy .
it stands a lot on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia util@@ ize almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margin as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically pro@@ vin@@ ely and I@@ GA retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - over 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in Western Australia .
however , an@@ alysts expect such as Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di will acceler@@ ate five percent of the market in these two countries , and all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ retailers &quot; sales will be removed .
a report published in this week was according to analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley that I@@ GA retail@@ er will lose 360 $ million sales per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million to the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ gn@@ osis is based on the ass@@ umption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , generating revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and gro@@ cer@@ y store and with the amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million pre @-@ interest rates and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , met@@ cash bonds tre@@ ats in the eastern part , mainly to Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA reb@@ ates are the most loy@@ est .
Morgan Stan@@ ley is growing that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales grow by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.1 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish D@@ oug@@ lass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business partner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably be dis@@ appear within a decade .
Met@@ cash dis@@ missed it , not respon@@ d to the comments of Mr D@@ oug@@ lass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr D@@ oug@@ lass last week has received contact .
I@@ GA@@ s market share since 2010 fell by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food retail , which has about 1,200 I@@ GA tra@@ der tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers , which has fallen by 43 per cent , which reflec@@ ts the operating debt reduction in terms of sales and mar@@ gins since 2012 .
however , the whol@@ es@@ aler b@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to improve sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths with hundreds of products every week to improve fresh food and produce a better selection of private label foo@@ d@@ stu@@ ffs .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjust@@ ments and charging programmes for ver@@ ve are expected and ho@@ ping for the first time to return to a profit in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis b@@ ands Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves praise as critic@@ ism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; Col@@ lateral destruction &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and ear@@ ns to view of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as critic@@ ism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger family of tal@@ ented Du@@ os , which is increasingly referred to as &quot; Special Ks &quot; by the not@@ or@@ ious de@@ pression of Cy@@ gi@@ os and St@@ an WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters into the lim@@ el@@ ight .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent &apos;s Ryan Har@@ rison had to hit twice by the arbit@@ r@@ ator : &quot; WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA would have to sm@@ ite Kyr@@ gi@@ os and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ acket , after having a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by Heal@@ y and def@@ ended by Heal@@ y .
the te@@ ens currently has been in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single country behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final .
&quot; one thing , about which I am rather ere@@ wor@@ e , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little into dis@@ pute , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
he has broken a bat if he lost one of a cr@@ amp@@ er in the US Open , but he &apos;s not the first player who has been broken with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of them .
but really , he really enjoyed themselves in the U.S. OPEN extreme behaviour , even under the quite prov@@ oc@@ ative circumstances , with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved much appreci@@ ation .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I believe that he was a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never worked on his team and so on , he has never trained a problem with other players , he is a very stable and well @-@ mature young guy , and I believe he deser@@ ves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team focused completely on competition , and not all around the contro@@ ver@@ si@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick made very quickly the asc@@ en@@ sion , which he gets in the eyes of the spring and he ear@@ ns to support him . some time out of the lim@@ el@@ ight , that he can think that it is best for the crew , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary declar@@ es Not@@ with@@ standing , maint@@ ains refugees
Hungary explains the emergency and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the firm@@ ly tried to get illeg@@ ally in the land . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of mig@@ rants .
chaos followed at the border , hundreds of mig@@ rants in a Ni@@ em@@ ian border were re@@ acted with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who fled before violence were set up for an unknown time in a land@@ line between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there .
but fruity increased .
as a police helicopter over them , the mig@@ rants &apos; must open the limit ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian will@@ ing@@ ness .
some stands out from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it to be &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that mig@@ rants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision damage .
there must be con@@ vers@@ ations in Brussels and other countries in the coming days , I@@ vica Dac@@ ic told in Prague .
the tur@@ bul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border could not agree on a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a str@@ ing@@ ful meeting in Brussels .
however , the minister agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were in over@@ r@@ ying Italy and Greece ; they expressed their hope in the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would result in that the EU states would expect a further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria needed a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immig@@ ration crisis of the continent .
Hungary however did not put his ho@@ pes on a bal@@ ancing action by Brussels or his neighbo@@ urs .
the not@@ ary announced on Tuesday in two southern regions gave up more findings to the crisis of the crisis , allowing them to acceler@@ ate streets and asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also has the construction of a bar@@ bed wire ever along its border to Romania , to stop the state of mig@@ rants through the country , after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ als in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has existed for the most upcoming economic refugees who are in search of a better life , and not war@@ fare , which is strong in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) high Za@@ us who set up the government along the southern border with Serbia . these laws also put a higher adhesion for convic@@ ted tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; because of the situation that occurred through the mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ ters in the southern town of Sze@@ ged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament has to appro@@ ve the use of the military , but re@@ porter open@@ ly is expected for next week , but re@@ porter from Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , the Land Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already lower@@ ed into the country .
they come down by dam@@ aging the fence , and they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are to repair the fence quick .
Hungarian Be@@ am@@ te also closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the limits .
chaos conv@@ ene the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ ari@@ ans opened a small office in a metal container to stabil@@ ise the data of people and have a crowd pressing in order to go there .
about 20 succeeded to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of mig@@ rants blocked the most important highway connection of Serbia and Hungary , and said that they should ref@@ use food and water until they travel to Hungary .

the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to maintain a double @-@ digit in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders wins it towards the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers with the inc@@ idents ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is on second place , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t pron@@ oun@@ ced if he t@@ ends for the Pre@@ sidential office , with support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pre@@ sidential elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion concerns what candidates will support .
but Clin@@ tons suppor@@ ters are in charge of their choice than one of the other candidates .
in the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had posted some profits .
Clinton maint@@ ains a big advantage in women and temper@@ ate , but these jumps are reduced .
their support in the men has sunk clearly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons &apos; benefit with democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years of age dis@@ cour@@ aged and they are now on the same height .
Clinton has still a huge advantage in older vot@@ ers .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders had a 5 point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pre@@ sidential elections say that they would support with enthusi@@ asm Clinton if they would be nominated by the Party .
a quarter would only support them with some projects and support another 15 percent because they are only supported because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons is current suppor@@ ters above all of you .
the views are stronger with those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would insp@@ ire them .
as 48 per cent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the inc@@ idents say they support Clinton with enthusi@@ asm that less re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers do this through their nick@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ ers Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons Unter@@ st@@ üt@@ ter is asked in an open question , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 per cent ) , followed by that time is that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best can@@ did@@ acy for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
also suppor@@ ters of Clin@@ tons to support Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to deal with problems and vot@@ ability are also quot@@ ed .
since the vice president makes a potential for the pre@@ sidential office in the commod@@ ity , 57 per cent of the democratic vot@@ ers want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers asked of pre@@ sidential elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
by Clin@@ tons tags say more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far apart from S@@ anders .
Bi@@ den decided to can@@ on@@ ize the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , who increases Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s subur@@ bs up to S@@ anders , from 20 points to Bi@@ den in the race for 30 points without him in the race .
forty @-@ five percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a can@@ did@@ acy with the best chances of winning the choice ; however this figure fell from 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that list@@ ened to him as the &quot; selectable &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , when the question is more important , the Democratic vot@@ ers asked questions about the vot@@ ers .
simil@@ arly as in the last month there was no single democr@@ atically candidate or pot@@ ent candidate for these vot@@ ers as un@@ acceptable .
the candidates or potential candidates make good results with some important characteristics in vot@@ ers of their party .
others consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
bi@@ den cuts for the three candidates at the best in hon@@ esty , whereas Clin@@ tons &apos;s power is the leadership .
thirty per cent of the democratic vot@@ ers do not believe Clinton &apos;s hon@@ est and tru@@ sting is , twice as many say that above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not think of him .
Democratic vot@@ ers of the pre@@ sidential elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers did not think differ@@ ently .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s account has been put to the account of a personal e @-@ mail address and one server during the period of office , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers are satisfied with their statement of issue and say that their opinions has not yet been affected .
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans now is un@@ satisfied with their declaration while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came light .
most Americans say that the E @-@ Mail con@@ contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deter@@ ior@@ ated .
they are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 that are worse in Clinton &apos;s opinions .
although Clinton of the vot@@ ers of their party is considered to be hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy : only 32 percent see them as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than in May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for a hon@@ est and tru@@ sted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the voting rights have also see tr@@ ump than non @-@ hon@@ est and not tru@@ sted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes at guide .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Carson and Bush list hon@@ esty on hon@@ esty .
a majority look rather to be hon@@ est , but like at Carson many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 vot@@ ers during pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson returns in land@@ es@@ further survey near Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Carson is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
by the other candidates , half of the vot@@ ers will fall in the new survey , and others will lose dram@@ atically .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grew from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey which was carried out before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Carson approved in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the pol@@ l also revealed that Carson arri@@ ves in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass tr@@ ump under re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ ich , has fallen with knowledge of Govern@@ or Scott Walker , who has fallen in deep@@ est the last month at now 2 % .
the former Florida Govern@@ or Je@@ w Bush , the former Govern@@ or of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee , and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ ge in the sample of 376 persons of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Carson increases in the survey@@ s - he arri@@ ves with 19 % support for the Republi@@ can , behind the b@@ ump with 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump in front of Carson .
with sight on one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side cut marks for the former neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ gen even after Carson con@@ stru@@ ct himself to question Tr@@ ump belief in question .
&quot; we need energy &quot; said Tr@@ ump to I@@ owa last Saturday during a campa@@ igns of I@@ owa .
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even though top values are measured just in distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find still warm water .
a swim in the north or Baltic Sea is to be quite a pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
there is no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the north and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
swimming temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the East it is up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is on 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ other@@ hood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch college ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student while a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ kl@@ es were filed against five people .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ 405 Br@@ other@@ hood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a entry rit@@ u@@ als in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared with them .
official said , he was charged with bl@@ ind@@ ed eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and he was repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ain@@ ted about head@@ aches , and then he fell conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ 771 br@@ other@@ hood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g later and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to goo@@ gling its symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national pre@@ sid@@ ents of the Br@@ other@@ hood to advice advice , says Yahweh , Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ sil@@ os began to hide and ordered the Br@@ other@@ hood of Br@@ other@@ hood basically passed by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ em@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning on his in@@ jur@@ ies .
following a car report , Den@@ g repe@@ ats a ste@@ amer strength of in@@ jur@@ ies to head , trunk and upper th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Sh@@ ic@@ ans of the Br@@ other@@ hood . at least one student dies off the Sch@@ ik@@ anas in 1970 , Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , an att@@ or@@ ney , who joins the family , in a statement .
br@@ other@@ ho@@ ods and their members need to be ac@@ counted for ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step of authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury received an indictment against Mor@@ ning &apos;s third place for the first five members .
two @-@ two members of the br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with ic@@ ac@@ ious attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has b@@ anned the br@@ other@@ hood , and the national br@@ other@@ hood have with@@ drawn their belonging to the village group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest
a interest rate emerg@@ es , and the house is falling in fuel , returns to bonds , and the economy is gle@@ ing into a rec@@ ession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long this will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the story of the economy offers low guidance for the procedure .
a rec@@ ession came out within only 11 months following the first interest of interest and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ sion at the rise of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the economy and financial investments will react .
therefore , Re@@ present@@ atives of the US Central Bank so bad@@ ly emphas@@ ises that investors should not focus on it , but rather it is needed to increase interest rates but rather than for the period , which is required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , at the end , market participants could prove that the whole exc@@ it@@ ement could possibly be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated due to a interest rate .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably interpre@@ ted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; budget money &quot; said , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ kon@@ om in Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest at normal heights , but still on low level , to so@@ is@@ mic shock they seem to end many .
however , this does not mean that it will be no effect .
here is a look at historic trends , like some areas of the economy could respon@@ d :
as the market has seen in the last month , the appreci@@ ation of interest income can make things for a while vol@@ atile .
once the increase takes , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tend@@ ency to reflect properties from 12 to 24 months after the first increase of monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank an@@ alysts in a recent study , which happen to the interest income of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly seen in the up@@ ward trend - approximately 14 per cent - on the road to the interest margin , fairly flat in the 250 days after an actual yield that Bob Doll , chief heads line at Nu@@ ve@@ en As@@ set Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effect on the shares will appear shar@@ ply later in the Hig@@ her cycle and returns the return of returns .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest is often encour@@ aged them .
in the current case the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that could not force before and acceler@@ ate a rec@@ ession .
it is very remarkable that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP increased by 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 came to 3,6 percent , only few shows that this is more re@@ gre@@ t , and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest income in such a frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; if it is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants formed the whole year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week .
while many roads and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC would have an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade will only give a 25 percent chance .
&quot; in our study all the increases cycles from 1950 to date has taken place in a super cycle with increasing weak@@ ening of GDP and in pre @-@ rec@@ ession sh@@ ank very quickly after the start of rest in the sh@@ adows . &quot;
by contrast , this is a clear long recovery from what the worst rec@@ ession was observed in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the strong income was also vol@@ atile , since the market inc@@ ur@@ red a interest margin , and the pattern is fairly similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares , if they change their strategic path .
at bonds , the yield appear to switch as soon as the first increase in cycle is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the cycle , the lei@@ ades shall fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the sur@@ ge@@ ons of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates would result in progress between longer and shorter users and lead to a turn of curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come an@@ alysts at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is , says Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of the inflation pro@@ sper@@ ity , there are some signs that the market adapted to the pro@@ spect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates has increased , the carrying b@@ ends is flat , lending b@@ ag@@ ility has expanded , and the Vol@@ at@@ ility has increased - all characteristics of the market where the F@@ ed has sharpen@@ ed its strategy .
in large and all , companies will wrap up the larger part of their business activities in the United States , when interest rates are rising and attractive local products .
mult@@ in@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts will be worse , as an increasing dollar makes its products more expensive on the global market and equally the financing of their deb@@ ts .
&quot; the history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to be positive , three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s an@@ alysts in a report on customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the income increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yield and low volume finance for their shares also exceed their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts become a big issue .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most likely to say , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock of stock consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers want to see profits by higher yiel@@ ds , even if experts are different according to their opinion , how quickly it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says spokes@@ man Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ized the transmitter due to its &quot; per@@ g@@ ums &quot;
he ar@@ gu@@ ed that he is not to distingu@@ ish increasingly by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aims at the BBC Music Awards and said that she only im@@ it@@ ates The Br@@ its

BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , pro@@ claim@@ ing a guided parliamentary committee and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that do not do the private .
the conserv@@ ative de@@ pu@@ ties Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ independent radio station &quot; mis@@ sil@@ ly &quot; and even more is not to be distingu@@ ished from his commercial compet@@ itors .
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; ver@@ pid &quot; not like it - but it seems to convert to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also went to BBC Music Awards , who launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name .
so if you try to do something else - this is two spont@@ aneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already happening on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC General Director pointed out the alleg@@ ations and argue that BBC Radio 3 goes far from his commercial compet@@ itors , when it comes to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and musicians who really is un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed .
&quot; and the engagement of radio 3 , new music to find and new works on behalf , I really think also for important , &quot; he said .
in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that har@@ der was to be used to eng@@ age the public as it did in the past because the Brit@@ ons are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was however not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media , and sport , is under fire , making commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .

net sales grew in August on the s@@ lower and black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales reinforced three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the black Friday will leave the expenses in November
for more than a decade , virtual shopping is b@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets turned to cl@@ erg@@ y .
however , experts say that the online sales are st@@ agn@@ ating when new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the year 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that online sales are st@@ agn@@ ating when new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG @-@ sale index the Guardian .
he stated that online sales grew up for three years ago , as a purch@@ aser has started import@@ ing their cell@@ phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it p@@ end@@ ure , and we &apos;ll probably experience that growth is reduced .
the black Friday phen@@ omen@@ on that imported from America is quot@@ ed as a reason for the laser @-@ shot sales .
experts believe that the buyer will take place their purchases on this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year Sch@@ oll has five times the average number of buy@@ ers around her computer to make her bar@@ gain , and some dealers origin@@ ated .
experts believe that Black Friday will com@@ end the Bu@@ yer for bar@@ gain , buy@@ ers of it , to take purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium came out that from 5 out of 5 , spending a little more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as TV@@ s and wash@@ ers , more than one third of the purchases must now be carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than one quarter of the humans have bought clothes and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the interior cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca having killed in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Lad@@ ens Family is s@@ ank@@ ed
the bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in the first ret@@ ains in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ mant@@ led the break@@ down in some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden &apos;s huge Saudi Bin Laden .
the Ministry of Health said that altogether , a total of 394 people were in@@ ju@@ red , after the crane g@@ ung@@ es
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves , when 29 of the victims were borne by the streets they were killed , they were killed as a crane to Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ aic .
TRA@@ U@@ ER@@ N@@ DE filled , largely dres@@ sed in white , the route to z@@ ol@@ len as the first of the dead their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m cemetery .
the fun@@ c@@ ession moved to the Holy Sites , where only days had a building crane by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then crashed into the bed .
the bodies were released for the bur@@ ial , when the Saudi King passed over the building of the Bin Laden as a disaster , which was rejected by 394 .
the bodies of 29 be@@ ers , who were killed as a crane by the great central mos@@ aic of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgri@@ mage , was over the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents from the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch .
Saudi @-@ offici@@ als have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca have to become with thousands continue to continue to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden was not supposed to stand the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden was held responsible for collap@@ se .
the English language of the news agency told that this detail , however , said that the company &apos;s guided tour abroad must be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man caused to reve@@ al the crash of the sick , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims fell in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later assembled in this month .
the Bin Laden group did not show any statements about the collap@@ se of cranes and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal decree also acted the group because of not current security measures , because they did not cooper@@ ate with met@@ e@@ olog@@ ists .
do@@ zens of cranes surrounded Mek@@ kas big mos@@ quit@@ os as part of the massive building project , directed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the ruler of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dece@@ ased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden was a tri@@ cky &apos;s son who was able to escape from the family in 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came to a strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgri@@ mage , which is at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
civil servants said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
the government offici@@ als assigned to that 1 million R@@ ial ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the slain , and the same sum for the last ones .
other re@@ ju@@ red receive half of this amount .

hence , King@@ f@@ isher can open to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops which set itself to crafts@@ men and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry spoke to deal with more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchased cho@@ ices in the store are taken by women .
at the moment the men we@@ igh more than the men .
she said it was necessary to establish the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move them into a balance .
as a principle , half of our clients choose women with 80 percent of the decisions as a purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , also has instru@@ cted your top team to reflect a same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 per cent of the team , including its management and finance .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious choice - diversity is an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and par@@ agr@@ aph@@ s after the group charges the cost of stores .
because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new branches .
offici@@ als of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of acc@@ ents
at the Landes@@ gericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday two offici@@ als of the Austrian Play @-@ V@@ iz@@ em@@ e@@ isters A@@ I / DO@@ B have to answer over un@@ fai@@ th@@ ful@@ ness and dis@@ incl@@ usion .
the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with ampl@@ itude .
he was acqu@@ itted of this acc@@ us@@ ement in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney of Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the years 2006 until 2011 , the accused had allowed to dis@@ pon@@ tif@@ y that they were dis@@ pon@@ ing in their functions , for private purposes .
with around 400@@ ,000 euros it is estimated to damage the damage .
the sports activities are also charged with funding .
this fact was the chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ at , judge Michael Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
in the case of Un@@ loy@@ al , the defence case that the association was at no point occurred .
the sport@@ s@@ men would have had only the pen@@ sions of pen@@ sions and the sport@@ sc@@ lub for whom they have been working from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they have invested a lot of time and money , the Pas@@ si@@ va bet@@ ray approximately 600@@ .000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : do we guide the club or bul@@ lock , &quot; he told one of the def@@ endants , during the pre@@ domin@@ ance of financial am@@ ity .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , our life insurance secured as security at the Bank , &quot; he said in response .
unless agreed with the association , you can freely manage the money , it may only be no deb@@ ts .
furthermore , - with the financial success , the payout of the pen@@ sions were retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore one part of the sent@@ ences were only valid years later , namely in 2003 , when an increase on the account was to be paid out .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and non @-@ det@@ a@@ illed entries , the ex @-@ Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ch@@ books managed the two accused , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs have not been exposed in detail , the judge asked .
the association has not been interested in detail for financial support , but not just the freedom of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of € 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association account against the official investig@@ ations .
these were back , the accused were declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known as the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
that didn &apos;t know how long did the answer .
finally , he meant he had believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happened , nobody would have noticed something of that money , the Prosecutor dropped in the room .
the com@@ mander has been informed that just@@ if@@ i@@ ably the offici@@ als .
this transfer has been form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why do claim damage ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ endants declared that this form@@ ulation was not agreed with this form@@ ulation because it never had an damage .
but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; Who are all of the tail@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; I am a legal agent ? &quot; he asked .
he also said the offici@@ als , he never covered a cent sal@@ ary , he merely earned merely mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets to invo@@ ke the association 1,000 euros per month , the actual cost is much higher , added he added .
the def@@ endants were not able to show the def@@ endants in the early years .
these be judged as a working test which had been judged as correc@@ ted , no longer listed .
mil@@ eage was also involved in the second def@@ endants .
all the shall be in cash , with that he must drive from his residence of international understanding of the bank after Ble@@ ib@@ urg , he explained in his testimony .
the trial will continue on 23 September by the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces another 30.000 jobs
in addition to the company for three years , the computer giant will be able to develop further jobs during the division of the company .
the job openings at the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not have an end .
as part of its re@@ structuring the US technology group , the US technology group plans to save 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients .
this will thus be saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euros ) , the company shared on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a off@@ al load of about $ 2.7 billion which will inc@@ ur the fourth quarter .
the development of 55@@ .000 jobs has not been finished for the last three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , hp employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
consequ@@ ently , the Hewlett @-@ Packard share were 2.3 percent after the report .
the head@@ band members of the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto ob@@ sol@@ ete at present : thus the computer and print shop may be bun@@ dl@@ ed in a new company - separate from the future areas of computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ appo@@ inting computer paragraph and a we@@ aker demand of corporate customers after services set up the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo recently .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers went back by 11.5 % .
turnover fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the proce@@ eds were pushed back in 15 of 16 quarters .
hp respon@@ ds with a split and massive job openings for change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded to their smart phones and tablets instead of conventional computers to do more and more shops .
in total , Whit@@ mans re@@ structuring plans take a total of about 55@@ .000 vac@@ anc@@ ies .
conflic@@ ts : majority supports Anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct investment of German soldiers to combat against host@@ ilities in Iraq would like the greater part on ref@@ us@@ al : 54 percent said that by contrast , 35 percent were voted in favour .
in Iraq , other countries against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive .
however , 24 per cent may act in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian rul@@ ers of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad revi@@ ves 51 percent of respon@@ d@@ ents , 20 percent would be .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ ke : viol@@ ent of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has set up the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water host@@ els against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has wit@@ ness@@ ed the break@@ down on the border point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind this , a police line was form@@ ulated and behind the police force there was a water cooler .
40 to 50 Re@@ fuge@@ es began with stones , st@@ aves and plastic bottles following the offici@@ als .
the offici@@ als were initially un@@ interru@@ pted pepper spray .
then the police used the police .
a lot of tr@@ umps was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now wa@@ ited so far .
a we@@ aker and obviously the last woman was taken away from the zone .
children that had met the city of Te@@ ard@@ as , cried .
other refugees packed in themselves together and suffered under breath@@ s .

time of decision on interest rates for US margin
the world ob@@ serves as the U.S. note on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , together to meet the important decision whether the first time has been raised to interest for almost one decade , or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists located by Reuters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was found that the F@@ ed will think that the F@@ ed will continue to wait longer and keep interest rates on the current status of 0 - 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest has been on N@@ ULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a great central bank might leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ aut , leading employees at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ign@@ ore the less raw outlook on global circumstances .
the markets were war@@ ned to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances are good for such a step .
the verdict should be announced at 20.00 a.m. CET on Thursday
killing the death support at the Delta State University
after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues &apos; le@@ id , &quot; he couldn &apos;t make it &quot; le@@ id &quot; , &quot; he could not say it , &quot; gave the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 on mon@@ day morning
and he said , He was shot on someone and someone killed .
Lamb told the staff of not@@ ruf@@ esc@@ ence that police officers appe@@ als to his home .
he said , &quot; I made my wife yesterday evening , &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; should be in the house , but nobody will ru@@ pt it , but he probably will be exc@@ ited . &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police came the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I could do it back .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
following writing of the note , Lamb leaves 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police killed him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he know nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb also believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , I give &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ ck@@ s@@ incl@@ usion . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en that she had married about seven years as a &quot; good man &quot; was described .
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss would have one daughter , the 19 , and it was destroyed by the ground . &quot;
he told that Pr@@ ent@@ iss del@@ ight the daughter &quot; absolute best friends . &quot;
pr@@ un@@ ite worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Kn@@ ow@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kn@@ ow@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss who had a dog called Light@@ ning , had met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; said Kn@@ ow@@ les
the police said , Lamb called his relatives at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; he don &apos;t go into prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen came up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to his foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb obtained a doc@@ torate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University , according to his life of life at the University of the University .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play for months over double freight t@@ inc@@ ture
in the Champions League , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double freight t@@ inc@@ ture in Eindhoven at the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while this left the left idi@@ s to W@@ one and close it for at least six months of play , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give hope that Sha@@ w cannot play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno during the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
it was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said , &quot; He has a double bed and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved on tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United is very difficult and then really playing , and then it happens .
in the changing cab he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor if you have double fre@@ t@@ inc@@ ture then takes the six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the h@@ anger of a El@@ f@@ m .
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the ar@@ b@@ iter , has not pun@@ ished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian ar@@ b@@ iter was mistaken .
they can judge for yourself , if I say that a mis@@ meter and a red card were pr@@ one .
it was a very worst attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how bad I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back again . &quot;
here@@ by related : Manchester United also suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of PS@@ V
with the European Championship , the European Championship in France has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to catch up until the coming June .
Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury to the square , everyone is very sad .
it is never the inten@@ tion of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno was suffered a leg , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his inten@@ tion to hurt his opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad bre@@ ach , it is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u .
it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction on the way , as if he had touched it , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how that feels how hard can be such a thing .
I feel very bad on doing . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - based on a f@@ oul@@ ume by Chris Sm@@ ug@@ i .
surely David knows David Cameron &apos;s Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that will learn all the parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you are , you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book decided to call the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which were created in 1971 , the environmental be@@ ak of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice when Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s always a picture or a message that we have missed a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and well , except for the following paragraph , in the Cameron rep@@ uted the action of the book , instead , a syn@@ dic@@ tion@@ ate of the film version of 2012 will rather be added to extend the new characters and details to be the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a product , ho@@ pes to see a real tree to see a real tree , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Ge@@ is@@ el was , but was completely unknown .
as if that is not yet enough : the text of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presenting itself as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a product , ho@@ pes to win a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he rel@@ ates to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic Father , it seems to be so little familiar to Cameron to act as little as the local environment in spite of prot@@ ests of the well @-@ thought On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the prot@@ ests of the well @-@ like Lor@@ ax , &quot; which speaks in the name of trees , &quot; dev@@ ast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing @-@ street @-@ spokes@@ person told that the text probably came from Camer@@ oon &apos;s Choice Office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but no further notice of direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threat@@ ened by the excl@@ usion of England team , but it is still hard
to get to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if one has selected the head@@ ers that has been selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks page is probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strongly ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een was developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Rash@@ id , even if he is an unknown size on the test plane , is an option for the attack .
this message includes : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the way back from the England Test K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks on difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ players are al@@ igned to the results .
there was no documents in Joe root , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said this before - players are their own best cho@@ ices .
a long time ago I would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny .
if he propos@@ es further races for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ised his post@@ ure , even if he was not so good achie@@ vements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question , how much time a test stro@@ ke@@ man gets to get his sign is difficult .
ly@@ th received seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son got in before him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on got nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only thing which one can rise , was that England first translated Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - but that lost a chance - but that lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es is coming in , and he is a r@@ ammer which I sc@@ oop up high .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we looked at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , who became very soon .
he must receive at least the same chances as they are before him , but this depends on the team of team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to adop@@ t Mo@@ een beside Cook , offering extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four tor@@ icks would give up , and I have nothing in it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can not strike there , and this link has already shown that he is a vic@@ ious gap of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no great difference .
my first team @-@ mate Just@@ in Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the open@@ er in 2001 .
he has g@@ otten off three hundred pounds immediately and did not look back .
Zaf@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the box as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited handling with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
people possibly spot its statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no great number of backup chips that lift up their hands and their coach have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew in England , England made a few small ad@@ ditions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dee , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a master advis@@ or for the test games could be a vic@@ tor .
he is one of the nic@@ est dun@@ ge@@ ons of the game that will bring an abundance of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela it has in@@ sights , of which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously mentioned .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at One @-@ Day@@ ers , Roo@@ t received a similar break for Australia and I have no problem with this .
some are not to agree , but co@@ aches and team control are not the schedule .
and you will need to remember that as with players will dep@@ end their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made by simple hearts .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ going Great Britain from the EU ) could also gain moment@@ um , if the economy has been in the dol@@ drums until 2017
David Camer@@ ons I@@ ran@@ gor@@ od real@@ ization strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU , even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or Tu@@ c , sc@@ attered around Europe on Tuesday .
fore@@ ign@@ ers have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ acy fre@@ ed that some member states are so deeply root@@ ed in different cr@@ ises , such as the EU is now , and not always from their own debt , whol@@ es@@ cal@@ ities , and inter@@ ference changes , which they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Brig@@ h@@ ton , Tu@@ c chose the Tu@@ c in her annual meeting that it also doesn &apos;t like it to end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers must move on summit meetings or bil@@ ateral meetings , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they won allies for re@@ forms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European Friend , who wishes one to the outside of the UK - &quot; Let us not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets slip that more and more brief ministers and offici@@ als have come up to the point that it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
in Germany , c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is one ally , but she will leave the post for 10 years before it is bad for them , as it was bad for them that were ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande is looking back on his re@@ election or its creation in 2017 .
it is also an abandoned force .
Poland may be a nation@@ al@@ istic rights government , Spain is a left .
it falls heavily to imagine that they should help yourself to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better to get out of the UK - something that &apos;s does not want it to do the most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tend@@ encies .
hence , some of such ministers may not be deli@@ ber@@ ately not helpful , at the SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ al campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , probably my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the new negoti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t won any value from the rela@@ unch . &quot;

actually Tony Bla@@ ir are actually thinking about them , but it was certain that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas to make it away , instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ ib@@ and was more bl@@ az@@ ers objec@@ ted as Bla@@ ir , because Bla@@ ir had refused the const@@ itution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened him a back@@ door .
the press has never let him go .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly little fl@@ aps on the back - I told him that he doesn &apos;t seem to be more time for me - seems to repeat anything for me - Ne@@ il Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ doch , a mistake , and today .
it can take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe - I &apos;ll be kind of - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ k@@ ips are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bst@@ one tend@@ ency and the wild geo@@ des of go@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; a Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , was not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was a bad idea of pro@@ vo@@ ke John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler a bad idea .
it remin@@ ds me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father sat on television to be loy@@ al to his Labour @-@ cabinet , without going too far and loose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was still more attractive .
but to fight against &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expressed himself - Benn@@ s expressed - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell did , even what J@@ C told his com@@ ra@@ des and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to mediate - think that he even touched me - Break@@ ing news discipl@@ ine remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding centre of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it is correct to announce a free ticket for Europe who allowed him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ end@@ al campaign for a self @-@ understanding , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell &apos;s things .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins definitely think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns agre@@ es to EU membership - in accordance with her Benn@@ ite Siege economy , its anti @-@ capital@@ ist past - is no longer only a question of es@@ oter@@ ic debate on the left dis@@ sid@@ ents of small sub@@ trac@@ ts a central principle of dog@@ matic dis@@ pute .
as with his am@@ id@@ ality to the N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is fel@@ sen@@ al convinced that J@@ C will not be any campaign to the withdrawal - become foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in everything a sense of its preferred home .
why should Paris or Berlin apply political capital - they have also mis@@ str@@ au@@ ve vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be mean@@ ing@@ less ?
the US has already been dis@@ appointed by weak military performance in Iraq , Libya , and Syria , even with a quot@@ a of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was rem@@ ind@@ ed of a little bit of a somewhat re@@ membr@@ ance of the British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ism report of Public Health England about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tion of a state financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking origin@@ ates from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections for the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined the public health general public in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used by the Public Health Journal .
P@@ he published the &quot; Ele@@ mentary Report &quot; in the past month , and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive revision of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have asked the power rating of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a special feature in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month handle the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate basis &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other re@@ sear@@ cher in BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tion &quot; should be mounted on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , &quot; Professor for Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strateg@@ ies should be based on the proof of effic@@ acy . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that the present best estimate is that E cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement is made up of a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multi @-@ country @-@ making analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinion about the damage of different nic@@ ot@@ ine v@@ ascular products to a syn@@ thesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously given by British American Tob@@ acco ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BAT towards the Public Health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he should have received after reports from the tab@@ ac@@ company Philip Morris International , added .
the reasons for choosing the members of the Gre@@ at@@ ums are not delivered , but this includes several known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify an industrial financing in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the session , the tobacco line of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
no such connections or limit@@ ations in the P@@ he report will be discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that it is no evidence that there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes may not serve as a way for smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
PRO@@ F Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Charity In P@@ he said that had already responded to the asser@@ tion by BM@@ J .
he said , &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life smo@@ ker dies at his Su@@ cht .
all evidence shows that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are compar@@ ing small , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique oblig@@ ation for information about the public about what the proof lies and what is not , especially when it &apos;s so much public confusion about the relative dang@@ ers in comparison to the tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking and smoking costs two billion euros a year .
through the clear advantages of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fr@@ action of damage caused by smoking , we ful@@ fil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give the East@@ en@@ ders , says former chief of Channel 4
the former President of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Riv@@ als would give your right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson told that the radio fee can only be used to make the kind of programs , which are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they are probably seen public @-@ legal programs that probably will probably be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al time window with the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and by stations like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson that he tried to get into contact with the BBC in his time for six years .
&quot; I &apos;ve got problems with the idea that BBC programs would be on behalf , which also clearly shows of not sub@@ vention@@ ised ri@@ val , &quot; said Johnson to the top@@ haus communication committee in the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you would like to hold the radio fee , what I &apos;m not in the long term not for a good idea , you should not make his production at least on programs that do not work or on behalf .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class schedule because they want to achieve a broad range of support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , of course it is non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why an ar@@ res@@ sive tax programs is financed , which could be funded without sub@@ si@@ dies .
the Voice is a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ tedly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I want to see me how to be open@@ ly public TV .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entre@@ pren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC exc@@ use on the hunting . reviews , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments to the most popular ship@@ ments of BBC will give again what was the former Director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart @-@ Speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows could sell as a East@@ en@@ ders .
Johnson told that the rather publicly @-@ legal N@@ ic programs &quot; to B@@ BC@@ 4 should be where you can &apos;t want to measure your tasks , but they can argue that they have not created all these ob@@ sc@@ riptions , &quot; Now , of course , we have seen all those above mentioned programs . &quot;
they put them into a time window in which nobody wanted to see them .
in this radio charge , Johnson reported to the Committee : &quot; I need to find a rather exciting system regarding terms of conditions who can obtain the best value .
of course , all of you think that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is true for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 Chef David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC will ver@@ ify its Re@@ ith@@ ian mission to form and stop . &quot;
he said , only a little out of the BBC &apos;s production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % of radio stations in Australia and Canada , and they should change an example in &quot; inform , clar@@ ify and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of the Partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment in which they will be radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pul@@ ses .
scientists have bo@@ xed wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified ner@@ vous system that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .

the researchers said , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new process called son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , where ultr@@ as@@ ound , to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells out of the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California said to replace the process of a day the deep stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asive procedure which gives electric im@@ pul@@ ses into the brain of people for tre@@ ating the symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .

the bu@@ bbles , found it out , strength@@ ening the ultr@@ as@@ ound wave , then penet@@ rate the wor@@ ms .
the more ultr@@ as@@ ound waves act on structures , which are called the T@@ RP @-@ 4 I@@ onic channels and will be found in mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the di@@ gn@@ osis .
the sound waves act the aperture of these I@@ onic channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report of Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound tr@@ n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , the Chal@@ de@@ ani &apos;s gene@@ tically modified wor@@ ms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ onen T@@ RP @-@ 4 needs var@@ ic@@ onic channels .
when ultr@@ as@@ ound to the changed cre@@ atures , the sound waves are amp@@ lified by the micro@@ ves@@ ic@@ les and transm@@ its it into wor@@ ms where it turned the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ onen .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , one gro@@ und@@ breaking tool , the scientist allows , ne@@ ur@@ ons with im@@ pul@@ ses of light and dis@@ advantage .

eight golden rules for life in students
eleven years ago , as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ali Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the under@@ lying smile of those who I have an@@ no@@ yed - and on the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most , what I have learned , can dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the residence in student residence extends from lightly ner@@ ve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolute sc@@ ary .
it is tem@@ pt@@ ing to sw@@ ing@@ ing : people tell wh@@ ence com@@ est , wher@@ ever you are taking the Sabbath year , and why you &apos;re sin@@ c@@ ere with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you &apos;re &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly said MAR@@ M@@ ITE there is only one He@@ fe@@ extra@@ kt h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ a@@ the through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
the conversation , and helps you to find people out what they might say in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes would fail in fire and this fire ext@@ ingu@@ isher would be .
allow people to do .
the rooms of people are often converting into be@@ verage recipes , film @-@ night event venues and municipal meeting , but they are also the places where people dance and their under@@ wear .
here@@ by : do not think about the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough handling at the university .
their room should be a Ref@@ ug@@ ium , but lots of student residence form a room @-@ to @-@ space @-@ bo@@ unc@@ ing culture , the friendly and soci@@ ally can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this may be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I will know that our friendship goes on , but you must go away , that I have consumed the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
just try to feel when a Com@@ mil@@ it@@ ress of hy@@ mn is exhau@@ sted - and send an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
speaking of ank@@ ind : do it .
a guy in my students had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with Baking .
as you start the university on the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of mankind to present themselves with a plate of bro@@ wn@@ ies , less strange than the welcome when I smile . so , and now please smile if I give you a few personal questions . &quot;
to offer homemade tre@@ ats is a good way to close friends .
your fel@@ lows are committed to enter@@ tain himself and will associ@@ ate your face with a tasty surprise at the end .
of course , this depends whether you are a permanent b@@ aker .
bad conf@@ id@@ ated cl@@ ump out of flour , sugar and fat make sure people sit down when you arrived .
food to ste@@ al is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the cri@@ b of chicken is a the@@ ft , but is it a drop of mil@@ ing for your tea ?
check this with the owner of milk .
the chances are good to let them say , even if they cook inside the inner .
if anyone ste@@ el@@ ts your stuff , it is an@@ no@@ ying , and you got my symp@@ athy - but try to go well @-@ balanced than my fellow worker , added to her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to prevent the@@ ft .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise , which holds people from sleep or from working .
not only is a de@@ cent man to be a permanent man , but that you belong to the true sense of saying that sitting in glass .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neigh@@ b@@ ors if it gives them something , drum &amp; bass something quiet , because it had three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they acted on it with more loud music .
when she finished her neigh@@ bor at 5 o &apos;clock , she sent her neigh@@ bour for two hours before they left their own music , ended up their doors and beg@@ ged her three hour after it .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic , if your future spouse would be random@@ ly drawn into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be pro@@ found@@ ly embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ed if you have to dis@@ connect her to her future wife , to dis@@ connect yourself and perhaps to do every day , how they all shared their friends to himself ?
of course the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow owner is definitely not your future wife , try at least to talk to your under@@ wear a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has not allowed his key in his not closed room , the border is between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ one as it seems .
a good Stre@@ ich is funny , but it takes only moments until it gets bo@@ omer@@ ang .
do not share valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never reconc@@ ile someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but do not break their sett@@ le@@ ments on the ceiling more than twice .
rac@@ ed houses for refugees , single feeding , straight operators
the Real Estate entre@@ pren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is located in the middle @-@ fr@@ ater@@ nal corner house for people who do not have much money .
so for refugees - but as a signal too : &quot; not only refugees need bar@@ gain , but also alone the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ tem@@ par@@ er . &quot;
&quot; I show how you can still rely and well , &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are mig@@ rated to the housing market .
the entre@@ pren@@ eurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner Belie@@ ve to know how quickly your living space can be created : it builds on a project @-@ ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the money market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass@@ es of mass@@ es in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
given the refuge@@ e stream , we also need sufficient hab@@ itat in the next few decades .
a completely ban@@ en@@ y , three @-@ storey building house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : one ter@@ rac@@ ed house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different if you teach people in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are built straight in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees can say , it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt after the specific needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space is 184 000 euros , without a property .
that is clear .
the construction lasted six months .
it is adequate .
have construction regulations necessary their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have established my project correctly .
it is especially complicated , making the dro@@ h@@ itting di@@ amo@@ is worth special and the space placement .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three locations .
only in the cities there is no place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did local people react to their Sem@@ i @-@ detached project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : in which , they were accused of creating luxury cars for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely does not vote .
but do not b@@ other the competition struggle for paying dwell@@ ings ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : this is true : we had a boom in Germany in the last five years but build luxury apartments that can hardly accompl@@ ish any more .
my project has the message , also normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also alone the mother or of the Ger@@ ing@@ ray .
I show how you can still rely and well built in today .
so it is about that .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone operating system when Apple releases will be released
the new operating system can be requested by select &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , you can download the phone to download and install it .
some are exposed to the installation of problems , since they receive an error message that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to walk the problem , users are advised to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght is back or try to update iTunes to update .
the telephone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
it may possibly mean the del@@ e@@ tion of Apps , but Apple has done through the updates of updates . however , it will be easier to delete it if you have a special tool to install apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is finished .
it pays to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charging station , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , as the phone may stop hal@@ f@@ way and could lead to a break@@ down of the updates .

it was symp@@ athy for the first sight when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll has decided to take care of her speci@@ alty training in the collabor@@ ative hospital and comm@@ ented them in practice as well .
&quot; we had always seen in mind that the gar@@ bage would be going well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship and lau@@ gh .
&quot; as it was so far , I simply called her . &quot;
the couple Müller was pleased the idea of having his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact of the patients are very attractive , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to meet and ac@@ company the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he can also be his own b@@ oss .
and so , the gar@@ bage can be bought up the house with practice .
they are still living in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is the two father @-@ house father Frank Müller also grew up , in his physician at Hannover , followed by stations in several physician offices and in the hosp@@ itals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .

the gar@@ bage , both dorm@@ ists , want to be classified as household in@@ aries .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound testing as well as long @-@ term and intensity EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of 500@@ 00 Euro will be given the gar@@ bage in the frame of a belt from the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality of the village ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are continuing to continue practice , &quot; emphas@@ izes sam@@ t@@ non@@ smo@@ ker Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients come in practice , in practice , in the northern German average practice it takes approximately 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another house practice .
Frank Müller remains a positive side effect by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in As@@ endorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship .
if no sequ@@ el could be found , it would be gone .
who is said to be visited , even above all in tru@@ sted faces : the seven medical specialist and the cleaning capacity takes over the rim .
with their leave in As@@ endorf a era , the Medi@@ c@@ iner after 30 years has practic@@ ed there .
&quot; at the beginning we had just two rooms , &quot; remember Ur@@ sel rim breaks .
little W@@ ehm@@ ut sp@@ lin@@ ure them after the long time .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or , and many patients are often seen , &quot; says the boarding .
her husband comple@@ mented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always expressed myself with gar@@ den@@ ing work , now it could be different . &quot;
the couple has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are appro@@ ached upon our southern border , &quot; Minister of Conduc@@ tor Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
the controls at the Hungarian border will be kept in parallel .
according to what is clear that everybody wants to put political asylum , of course , &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and security of people standing in the fore@@ ground .
it was clear , however , &quot; that it &apos;s clear signals , &quot; the prime minister said .
people need to know that we cannot accept limit@@ less migration rates , not even above the Austrian Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia won &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ unded
the Croatian government had previously commun@@ icated , Slovenia would continue to fer@@ ment for gr@@ asp@@ ing refugees in Austria and Germany under circumstances and also cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar looked not , however , at La@@ ib@@ ach , however .
the idea of cor@@ ridor is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather inten@@ si@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - inten@@ si@@ fy .
the border with Croatia is as the outer border of the Sch@@ engen area by contrast , however , is strongly controlled .
as the min@@ istri@@ es st@@ ressed , Sloven@@ ians would not make its limits for refugees but not abri@@ d@@ dling .
&quot; each EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; emphas@@ ized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar .
like the Croatian government , they would have tried to pass the first refugees in the night of the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to pass the registration in Ost@@ k@@ ola in order to obtain the registration .
the Croatian police found them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police have been constantly hit with new refugees .
it is pre@@ domin@@ antly about Sy@@ rer and Afghanistan , among them numerous women and children .
rescue service and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , they expect approximately 4,000 refugees , the Minister of Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would also be linked to the Hungarian Serbian border so far reported to mig@@ rants to Hungary , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
but the government in Belgrade would prove that they should say to humans , certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we do that . &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian Border town of S@@ id , during the day , more buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the ins@@ ur@@ ants were on the road that the entire night was about 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Sea .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has said , so the cop@@ s told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany in Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus , it actually could have already predic@@ ted the previous shif@@ ting of the hi@@ ther@@ to route Turkey to Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a bit further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive cap@@ abilities to check@@ point control &quot;
Croatian Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously st@@ ressed that his country has prepared plans for the case of a strong condition of refugees prepared adequate plans for possible activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lead str@@ ing@@ ent control to qualify for membership in the room .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently put a good witness over the land , which concerns the standard of the border controls .
on a Serbian website , some 300 refugees continue to hold them on a Hungarian border .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports they have spent the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border controls H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain fully blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to reach the Croatian border , still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was still trying to re@@ ass@@ ure in a local instant : he keep the deb@@ ates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it wouldn &apos;t matter for a very high refuge@@ e rate .
you can &apos;t say whether they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers rates of mig@@ rants - haz@@ ardous - Alternative items
however , private Hungarian Re@@ fuge@@ es have already begun to distri@@ bute to the refugees &apos;s maps , on which alternative rout@@ ines are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ safe : in parts of the border region there are still 20 years after the end of Croatia , still no cle@@ ared min@@ ef@@ iel@@ ds .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ef@@ eller was sent to the border region .

&quot; it &apos;s all about life , therefore we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the leaders of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ itals stand for questions and talks at disposal as the volunte@@ er staff .
while some is a passage from spont@@ aneous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the camper through the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t remain long , read phr@@ ases like &quot; so far I &apos;m not &quot; and go on . &quot;

Fed@@ Ex sum mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lower@@ ed
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant showed his profit review to a whole year due to the we@@ aker demand for freight service and higher costs in its soil service .
the firm also said that she plans to hire approximately 55@@ .000 seas@@ onal worker for the holidays .
this time , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seas@@ onal fore@@ ers for the holiday time last year .
the share fell by more than 2.5 percent in Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. said an gain between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,90 $ in the financial year to earn 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
an@@ alysts anticip@@ ated a survey of $ 10,@@ 84 according to a survey .
the lower viewing comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.9 percent and on 4 January and despite higher supplements for soil transport by heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said that it is still waiting to increase the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will bring a solid income when compared to the expected economic conditions , mainly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ational jobs have been announced one day later than the ri@@ val UPS announced plans to introduce 90@@ ,000 to 95@@ ,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 692 million ended up 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks investment research inqu@@ ired prior to an@@ alysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked the an@@ alysts expected to be 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ Ex paid a decline in international pri@@ or@@ ities for the last few years , where sales were st@@ agn@@ ated in his unit Express shipping .
but the boom in the online shopping has improved the results from Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales of soil transport increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit recorded higher prices due to higher prices , while the result down because of higher labor costs in freight business .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 % , to $ 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on her most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days a week round about a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since nearly a decade to raise the p@@ inion .
in@@ coming from them at an end of the ornam@@ ented , two storey sitting room is located a wall picture of the United States .
the map is a reminder that F@@ ed Ch@@ air@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and their colleagues draw the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from the congress to maxim@@ ize U.S. employment and prices here .
but since the great rec@@ ession has acknowle@@ dged the F@@ ed leader , it &apos;s a very third and third client : financial stability .
and this third party , the X @-@ factor might be pron@@ oun@@ ced in a decision to pre@@ di@@ ct that the US economy is ready to be ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that they are sturdy , the youngest tur@@ bul@@ ence could aff@@ ir@@ m the global financial markets , these Vol@@ at@@ ility might gain moment@@ um by raising the rate of interest for federal debt - and be only by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing which you observe &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Che@@ f@@ economics at the Mak@@ ler@@ s@@ company S@@ tif@@ el Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us what the F@@ ed will do , which is un@@ sec@@ ures to itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , who had been question@@ ed about recently , have pre@@ ju@@ red a interest rate this week .
however , financial markets are exp@@ ecting a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ative that indicates only a 30 % chance .
this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the shr@@ ub blo@@ ws the blow , by promise that another boost is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average returns at 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or at 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was trig@@ gered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy advis@@ es the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ kon@@ om , Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sent@@ ences at that time , &quot; he said .
if it does , &quot; it would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets , so that they do not work in pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts arg@@ um@@ ented that a interest rate would so@@ othing the financial markets , because they will take the un@@ certain@@ ty when the F@@ ed will take effect .
even before a month the F@@ ed seemed to increase the pro@@ position by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow closure of the mon@@ et@@ ric conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ elles had said in Spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the pro@@ position .
although the creation of job positions in August , the improvement of labour market was soli@@ dly built in this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the levels , which the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation was kept under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ ative said , said that the main reason is the temporary effect of substantially lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ kon@@ om said to Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ in .
but financial markets in the world went to the end of last month after China had recycled its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % among its highest level when invest@@ ing was causing a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy .
the market has recovered something in this month , where@@ by the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the high amount of May .
the F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ atives influences the market tur@@ bul@@ ence , the complex calculation when you raise the interest .
&quot; if the events have not occurred on the financial markets and the news on the weak@@ ness of the Chinese economy , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee at the US margin .
now he tells us to wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the global economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the final effect the F@@ ed currency authority is the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous throughout the past few years .
the mere opinion of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ ward in 2013 that F@@ ed its monetary expansion &quot; would like to do their monetary expansion &quot; by the globe .
in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies of econom@@ ies , they can expect from the F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ atives , it will not only advise the developments in other locations , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of global economy .
her decision @-@ making is more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , leader of the global strategy for asset management company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of trans@@ actions on financial market movements , which are not associated with the economic fundam@@ ent@@ alist data . &quot;
L@@ acker , right @-@ leg@@ itim@@ ate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , op@@ posed for a interest rate , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their Le@@ itz@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limit@@ ated meas@@ ur@@ able impact on growth in the US . &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later the F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ atives make these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only make aspects of financial stability within a severe crisis as the market leader in 2008 said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the committee of interest at the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ bul@@ ence come near this plane , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mand@@ ate and does not rule the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should be pre@@ dominant in time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : minor relief for refugees
more refugees come in Germany for ever more refugees .
a warm welcome to prepare , does not work without the dedication of inn@@ umer@@ able volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a whole bunch of people who support un@@ matched asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them Petra and Klaus Heine belong to them .
Petra Heine is with her body and soul teacher .
she still spe@@ e@@ ches with her 74 Len@@ zen still .

Rio Grande Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S attemp@@ ts to clar@@ ify it , how important good diet during bre@@ ast@@ feeding is . she does with the presentation of pictures of babies that are su@@ cking in breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , f@@ ats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies give all nutrients that need to build a powerful immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , flu@@ ctu@@ ate and young moth@@ ers are t@@ ack@@ led to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adjustment which should make the moth@@ ers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women affects the gen@@ es of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
sad@@ ly , a healthy diet of the child may influence the immune system .
excep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ ve Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ese community approved the board instruction for the 2.3 million euros in the gym .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar system .
the planning for long @-@ year@@ ning building on the Bern@@ stor@@ z sports grounds are step ahead : in the recent community meeting , the worked construction has been soci@@ able without a great discussion .
the Panel had previously approved an application for an exclusive &quot; ex@@ emp@@ tive &quot; ex@@ emp@@ tive &quot; ex@@ emp@@ tion &quot; from the valid building plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; went to permission to form a special form on the roof .
this is to be built with a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ mit@@ ig@@ ent first and roof top . &quot;
in the background of the planning , the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; as a result we get a wonder@@ fully big south @-@ roof , &quot; stated may@@ or Josef Steig@@ en@@ berger in the session .
at the Liber@@ ation Camp , it again went around the roof disease , en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing from en@@ ergetic reasons - different than in the development plan - should be below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is considerably reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not require &quot; excep@@ tions &quot; - where@@ by the Bern@@ ace of the council in general proce@@ eds rather restri@@ c@@ tive .
however , this is not a rec@@ ur@@ ring project : &quot; we thus does not create a prec@@ ed@@ ent case , &quot; says Steig@@ en@@ berger .
the hall@@ way building at the Sports Centre is a community project of the community and SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
sub@@ si@@ dies are expected by school and lat@@ itude .
in the next case of proce@@ eding the building instruction for the 18 x 36 meters hall is now presented to the Council office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed as planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new physician at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of associates move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this will see the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the District of Land@@ ing , Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White confirmed .
this decision , however , is the Supervisory Board and ch@@ asing it to be on Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans are to be implemented , all the nearly 50 employees were going to be in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be sol@@ dered by fisher@@ men and the continued access to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in We@@ il@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner &apos;s White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the director has raised the notice of Dr. Andreas E@@ der who is only since the beginning of the trial of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic now and has now been working in a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
according to Jo@@ chner &apos;s question , who will take up , came to Jo@@ chner &apos;s name , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; to the game , who claimed to take over leadership of taking the direction from October 1 , and with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
in each case the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au means this in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wid@@ ening of the offer within the section &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; as Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is speci@@ alised at the inside station on hosp@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schafts Hospital , which has 35 beds in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should finally be closed after almost 140 years .
the local district planned for the year 2018 , when the current restoration is completed at the We@@ il@@ heim hospital .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Jo@@ chner has also succeeded , which is also chairman of the super@@ visory council , which is located in the pos@@ session of the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schafts Hospital , in the pos@@ session of the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schafts Hospital , will be used as a shelter for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I too close it . &quot; as it continues with the property , Jo@@ chner &apos;s white could not say , it may give several refle@@ ctions .
currently there are a short term care of car@@ itas and a day@@ time psych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , where fisher@@ men has been working as chief far@@ ts for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was threat@@ ened by closing of closing , dep@@ artments were closed , for instance , surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

refugees need accommodation : trial war@@ ns about business
the location on the German residential market is ten@@ se .
also more refugees seek a paid b@@ lei@@ ades .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution strug@@ gles in the German residential market has long since begun .
with the upcoming refugees and research seeking out of the EU , more people are in a market that is now over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they are comp@@ eting with income citizens to pay the last paid apartments .
to cover the demand for affordable housing you would have to produce 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
this is a study on behalf of the association &apos;s association &quot; Social Housing . &quot;
for comparison : 26@@ 0,000 units are finished this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments missing .
refugees are no longer required for the first three months of their stay , to live asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ stay accommodation .
many kno@@ cked on the housing market and lined up in the long sn@@ akes in front of the rental apartments .
according to Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the business market is not only in the rising refuge@@ e .
the study also makes considerable con@@ exp@@ ul@@ sions in the residential building policy of the past few years .
Germany will be a business defic@@ it in front of itself , which is bigger from year to year .
currently in the metro@@ politan areas , approximately 77@@ 0,000 residential units were lack@@ ed by Matthias Günther , author of the study .
a lot of professionals therefore lived in major cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market .
in the large cities the number of square metres per capita increased again in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing &quot; propos@@ es a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ en@@ tives are due to boost the social housing back .
this could be consumed on the under@@ going tax and the basic tax of subsidi@@ zed apartments may be suspended .
in addition , according to the alliance , tax @-@ depreci@@ ation and am@@ ort@@ isation is necessary .
the programme for refuge@@ e workshops of the Kf@@ W Kf@@ W is now doing well in cities and municip@@ alities .
a good week after the start was posted on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the costs available at around 300 million euros .
now the project could be increased even .
refugees have free jel@@ lies : Croatia and Slovenia judge one Cor@@ ridor
after Hungary is virtually no more go through , since then there are more refugees the way about Croatia .
Zagreb , we pro@@ claim the transit of Slovenia to the north without leaving the hur@@ dles .
but the route is nevertheless dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbor@@ ing Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Justice , and when necessary , we will organ@@ ise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Sch@@ engen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not a Sch@@ engen country .
after isolation of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Europe from there to western Europe .
500 people have come on the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television broad@@ casting was reported .
Hungary was sealed off his border for refugees at the V@@ ort@@ ag .
new laws that occurred on the same day , make the ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually un@@ necessary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic said : &quot; You can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
however , people don &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police had attacked the first refugees on the Serbian border to Croatia .
most of the two media reports according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and with taxes in the Serbian Border town of S@@ id .
immediately after arrival , they could have tried to arrive on foot across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian Serbian border the refugees won &apos;t reach Gren@@ zz@@ ä@@ une .
there are other dang@@ ers to the border : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v Civil War in the 1990s .
Min@@ ef@@ lu@@ er should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , barely any refugees escap@@ ed after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted for 366 .
just before f@@ usion on Monday we had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws apply the conqu@@ ering and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as an off@@ ence .
therefore , in the southern Hungarian border of Sze@@ ged , 35 criminal cases were initiated .
convic@@ ted thre@@ ats of arrest up to five years and de@@ port@@ ation from the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authorities , a total of 94 political asylum claims were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ons &apos; in total , of which almost all - 93 - am the most important transition r@@ ös@@ ke .
among the applic@@ ant 13 families with young children and two older people are .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had still acc@@ ust@@ om@@ ed there .
however no one has no longer a view of granted asylum in Hungary .
following Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the asylum seek@@ ers should go down there .
in front of the &quot; Tran@@ se@@ zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ ke workers began to make workers un@@ tie .
they collected the b@@ ish , tens of thousands of people in the past weeks left at the road@@ side .
rat@@ chet gr@@ ille were dis@@ mant@@ led and one of the capture records were converted into the bound@@ ary .
no one wanted to express this conversion .
after the closing time of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees can be removed .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but for the 20,000 mig@@ rants , the immig@@ rants still held in the country .
in Salzburg there are about 1400 people waiting for the continuing passing to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ ass@@ ing there are regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of the &quot; bor@@ dered &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge Festival on Sunday , when ten people stood with trav@@ eller at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said Wer@@ n@@ st@@ one may@@ or Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to Passau with the train to Passau .
because in Germany on Sunday , because of the refuge@@ e stream , the railway service was surprising in Austria for them in Wer@@ n@@ stein , who immediately calls his help with two other hel@@ pers and their cars along the border to the near Passau .
first , we had the un@@ ho@@ ped party only once to@@ pped , with lunch and drink .
we have said , we will bring them to Passau with the car .
&quot; this was self @-@ evi@@ dent for us , &quot; as Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very gr@@ ate@@ ful .
a man made it not to give a donation to a donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this was very pleased , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in Wels came to Germany on Sunday evening in Wels by a ICE in a regional train to Passau , shortly after the short term pro@@ cl@@ amation , the rail traffic was stopped to Germany after the short term .
the local train was placed at the Inn near Wer@@ n@@ stein at Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein , the crossing takes over high in the course .
the bridge firm@@ ly linked to the b@@ av@@ arian neigh@@ b@@ ors on Sunday , previously a zoo @-@ bridge is organised by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án can now send to us further Zig@@ es to us , is a logical result of a se@@ em@@ ous policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ ke immediately upon the er@@ ection of structures , our ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or has been highly qualified and publicly dis@@ posed on the attitude of Hungarian government in the National Soci@@ alism .
Le@@ id@@ trag@@ ende of this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now con@@ fron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
even the flies have to be deb@@ ated that the &quot; yellow country , &quot; which they are invited and welcomed us , nothing but another refuge@@ e camp .
it will be a major challenge , in light of the pro@@ long@@ ed refugees and the coming winter , to produce de@@ cent assign@@ ments for gu@@ inea p@@ ants .
and there will be even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search of 3@@ 5,000 win@@ nings in winter
Konrad has full of hands to do with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is usual that his word has weight .
the government has used the former Raiffeisen Bank of Raiffeisen Bank to provide lo@@ dg@@ ings for tens of thousands of refugees .
the chaos is already in the first prize centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen to Konrad already in the grip .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
also the lodging of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday had been without big ver@@ te@@ bel , said Konrad and pra@@ ised the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ piece . &quot;
by contrast to the Ministry of the Interior &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad achieves a total demand of 85@@ .000 pieces in the fier@@ y year .
to ful@@ fil the number , you need to be found 3@@ 5,000 units in the next weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide the countries in the next few weeks .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; Konrad .
he has already conducted interviews with the state of the country .
these could have been awarded to him , even for the upcoming refugees Lo@@ dg@@ ings .
&quot; in Upper Austria she works well , &quot; said Ferry Maier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar assist@@ ed Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to be clar@@ ified as the Church will help .
great expect@@ ation places the asylum coordinates to the ORF Action &quot; Hel@@ fen as we . &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can offer simple accommodations .
it is also ho@@ ping to stand on hotels that are empty in the winter .
Konrad and Maier critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in note , it could not be that Quarti@@ er@@ makers must have a certain height of the towel or size of the finishing .
for a temporary period &quot; security standards must apply . &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior of the Interior , Konrad was founded in Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ le@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without any other in the face .
belief is his main weapon .
Konrad and Maier does not cause the republic to explain how they themselves declared .
their number of employees want to increase it to three to four .
the new lo@@ dg@@ ings had not yet been successfully implemented .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the ste@@ ph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .

not an opening of urban sp@@ urs and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the housing of refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is not necessary not necessary to study those who are currently under these measures , says may@@ or Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
other locations are to be checked for emergency respon@@ si@@ bilities for emergency .
crit@@ ics acts the city chief in the division of refugees within the Federal Republic of Germany .
other distri@@ cts must also make their contribution .
See@@ hofer : &quot; Bor@@ ders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) took part in the refuge@@ e question on Monday .
See@@ hofer is as@@ sured by me that the German borders are not sealed .
the re@@ treat of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
but I also give the respective limit control .
special trains with refugees from Germany will not give it any more .
however , the test results would be brought to Germany with regular breeding .
of the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger asked for more increased solidarity in the refuge@@ e issue .
in fact , Austria can now inspec@@ t in Austria to its limits , for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; a logical consequ@@ ence &quot; from the Pre@@ sidency of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the General renovation of the &quot; New ship@@ yard in the German industrial zone is officially closed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T , the rema@@ inder ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented out for young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , the heads of heads are our raw material - and we need to work that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ hauser .
he could imagine to invest in the Start@@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard , and later also to ac@@ qu@@ iri@@ a .
from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooper@@ ate with the new neighbo@@ urs - including Nieder@@ hauser is promising : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is managed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the top square meters of the apartment in the building are already le@@ ased , for further 40 percent to give inqu@@ iries .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags stand at the center .
she actually wanted to add a dog for Jutta Bre@@ it .
this project had to lift up the 49 year old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she now has offspring in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop towards the business in which they sold under other bags , suit@@ case , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , now everything is about to have ling@@ erie hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , Geld@@ macher will have from 75 Euro .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks has been rebuilt .
&quot; I have covered a long way , if I want to open a shop , &quot; says U@@ it .
decisive for the decision was among others that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own site to which only her hand@@ bags were sold , were cloth@@ ed .
&quot; we are the only one in the region of Linz , which sell these brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has Italian roots .
her fashion interest has given a break from her mother to cra@@ dle .
me di@@ pping on the most , when something evol@@ ves and I can show new trends for competitive prices .
why some woman with a view of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ ents , can also respon@@ d to the skilled woman with last security .
maybe it &apos;s worth a beautiful bag of every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancest@@ ors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants must be called .
this property also connects people with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president will want .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is good for off@@ ender .
whether he declar@@ es strange host@@ ile , journalists touched or lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US President are growing strongly .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the pe@@ p@@ ian K@@ all@@ city , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate of billi@@ ards are ro@@ aming .
the New Yorker with the f@@ ond@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept of many in the wine village on the Wine Road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 population is related to about -@@ zig corners with it .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the Simone Wen@@ del turned into a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his destination , m@@ igh@@ ti@@ est man of the world ?
&quot; I believe that you will find somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter style you are not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ judge has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous Spr@@ inkl@@ es , among which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes into &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) as well as the saying that he would surely be successful if he would surely live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
to give it respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also , the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
acc@@ ident@@ ally the nick@@ name se@@ ized the nick@@ name , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ quality : the show , says she .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the show .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold gr@@ ats .
found@@ ations of the Real Estate Group were first basic shopping in New York .
but life of the grand@@ parents was not free of trag@@ edy : her wish to return to a long time in the Bavarian State , at that the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not res@@ ume Tr@@ ump , because he once was without homologation , the director of the Institute for Pe@@ ac@@ ian History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was explained to the movie start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ child of a &quot; illegal immig@@ ration . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ating statements of the desc@@ endants .
he repeat@@ edly talked about Mexican immer@@ sion in the US and asked the construction of a bound@@ ary about illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the pol@@ led , it is not that sym@@ pa@@ thetic , &quot; Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a dist@@ ant relative m@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , who was a born Heinz . &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ aker in reti@@ rement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so exciting . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the student works Veronika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as a man@@ cher K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit to the church organ ended , which generally accepted well .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine the rema@@ inder of the Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they are better if he cannot ign@@ ore the choice because &quot; it has such radi@@ cal views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who had been in the US at the time of his grand@@ father , as he would have , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than it , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ver Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; my President is not &quot; it says , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are cut rip@@ e without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;

Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson to Can@@ ber@@ ra , in order to report to the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shif@@ ts in the ratings for Today .

today , a slight increase from the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in the last few months the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed .
in August Today he reached the average of 318@@ ,000 compared to the 330@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34,@@ 000 spect@@ ators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting what has happened every morning .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose ?
secret unve@@ ils ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly did not know who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the standing start of Sam Wood in The Bachelor , has been wrapped in secret maint@@ aining .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be in@@ expensive if she is the one who received the last rose .
but as we went to Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three two , you may be acc@@ ident@@ ally given a hint , who will be the winner in .
Sam Wood holds his lips to the final on Thursday .
all three women have left in a ly@@ rical fashion , why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is question@@ ed &quot; If not you , who should receive the last Rose &quot; thing , &quot; could their answers have won to play , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s heart .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki named both fast - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had one relationship with one relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house , and I saw SA@@ MS energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands at the two feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be together with her , added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believed that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the last week you made that Wood &quot; can be &quot; One &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I looked at him with my friends and the family , I was clear that this obviously not just a game - I &apos;m already stopped waiting for him , &quot; she said .
and when she asked for whom he should choose Wood if not her , she was mysterious .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girl al@@ ike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten hours on Wednesday , 19 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent according to an impressive open day of training at the end of last year requests .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and train@@ ers Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a big decision .
some train@@ ers could have been ban@@ ished for the rest of the game to the bank , when he lost one straight , as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by division &apos;s victory in his first p@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula tru@@ sted his husband and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return and also in the ongoing game after a viol@@ ation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the changing cab after the game .
rather than his ro@@ ok@@ ies to gr@@ ind the rema@@ inder of the team by the mill , he encour@@ aged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also managed to find Hay@@ ne publicly in its press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encour@@ aged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y , who ri@@ ves to forget his stun@@ ned catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched in a p@@ unt which was restored in the first quarter of the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings in the first quarter .
it certainly was not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian us@@ ability for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left his playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble cur@@ ing the playing field and told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing , which now comes to it , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne with@@ drew the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport led in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .

Google k@@ icks off the campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double @-@ double @-@ donation campaign to help the thousands of refugees to help thousands of refugees who are over@@ rolled out of the United Nations because they flee from war t@@ orn and po@@ ver@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach with the announcement of the donations @-@ call on his blog .
instead of a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google assistant , who fled to her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , her personal experiences .
&quot; during our trip , many dark railway and coach tours , h@@ unger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them .
I was lucky .
but since the refuge@@ e and mig@@ rant crisis has grown in Europe , many people want des@@ per@@ ate how my family des@@ per@@ ate to help .
donations will provide four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and mig@@ rants ; doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Com@@ mission@@ er for Re@@ fuge@@ es .
Google said that the first raised donations will double up to $ 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / refuge@@ e explosion on 11 million $ .
Europe has con@@ fron@@ ted with its worst refuge@@ e crisis since WW@@ II , largely created through the four years of civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .

for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people suffering from diabetes after weight loss surgery more than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of losing weight loss Surgery , which wrote a feature of the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss of weight or ob@@ es@@ ity surgery , use various methods to zoom out the size of the stomach .
they reduce h@@ unger and limit the physical ability to consume food .
over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ Oper@@ ations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been proved effective , but most studies have been performed with a Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BMI of over 30 apply as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI with your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which has been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of ob@@ es@@ ity surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ypass and Mag@@ en@@ schl@@ ager - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BMI of those who under@@ went surgery from 31 to 24.@@ 5 till the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI is not one of the non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among the survi@@ ving surgical procedure , the diabetes disease did completely dissolved in 36 % and with 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes is fully affected by only one percent and partially with only about two percent .
in addition , results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ides and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL chol@@ ester@@ ol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; were the authors found out .
the researchers have also reflected the patients blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which reflec@@ ts the blood glucose levels in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is held best under 7 percent , the re@@ sear@@ cher .
after the surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflec@@ ts in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mort@@ ality in five years , as the executive re@@ sear@@ cher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also represents an average result of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs 2,1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ throw of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence of a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was sub@@ jected with ob@@ ese people who died in ob@@ es@@ ity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die during the age of 15 , compared with a group which tried the conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing for people with a BMI less than 35 that are interested in the process .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , without increased risk of death , or kid@@ ney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their physi@@ ci@@ ans should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we have to wait for a long time , until we bring people to take this serious , &quot; she said .
I think that once they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes , they have firm@@ ly linked their bodies to ob@@ es@@ ity and diabetes , is truly hard . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not res@@ ume all refugees , the Dalai Lama promised to confirm the effective solution of the refugees in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders required to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of ongoing refuge@@ e crisis in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he said that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be challeng@@ ed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also st@@ ressed that the reaction of the uro@@ pe@@ an countries on the refugees are ad@@ mir@@ able to ad@@ mir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama proposed in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to meet the crisis , he emphas@@ ized that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultim@@ ately , we have to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and comm@@ ented to the terror@@ ist attack on September 11 and introduced that the viol@@ ent reaction of the U.S. embr@@ ac@@ ed a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after 11 September , I expressed my complaint in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to resol@@ ve this problem is in violence .
&quot; I know , his mot@@ ives were good , but he put violence , and that caused an un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four@@ fold increase from taking hand san@@ iti@@ zer by children over the last 4 years
Tox@@ ic controls in the USA report about almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age inf@@ ect@@ ant hand san@@ iti@@ zer , as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , rose the cases of hand san@@ iti@@ zer in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ic@@ ating center report , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly common to those products , and unfortunately , one percentage of them go to the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drinking some children , while some people do to im@@ press their friends or im@@ press for a mut@@ ation in social media .
Videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant can drink only because of cheap experiences .
ju@@ ven@@ iles have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth water to obtain a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be sho@@ cked by attractive del@@ ect@@ ants of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are perf@@ ume .
there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berries , wine grapes and orange juice , which are very attractive for children .
chand@@ ising inf@@ ect@@ ant contain from 45 to 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , a few sy@@ ringe can lead to alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Ven@@ om call centre at the University of Kan@@ sas , Channel Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not leave a si@@ p wh@@ is@@ key , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a quick opportunity to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had caught up four sy@@ ringe after stra@@ wberry du@@ f@@ ten@@ se &apos;s hand san@@ iti@@ zer was taken into a commercial emergency room .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered to be dr@@ unk by an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated at G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go to the position when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and sat down the head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very f@@ righ@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my son .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non@@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants to store and hand san@@ iti@@ zer out of the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after the slip of hands @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which dis@@ posed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingre@@ dient .
health workers susp@@ ects that the Product of meth@@ anol contained a dead@@ ly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingre@@ dient .
in January there were three students in the fourth class in New York State , their &quot; de@@ filed &quot; teacher to po@@ ison@@ ing anti@@ bacter@@ ial products around the class@@ room , &quot; it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police inspec@@ ted the ver@@ ified plan as &quot; brothers &quot; and p@@ amp@@ ered discipl@@ inary action to the debt .

now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened .

why I will be to be an Ex@@ ec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for a late leg@@ ally intervention , I will see how a man is to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p is expressed through the po@@ ison .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day appro@@ ached , I started to fear myself .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the death penalty .
a unique perspective would offer .
it is true that journalists are looking for exec@@ utions in the USA , and since often more applications are available as places , there is a mac@@ ab@@ aster lot@@ tery taking place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media grounds from 12 to five .
who is selected who will watch it emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we lau@@ gh a lot if we speak .
the prison authorities tell that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to re@@ mind me of all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma decided to give me to Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the pris@@ oner , as he wants us and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
they dre@@ amed it &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; but it always th@@ inks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he says not what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses anytime .
but he wants that an international porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he consi@@ ders that publi@@ city work is helping out against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a representative of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please see the po@@ dc@@ asts , which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to return to all details here .
I can &apos;t say to it , that Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to be a benef@@ icial effect .
but I believe that a strong prob@@ ability is that he is not guilty of death .
I believe it is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and I will surely die from this perspective .
I can &apos;t pret@@ end to be really objective .
other re@@ porter will give you to which you can apply .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man un@@ necessary death .

he aims at the ste@@ wards and the integr@@ ity branch of Racing Victoria and claimed that she led a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ atch from Lady Tat@@ ai on a race of day after a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw .
Moody said Fair@@ fax media that he is always trying to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it was about the positive Cobalt @-@ colour sample at Lid@@ aris that he cannot explain .
he had recovered 18 months because of the sp@@ y @-@ critic@@ ism and didn &apos;t want it as much as high hands grapes . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t say anything about it , and I have eaten a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes at once , &quot; Moody said .
they know they are broad@@ ly .
sometimes people react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
ton@@ ight , I will go home and well sleeping .
I would like to re@@ ap the grave , and I would like my owner think I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .

but I arrived at the point in which I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will prac@@ tise the pressure on her and push them up a decision .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes with Riv@@ als for suspension attack
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called the &quot; Agenda &quot; Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League Favor@@ ites on the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ r@@ ator of the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring strug@@ gles &quot; with his team during the high Storm score in Sydney on Friday night allowed .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer , Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hard cover to the Storm @-@ Team after his crew had sco@@ red the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Que@@ ens@@ land not &quot; good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said she will be concentrated on her &quot; contact &quot; at T@@ ack@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy , added that the critic@@ ism of two leading coach on his team did conf@@ ident that they are concerned of becoming wor@@ ried about the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; that emerg@@ es again - I didn &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson on Ring@@ alo@@ ons spoke , when she sm@@ itten with 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ ensive system or techniques , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les to an effective centre and this has provided the trend for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he has obviously had a great team . he &apos;s probably not getting used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock to him .
it &apos;s funny , as always emerg@@ es again in this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and remin@@ ds its ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St. George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long @-@ leg@@ gy &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne talks of exciting soccer .
he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting your game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a du@@ bi@@ ous tri@@ ck .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his way of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so that they can play as they play .
I have stronger confidence , because they say these things , because they are a bit wor@@ ried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they probably won &apos;t have thought about when it went around the Big games .
Bell@@ amy also showed that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters has achieved a higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attemp@@ ts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have a little bit of ten@@ sions ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase yet .
the Storm @-@ Team has free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin next for tomorrow .
Serbian with 200.000 $ damage deposit to Dro@@ gen@@ an@@ kl@@ age
a man that possibly threat@@ ens a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence due to his tem@@ pt@@ ation , in the pos@@ session of 40 kilograms of Kok@@ ain , has been forged with a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police police found 100 kg of the drug at the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America on V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed in place where he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where police found 40 kilograms of the Dro@@ ge in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly a life pun@@ ishment for the attempt to poss@@ ess a commercial amount of oc@@ aine , ar@@ gu@@ ed the adv@@ oc@@ ate of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that he tried to poss@@ ess the whole amount and that in the caf@@ e could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was wor@@ ried about the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has a clear relations to Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
he had exerc@@ ised the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and ste@@ pf@@ ather had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as a security in order to reach his release .
&quot; after reading the Swiss con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Fl@@ ag@@ an .
but it alone won &apos;t be enough to stop him away , not to appear .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was det@@ ained against security , under the conditions that he will depart from his Australian and his Serbian passport , at the police station and at an initial unit of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

a ped@@ agog@@ ic device used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to claim pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from whom he sent a series of un@@ de@@ cent pictures of children that sent him from another user .
the girl moved on and discovered that the phone was lack@@ ed and found it in the hands of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it by , found the conf@@ using news and al@@ armed her mother .
the police appeared therefore and saw the five images , analysed on the computer that were found under the address , and discovered &quot; web @-@ speaking , the concepts used for the search of un@@ relevant pictures of children .

so@@ use sof@@ ter on small border trans@@ itions to Germany
more than ever more refugees are attacked by the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many camp@@ uses made from fear of discovery and capture people increased in smaller bound@@ aries .

the mass makes it : all two years show the car bu@@ ilder at the IAA their no@@ vel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is especially popular with the compact cars , which is currently particularly well for sale .
currently , cars from the compact class are currently in particular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of the new reg@@ istr@@ ations were dis@@ missed by the KRA@@ F@@ LIGHT @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is also reflected by the IAA ( People &apos;s days 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , all new compact models will be presented in this year .
one of the biggest names for the German automobile industry is Opel Astra , who will stand on dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
he belongs to the core of the brand .
the volume of the volume is also well sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel is a starting point of the biggest oppon@@ ents VW Golf in view at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is starting from € 16 990 .
the Astra provides a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
moreover , the H@@ esse also offer diesel engines and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first three @-@ cylinder gasoline engine .
unlike the most important competition VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra can only be recognized as one fifth .
as a second variation , it will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ compet@@ itors Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the trade show , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ fifth in a conventional and under@@ lying sporty GT @-@ version .
in the beginning of the year he will also come as a station wagon .
Infiniti : all new in the segment by Infiniti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ Tr@@ actor wants to find his position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infiniti with its curved lines perfectly fit into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , its world premiere in Frankfurt .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an Ex @-@ in@@ mate of the justice system of the Te@@ gel , which was lo@@ osed in a small cell in a small cell .
because of viol@@ ation of their human di@@ gn@@ ity , prisoners are basically damaged on financial compensation when they are stored in small cells .
this decision made a decision on the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht in a decision on Wednesday .
according to the persons concerned , the persons may even hope to money if they were im@@ pris@@ oned only a few days in the rooms were im@@ pris@@ oned ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an explosion @-@ pris@@ oner with his const@@ itutional system was successfully completed in Karlsruhe , Germany : he was placed in a single cell with five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was cle@@ ared .
after this , the man , who has now been transferred to his feet again in the open base , has been moved to a larger cell .
his liability for civil liability due to un@@ worthy liability for the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court revers@@ ed the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and directed the case to rene@@ w it back there .
they in@@ ju@@ red human di@@ gn@@ ity of man .
Chamber decision now dec@@ ides on height of compensation
even if legal reasons for the un@@ question@@ able period , only a few days of arrest for the compensation for compensation is to be a compensation , it was called .
otherwise , &quot; the person of the personality would be to fear . &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clar@@ ify the amount of money .
the Constitutional Ju@@ di@@ ctions have often adopted the rights of pris@@ oned prisoners in the past .
they only spoke to damages in April of a pris@@ oner because he was naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 according to the majority of a cell without separate toilet .
moreover , in addition the German Constitutional Court , a pris@@ oner in a parall@@ el@@ fall in November 2009 , confirmed a de@@ cent housing .
the lab@@ s of that time was between 15 and 21 hours a day , between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ um@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come to the head@@ lines for the last weeks .
of course , prisoners are rising again next 23 hours , which aggres@@ si@@ fied itself , it should have already happened due to the challeng@@ ed location .
according to the justice place , 21 positions are not occupied in Te@@ gel due to young gels , 19 should go away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
immig@@ ration to refugees is a trem@@ end@@ ous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is resol@@ ved to take it .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to the forec@@ asts of the German Ministry of Education , according to Germany , following statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even in the position to take a million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstr@@ ates the un@@ conventional challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we are able to do this . &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
according to different pro@@ gn@@ oses between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Pest@@ le @-@ Institute ) Apartments every year , and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 homes ) .
the def@@ icient is the lack of living space but above all with paid rental objects : annually resulted from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments from the rental budget , and in order to apply for these particularly affordable housing .
Federal Minister for Federal Ministry Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore plans to double the promotion , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ le Institute : 80 000 social apartments every year , and this association would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year .
the researchers and the Federal Ministry for Research that there has also been to give more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to estimates by the Institute for Emp@@ loyment Research , it is assumed that the long @-@ term 55 percent of the val@@ leys in Germany may be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be system@@ atically asked to help them when entering the entry level , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is decisive if they are working in Germany .
labour is the key for social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation in the recording group , but for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of mig@@ rants , says , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , a political turn was given : from the labour market for refugees to recognition of work .
while earlier established a working group for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Resid@@ ency of the asylum seek@@ ers to place a residence .
in society , it is also because of the skilled staff - mostly way of vis@@ ibility that refugees should be made faster than the labour market to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack@@ ing German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient range of general and occup@@ ational courses .
research shows that jobs should most often be medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore possible to view the throne of the König@@ s@@ weg to work .
the Berlin School management have found that only a few escap@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ es , estimated that it is quite important to maintain the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate .
to con@@ vince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , distri@@ b@@ utes and distri@@ b@@ ances in different languages .
if the need to recover from the large number of refugees strongly , the Berlin Senate will try to increase the training capacities , by raising more technical schools .
in the countries , pupils without German will be prepared in Welcome to the classes .
they are not always trained by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language .
there is no lack of activities by the Berlin School administration .
the German student works estimates that around 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
ration@@ ality does not say any Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or mem@@ o@@ ded the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) , but has given his position .
studies illi@@ es may facilit@@ ate access to the university .
because refugees with an residence permit or just no services will get any more performance after the asylum application Act , unless they begin studying .
in principle , no BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , since it may not fall ben@@ e@@ ath the persons concerned .
Ged@@ ul@@ ted refugees had to have lived in Germany four years to be entitled to be BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 to short@@ ened this span for 15 months .
this funding gap must also be closed , call Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German student works .
the students should get immediately BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and many are the religion important part of their identity .
the state should be gover@@ ned by the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ relig@@ ions relationship .
it also would be important for the creation of an Islamic welfare state , which car@@ es professional for re@@ fu@@ els .
the rights belong to the rights .
so the Re@@ present@@ atives of Islam have to be informed in clear persons and ready to work with the state in many areas and led him certain control options .
this also includes the read@@ iness to act against religious fundam@@ ent@@ alism .
the Ch@@ air@@ person of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , on Thursday the wor@@ ries , religious conflic@@ ts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to con@@ quer such conflic@@ ts in Germany , &quot; immediately you have the right to wake up here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he propos@@ e to transl@@ ate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integr@@ ating in future will be much more than today a topic of all the society .
the majority of the majority must also change , dis@@ cri@@ mination and rac@@ ism is per@@ v@@ ested .
as a result , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a non @-@ dis@@ cri@@ mination of anti @-@ dis@@ cri@@ mination legislation and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it is very slow , as the NSU M@@ ord@@ t series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive will be system@@ atically ig@@ no@@ red .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rants organisations supply and the interested people are oblig@@ atory . must become reality when the anti@@ r@@ ass@@ is@@ mic intervention Germany must remain in the next few years , if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens are to benefit from their possibilities - to the sole of all .
in general , Germany was able to medi@@ cally care mainly refugees from physi@@ ci@@ ans , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; what kind of MAN@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we said this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , extra money into the system flow .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to all cultiv@@ ate equal to the registration of health cards .
the services may later be reck@@ oned with the federal states later .
and for the long term , it is highly question@@ able so many people want to see the restricted performance catalog to see the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise , the doctors make the language bar@@ riers to create .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de proved to be trac@@ ed to mig@@ rants about their diseases than other patients .
not only clinics , but in the heal@@ thcare costs , Dol@@ met@@ er@@ x@@ es would have to pay for them .
however , many refugees would also be assist@@ ed in emergency ambul@@ ances in case of emergency cases .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugees there are significantly more cru@@ de dis@@ abilities , and with the young people go to HIV .
with the partial different clinical pictures of German doctors from their education , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery cry .
&quot; paras@@ ite fall or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to see . &quot; and what the doctors fought because of refugees , rather a relief is in sight .
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some refugees were even physi@@ ci@@ ans .
in order to be practic@@ ing , however , they must prove their qualification and see professional tests .
at least half of the refugees in Germany is psych@@ ically ill @-@ psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( BP@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ically ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress dis@@ order or de@@ pression .
especially infr@@ in@@ gement of refuge@@ e children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the BP@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by TU München received that every fifth Syrian refuge@@ e population is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress dis@@ order , amongst others , amongst others , flash@@ backs with re@@ spir@@ ing , di@@ zz@@ iness , cr@@ abs and wr@@ ong@@ es .
further symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , strong cra@@ ft@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment was necessary , explained am@@ mun@@ ition .
however , only four percent of psych@@ olog@@ ically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy until now .
although psych@@ olog@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can imagine a application for psych@@ otherapy , but it usually lasts several months .
in addition , we would not have trained in the social offices or doctors who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ under@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe keeps false speech in parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , African leaders , cli@@ pped down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly through Social Media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also en@@ rob@@ bed by the opposition of MP@@ s , that they had received an@@ ony@@ me deaths , and they had been war@@ ned by Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ hr@@ ink .
in the past month they ro@@ wed him and interru@@ pted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - and this is the speech made to return on Tuesday .
the speaker of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions polit@@ icians received SMS messages to their mobile phones , which did war@@ ned , Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ t pron@@ unci@@ ation .
&quot; the message comes from a number which is not displayed , but he said the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mug@@ ab@@ es .
it accounts for the affected Parliament members , in Parliament resol@@ ved , and once they rely on parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer valid .
the chief spokes@@ man led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ ang@@ ir@@ ai was &quot; wor@@ ried &quot; about the dang@@ ers for the polit@@ icians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25.000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of re@@ structuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later on , HP is split into two listed companies and the computer and printer business of its faster growing company hardware and business activities .
the expected employment rate leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in a declaration .
&quot; this re@@ structuring measures will enable a competitive economic structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive that lead the unit according to separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a small and stronger than it &apos;s HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ est portfolio of shops , supporting companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a stand@@ alone company we are better than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing an integrated technology solutions to companies so far , &quot; a statement of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , to produce electric plants and the Pal@@ o Alto Garage you have called &quot; the bir@@ th@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive change of re@@ structure in order to cope with the turn of traditional PCs around mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the latest in this field , which is based on belief that invol@@ ve better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mate is standing before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb beyond the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ized against Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only in September and if his rehab@@ il@@ itation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he couldn &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace for this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season after a separate dum@@ my injury and returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not end@@ ang@@ ered the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that is not good .
it is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the in@@ jur@@ ies that he had previously .
this may be true of pure medical vis@@ ibility , but as Wen@@ ger also recognised , there is the danger of further in@@ jur@@ ies , ever since a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it evol@@ ves also an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the study by Premier In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd has 23 different diseases in Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut , six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of more ar@@ sen@@ al 157 items in the last five playing times .
the larger image for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight games times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs who have been one of the most vul@@ ner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of vic@@ ious law , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate is final during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from a viol@@ ation , you have a vul@@ ner@@ able period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and fight against battle , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ izes , I am conf@@ ident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the type he deser@@ ves .
Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League Cup final on Wednesday night before playing Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger exhib@@ iting a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling in Croatia , which means that Math@@ ieu de@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should be started .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I try to maintain the balance and players who need it to treat a little break . &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsen@@ al clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing fields with the biggest tra@@ jec@@ tory in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was rock@@ ed on Tuesday evening by an earthquake that were measured on the &quot; Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League demonstr@@ ations against Monaco and remains committed by the far away hope to lead the association to his first European victory .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ se &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked with ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ aming .
friendship : the com@@ edy show that gran@@ ts us serious lessons by men .
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in regard to them as the need for men to open , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ mur@@ als below young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in males aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there are three times more common in men than for women .
in terms of re@@ im@@ ing the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a er@@ b@@ ärm@@ land Life ) announced as the year of man to ask the culture of question that men are prev@@ ented to ask help , if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the heart to master this challenge .
a current study of more than 2,000 High @-@ School students with de@@ pressed symptoms showed that when the suffering end a sufficient amount of friends with a healthy mood , &quot; his chances are dou@@ bling .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends only to work for friendship .
in the age of social media , communication with her focus on substance , the in@@ ability of response is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , che@@ er@@ ful , and successful , even if the isolation is dominated by isolation .
this su@@ perf@@ icial success will call , what psych@@ olog@@ ists define extr@@ al@@ istic values ; money , image , social status , everything on cost in@@ tr@@ is@@ in terms of personal development and friendship that affects on our spiritual health .
and just like a video game inv@@ entor and billi@@ on@@ aire , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent embr@@ aces , moments in the football look at the football look at Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to each case even if they are often re@@ tained to expl@@ oring its feelings .
as a employee of the phone past@@ oral care es me : ... &quot; my list@@ ener leading to people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ risk , has shown me really clearly , as even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us , often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old re@@ application &quot; has an enormous impact as the feeling that it is perce@@ ived as weak@@ ness , if you speak about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term evidence mechan@@ isms .
they are clearly presented the small moments of men .
so much my objective out@@ sider status via the phone calls us to assist people in moments of des@@ pair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day , you can &apos;t visit your friends . why not take your friends to drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give it a smile and say hi .
you never know what difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 ep@@ iso@@ des - for friendship
di Maria meets to help PSG up in Malm@@ ö , Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani to his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and finally helps Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain put his Champions League 2012 with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as the PSG - player before they finally missed a number of opportunities , before they finally increased their lead , when Cav@@ ani came in at 6@@ 1. minute a head@@ shot .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Donetsk in the group A , Paris will need a strong start against the Swedish Master , since they are not only reaching the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the track to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campa@@ igns .
but while they received the points , it was not a Classical Straight from Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s Team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later began in play against his h@@ omet@@ own team and against the club , which he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or to win in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to cause pro@@ ving our oppon@@ ents problems and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected out during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; it is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I don &apos;t need to have one or two more goals . &quot;
Burma him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris Team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw on their own place against Bordeaux in the First league , but it was pushed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man to take over the next level in Europe when he crossed the next level in Europe when he ran to Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he completed in Johan Wil@@ de over the long corner of the net .
but if any one believed that there would be a great victory that was dis@@ appointed .
Malm@@ ö distri@@ but@@ ing the Celtic in a Play @-@ off to reach this level with nine nation@@ alities in the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , ins@@ ulating a heavy opponent .
but except for a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who goes far to Kevin Tr@@ apps &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they boot little in attack .
instead , there was often sometimes on , with some dis@@ patches and bad s@@ oc@@ ieties , not least later than five default in the first half of p@@ atz@@ oth and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had put it after re@@ boot .
yet he proved much more skill when he brought his players into play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria turned into a turning point , directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the posts ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the har@@ vest@@ ers reached its sixth seas@@ onal form , after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic got a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this finished all the thoughts to come back in Malm@@ ö , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could stop the final score before removing the E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gateway to the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age H@@ are@@ ide there was later that there was a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game has been in December last year .
since then we have played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the qual@@ ifications are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

the FC Bayern clearly stood before a few years ago prior to the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played back to FC Barcelona .

matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film
matt Dam@@ on con@@ fron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said they will not need behind the scenes .
during a succ@@ ession of Sunday Night from H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , emphas@@ ized the necess@@ ity of alternative pro@@ spects and indeed regarding a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the selected scenario of the project .
&quot; if we speak of variety , then do it in the line@@ up of the film and not by the show of the show , &quot; simplified Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted matt , with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the writer &apos;s comments made by The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown was developed by the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to think about to think about this - who also will always be the director - as she will deal with the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown at first .
the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te who is beaten by her white im@@ ps .
the producer of De@@ ar White People gave herself for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direc@@ ting &quot; at the end could be something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded ahead of Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip by talking &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - this is SO K@@ NOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the Twe@@ et def@@ endant more than 5,000 Ret@@ ets and 4,000 L@@ ikes since its publication .
Dam@@ ons comments are at a time when the precise representation of representation in the media is on the top of social discussion .
after the teenage Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement Black L@@ ives achieved outstanding laws and offici@@ als , dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ated practices against col@@ leg@@ ality .
in February , the singer Prince pays an effort to the Gram@@ my Awards for the introduction of the nominated albums of the year .
&quot; album quiet matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
as books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
in younger times , leaders of the Movement Black L@@ ives released a declaration in response to the question of Fox News personality , Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a h@@ ate group .
&quot; the network of Black L@@ ives Mat@@ ter is a lov@@ em@@ aking group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the west .
if he accepted the invitation or already made the Pope , it is un@@ clear .

professional sport climbing and ease of use Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which ended up their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , which could close all the steps of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the final task was climbing to a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time with which he was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete , which ended up the str@@ en@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked with E ! messages to the hard @-@ beat victory , still under the shock over the prize of the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; I mean it is amazing to think about what I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or his life , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap money .
as suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed won with The Hollywood re@@ porter , in order to discuss the final and why it did , although he finished the course of the par@@ cours , not any prize money .
after the rules , money is the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it &apos;s the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe that he he@@ els some gro@@ oves on it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
mass@@ es of awards earned his fans from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be sm@@ itten with someone , then I &apos;m glad , that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I gu@@ ess that Isaac would have felt , if they had changed the ro@@ les .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a second version , which will begin fil@@ ming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers lost to Min@@ nes@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ W@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers will stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday against the Min@@ nes@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Twin@@ s now uses an opportunity for asc@@ en@@ sion within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card space .
for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F word , which was so hard to deal with a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit offered three times in the first two interior , then once in the sixth and then once again in the n@@ inth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) smote 6 times in the 1 / 3 internal and made three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , so I want to focus on into the game .
the designed tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August .
it was the first thre@@ w hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits on Seattle on July 6 .
&quot; he has been wor@@ ship@@ ed the r@@ ash well , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
he looked good at ( percussion training ) , saw clearly better in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it to the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into play .
Center Fiel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the In@@ ning with a double on the left front line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y ran over the wall , the only man , with whom he con@@ fron@@ ted , before the designed Rookie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , the right @-@ handed a Two @-@ Run hur@@ ri@@ ages .
with a pair of run@@ ners and the closing @-@ run on the second , star@@ red the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a Double Play .
it was the major league &apos;s leading 27th times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a Double Play .
after Detroit starts at the end of the n@@ inth Inn@@ ings a fun @-@ run , a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ los des Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and sco@@ red the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but right @-@ handed down S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the beginning of the game by an un@@ able Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two interior against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an which was painted in front of the game provided by the injury list , after having been missing more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had w@@ ished for me , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt right , when I started and felt some pretty good Pit@@ ches , because I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches . &quot;
after they received the lead @-@ off counter in the first lead , H@@ ushes made a single with Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; when the first run of the game .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain lots of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but w@@ ho@@ ever wants to mind on his sl@@ ender line , he often shall be t@@ elec@@ ted of them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits anyway : in them are putting B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. above all , Mang@@ os but lots of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports tend@@ ency , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
in buying , man@@ gan@@ ese should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleas@@ ing .
the sh@@ al@@ ion alone does not say anything about how rip@@ e the fruit - so also green Mang@@ os can taste very delicious .
they should store room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or sweet food .
a man@@ go gives also a heart@@ y dishes a special touch .
you mil@@ let the slightly bitter taste man@@ go leaf sal@@ ads like Chic@@ ore@@ e and Radi@@ cc@@ io .

on Wednesday and at night the w@@ ages are partly blow@@ ing by the p@@ amp@@ ers .
after fir@@ ing on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , the strong rain falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
like met@@ e@@ or news in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong Süd@@ west@@ ward .
at the night@@ fall of the Alps it breaks out through the val@@ leys at night .
as a result , the w@@ ages of up to Thursday morning will blow up to Thursday morning with floors of 60 to 100 km / h , partly absorbed and specifically in the Ur@@ ner@@ land as well as at over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer may go through to the adjacent in@@ land V@@ ord@@ r@@ ingen , and in the mountains even or@@ can hills of over 120 km / h are possible .
during the north on Wednesday , F@@ öh@@ n with@@ stands for summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the F@@ atigue strength begins .
here rain starts to Thursday afternoon until Thursday evening .
in sum , south of the Alps has to be expected in the next 48 hours , with more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , that after the last few days there are already large rain volumes .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Re@@ formation in Rome there is now a Martin Luther Square .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ az@@ io Marino , a far nam@@ eless place in the park at the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill were bapt@@ ised on the name of the German Re@@ form@@ ators .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now hon@@ oured as a &quot; German the@@ olog@@ ian of the Re@@ formation . &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied for the German occupation of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the parish of Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rem@@ ind@@ ed that the Protest@@ ants were able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority often in secret their faith .
with the square it is visible in a symbo@@ lic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) beh@@ aved as a young August@@ in@@ erm@@ ön@@ ch for the year 1510 / 11 some months in Rome .
he received the city as a moderate sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions may have helped him in view of histor@@ ians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then led the split of the du@@ tch church with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ las@@ h@@ an@@ del .
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Thor@@ ns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar was painted for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated the Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formed in 150 mot@@ ifs his very personal interaction of bibli@@ cal stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and f@@ anc@@ if@@ ul shapes has received 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but not far as important is with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the relevant topics can affect the quite dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar is worked on his b@@ ible project for which he made a sub@@ jec@@ tive @-@ artistic selection of many subject areas of the &quot; Book of Books . &quot;
were Cy@@ cles , which themes like wild@@ life , pl@@ agues , commandments or p@@ ater@@ nal .
with this he has fascin@@ ated several partners at the same time : this also applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ publishing with its focus on art books .
and since all the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post is the basis of painting with the respective Bible sets apart .
he interpre@@ ted the Bible Study by Ot@@ mar Alt , interpre@@ ted in today , in current arran@@ gements . &quot;
these texts are such as ver@@ bal mir@@ rors of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded in between the original bibli@@ cal moments of Martin Luther and one part of the artist , who form@@ ulated his very personal thoughts here .
the jewel @-@ tape has gold Let@@ ters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep gli@@ mp@@ se into his soul . its emot@@ ions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emot@@ ions were ultim@@ ately born as a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ n@@ iger@@ ode and raised in Berlin from a family that list@@ ens to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler of Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter .
&quot; the up@@ bringing ever happened to the cane , &quot; remember Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; I have tried to rev@@ ise this , and perhaps will be able to end@@ ure me with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in high @-@ lasting time again : &quot; the per@@ c@@ eption of imag@@ ination is influenced by a claim today , and it is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being edged out .
artists have another pleasure and ass@@ onne to show things .
pictures always have a mystery and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewer click &quot; catch up &quot; and let them go on , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for an object . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post st@@ up on Tuesday during the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like working with his paintings . &quot;
old did not count to capture the Bible completely , but that important topics were chosen for him .
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about the images , the text explained only . &quot; I created a picture of images .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther publishing house this work is an invitation to find &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both of both the ( bibli@@ cal ) language of love as well as respon@@ si@@ bilities .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and screens - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition held on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .

DF@@ B inten@@ si@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga starts a clear sign in the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to developing an emerging situation in Germany and ensures that the policy in addres@@ sing of the upcoming problems .
&quot; I have been holding this for the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ un@@ ification . &quot;
&quot; there is no one in the principle that no one concerns me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must all be interested in this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to inten@@ sely affect the refuge@@ e situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the office of law and meet the State Minister of Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the law office . &quot;
&quot; the subject is certainly playing a central role , &quot; he announced .
soccer you can help and do wool .
but the decisive factor must be the policy .
therefore the German S@@ occer League has wid@@ ened its sub@@ mission of refugees &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; we have ensu@@ red the Eg@@ idi@@ us Braun Stiftung that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal lists support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ duc@@ ers get a clear sign when refer@@ ring to the left of the Jersey instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship ( Her@@ mes ) , &quot; We can help &quot; # Re@@ fuge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only do , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ head Rudi Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e drama goes every day , nobody can go away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to use our radi@@ als , our impact and ways to help the many refugees who have already suffered so un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
Hoff@@ en@@ gen@@ s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent signs of the League . &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of women took 100 refugees to Halle / Saale for the national team in Hungary .
N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach signed the support for refugees as a &quot; large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license must have started in their own projects , be great .
the smallest is that small and smallest in@@ sist@@ s active there are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; which we have spent will live in football .
&quot; this is of huge importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will cooper@@ ate with DF@@ B selection and funding of € 300 000 for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the Ver@@ eine did not record the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP managing director losing an eye in the accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost most of several reports by a fall in the beginning of July .
after the accident on the stair@@ case to the house of his brother in the USA he was looking after midnight on a water glass that he took in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic weekly &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; it is almost ins@@ ul@@ ted , was usual , then to@@ wed down to the road , so that he has told us this last week , &quot; quot@@ ed the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could not follow his work .
&quot; beginning of October we meet in the Supervisory Board of Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was in attend@@ ance of the meeting and &quot; fully un@@ employed . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will return to Germany in October and continue the software guest in October .
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is usually based in Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to go to the public with such a personal story to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen so . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to stand up again when you are fallen . &quot;

the National Player is also mentioned on the S@@ FK Krasno@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t look back on him , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ i said on Wednesday .
if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga @-@ Top@@ Play against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in the face of the high loading of its professionals , Tu@@ sel will not only change its stem from the Re@@ us position .
he then announced a change to the go@@ al@@ keeping position .
so Roman We@@ iden@@ fel@@ eller accepts the seat of ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains on an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer teacher pra@@ ised the world champion .
if We@@ iden@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all European league games , Tu@@ ck@@ les left however open .
with a high prob@@ ability it will contest the second batch .
the for@@ tif@@ ier statement by co @-@ actor Re@@ us that the final move for the BV@@ B in the European League has its aim to realize mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian We@@ ig@@ l for compl@@ eting : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;

in Germany , Germany wants to emplo@@ y an international maximum speed of self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the federal government plans to introduce themselves to a change in the Vienna agreement , which now only sees human beings as a driver .
when automated driving takes over the car the car , the rider becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the surroundings and process the data in seconds .
after a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Research , highly automated driving will be techn@@ ically possible to motor@@ ways by 2020 .
nevertheless , your driving vehicles will be expected to be expected by 2020 . &quot;
the value creation in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions on the location of Germany will appreciate the authors of the study by 2025 on about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD road polit@@ ician S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
the question of liability for acc@@ idents and safety of personal data of the drivers must be clearly understood .
but the german self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than Fr@@ ench@@ men or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA @-@ based inquiry of the For@@ sa @-@ Institute on behalf of the test company DEK@@ RA comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars should be sustain@@ ed in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect that 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those survey@@ ed by 2025 can be made with autonomous cars in the U.S. , 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave the car completely self @-@ prop@@ elled car .
after a survey of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to the control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the free@@ way , more than 15 per cent of the traffic can be present in the stand of 45 per cent .
but everyone respec@@ ted the control of no circumst@@ ance in the car .

it is a blend of great fashion show and a wax @-@ tomb @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : designer Jean Paul Men@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look very busy thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , amongst others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as out@@ fits to the large star of the Mo@@ des@@ scene - and thus that he was men in skirts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the f@@ ant in the Haute Cout@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , it &apos;s really &quot; said Gaul@@ ish .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 to the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a chance that the Mod@@ esch@@ o@@ yer has at first changed a show about his person .
because he had been a little bit about death , &quot; he said , &quot; He had a little bit of death for me . &quot; he said .
when you die , one gets into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made public in Canada and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an in@@ sight into the missing work of man , the fashion history , without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ olog@@ ically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ated general art@@ work which has been run for the much effort : to fr@@ ise the dol@@ ls , has been committed for instance a styl@@ ist .
14 tons of material were lost according to the name of the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the October launch it was a special fast@@ ener : a leather p@@ ants out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sm@@ ur@@ red as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ ish .
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers alter Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ile fashion@@ able reading tests of the design .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he told his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gaul@@ ish said .
to play with a doll , his parents have not allowed him .
he later taught the dis@@ card of fashion later .
he ste@@ els some fashion cap@@ tions and looked at the designs of other designers , as the Gaul@@ ish in Munich .
later I bought it then .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the models .
they received no , but could not keep the clothes .
Jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener point as fashion n@@ iche
previous h it went to the long Stick@@ ers in and around Pl@@ auen on Earth .
the embro@@ idered fabri@@ cs and tips were produced in a large quantity for customers that they for@@ warded to ce@@ il@@ ings and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ desp@@ ised plan .
instead the mode is important .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener point fashion played a major role , then it was pushed back by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as n@@ iche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , on accessories such as bags and for regional cost@@ umes .
the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which rel@@ ates to the past sty@@ list@@ ic periods , an increasing client potential .
who is not operated in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available in the market .
with us they have already made half of all orders .
Mo@@ desp@@ ised Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies a member of the Bran@@ ch Society of Pl@@ au@@ gh@@ y and Embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales were moved .
private experts and also the whol@@ es@@ ale there are almost no more .
our products only reach our customers on this road .
nowadays the mass goods are produced in Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
moreover , export of export , current to Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points as Cord@@ ula Bauer by Embro@@ ider@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; this year we lead a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmental and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt explains : &quot; this also refers to the used materials . &quot;
she taught at the University of Applied Arts in Berlin at Schnee@@ berg branch of the Hochschule Zw@@ ick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is speci@@ alis@@ ing in stit@@ ches and tips .
to counter the competition an out of the Asian region , you must find sophisticated and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often become slightly varied to hold a customer base .
some years ago , Word @-@ conductor Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter has re@@ acquired the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine also sends little kit@@ chens on some places .
the pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ sm@@ ith in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ach was inspired by in@@ spir@@ ing : &quot; before I could not start with traditional sp@@ y head . &quot;
now they use the snow@@ ball point for their jewelry .
in a complex process , they character@@ ise the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener point - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies in the U.S. , after Australia and from Finland - especially to customers who lived in pl@@ anner and surroundings , and want to have a souven@@ ir .
thus I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ assador for the pl@@ ague .

according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not a continuation of re@@ spiration , but also of a kind of continuation that will play 20 years after the first film with magical children &apos;s maid .
it &apos;s about the experience of the N@@ anny family in times of world economic crisis in England .

the Lead@@ ership Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for controlling the market access , relaxation of the bor@@ dering ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants @-@ mel@@ des@@ y .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identify which will not arrive for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , since they present the market a major role in the al@@ location of resource , a legal state area and the market said to open the market .
the government will also be informed about the findings transmitted to the company and make sure that the company will decide how they carry their business .

EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ bound@@ aries in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mer@@ cury in large prem@@ ise and consum@@ ing significantly higher dose of ner@@ ve cells .
moreover , the consumer organization Foo@@ d@@ watch , who critic@@ ises the plans of the EU , critic@@ izing the plans : &quot; risk and side effects of lack of industrial and environmental policy will be passed with full impact on pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; says Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Foo@@ d@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the ner@@ ve target for large fish at the end of the food chain as approximately Ha@@ i- or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury could be raised by one kil@@ ogram of fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are strongly poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury , that approximately 50 per cent of the length may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the threshold levels then only 14.5 percent would be un@@ pol@@ ite .
in return for this procedure , the EU wants to decrease the limit values at other fish currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram .
however , Foo@@ d@@ S described this as &quot; Tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller peace fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low to hold the planned top values today .
the reduction in clar@@ ifier is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ance de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ eu@@ ver , which helps the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
Mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which is strongly enrich@@ ed in the food chain above all in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already small amounts of especially when the ner@@ vous damage can cause . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment declar@@ es on its website with regard to the current limit , but that a &quot; health end@@ ang@@ ering of the general population is not expected .
Mercury came to the environment mainly through the coal combustion .
according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock is drawn up more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thir@@ ds of the total produced in Germany .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fishing is around in El@@ be , Rhine and the Danube . &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been cited in March from the paper .
last year , war@@ nings against mer@@ cury in fish had already counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
