a reag@@ ent for blood @-@ group determination must react with all tested blood samples which are contained in the anti@@ body or another on the label specified substance .
if a reag@@ ent is used by the producer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not occur : a ) ha@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the t@@ iter is measured by the repeat@@ edly dil@@ lution of the tigh@@ test rig in a suitable medium on the double room .
the t@@ iter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the strongest ser@@ um dil@@ uted in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated using the volume of blood cells in the overall volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that can be used on object dreams , the activity is expressed by time , which is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object .
the World Health Organization for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for the blood @-@ group determination of International standards are defined and for reag@@ ents of other specif@@ icity .
according to a definition there is a defin@@ ite number of international units per mg / ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ les , which are observed at individual preparations , red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination of most specif@@ ics is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational point , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ te during a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te .
the T@@ iter gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ents in the last mixture inside a series , where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination , for the International standard prepar@@ es are present ( for the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in comparison to the international standard prepar@@ atory law in international units ( See Bulletin WHO , 1954 , 10 , 937 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ b Ser@@ b contain a definition of 256 International units per ml .

the Group &apos;s international exchange of particular reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination should not be colored as long as long as long as it has come into a uniform system via a uniform system .
reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination are in such a way and in such amounts are not only for performing tests with the un@@ identified blood cells , but also for carrying out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount required in a container must be so large that the contents may be used in this protocol to be used in the protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has all production levels and controls of reag@@ ents to be written in written notes .
adequate samples of all types of reag@@ ents are to be held so long from the laboratory of the laboratory , until with some prob@@ ability , the batch can no longer be used .
the reag@@ ent determination of reag@@ ents can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) of origin ; some of them represent the effective aid to gain effectiveness and preser@@ ving the stability of reag@@ ents .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided according to the origin of their real share in three groups .
it does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each single container is a black on white printed label in English and French . the following information contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
