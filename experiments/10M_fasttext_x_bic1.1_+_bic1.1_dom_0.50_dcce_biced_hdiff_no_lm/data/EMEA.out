Ab@@ il@@ ify is used for tre@@ ating he@@ avier to severe man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and for prevention of man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des in patients who are addressed in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al dis@@ orders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to remove or use the moul@@ ds in patients , which allow the sw@@ allowing of tablets .
in patients who are at the same time other medicines , the same as Ab@@ il@@ ify should be dis@@ integrated , should the dose be adjusted from Ab@@ il@@ ify .
this im@@ paired the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of ner@@ ve cells .
Ari@@ ev@@ raz@@ ole pres@@ um@@ ably works mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ ev@@ raz@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a lower degree as the ne@@ ur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine play a role in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and b@@ ipolar disorder helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and performing it performing .
effic@@ acy of Ab@@ il@@ ify , which inhib@@ its symptoms , was investig@@ ated in three studies of up to one year .
in two studies , the effectiveness of injection solution was compared to 805 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases , which were increased from two hours to a plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Ab@@ il@@ ify was compared to 347 patients with hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol in another study , in another study , effic@@ acy of Ab@@ il@@ ify and plac@@ ebo , to occur in 160 patients who have already been stabil@@ ized with Ab@@ il@@ ify .
the effic@@ acy of Ab@@ il@@ ify injection solution was compared to a study of 301 patients with b@@ ipolar disorder when compared to an increased fr@@ ame@@ di@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of patients received from a standard scale for b@@ ipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on treatment .
the company also led trials to investig@@ ate how the body absor@@ bed the mel@@ s@@ ine and absor@@ bed the solution .
in both studies with injection solution showed , Ab@@ il@@ ify were obtained in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased decrease of symptoms and increased un@@ rest as those patients who were given a plac@@ ebo .
when applying the b@@ ipolar disorder in four of the five short @-@ term studies , Ab@@ il@@ ify was more effective than plac@@ ebo .
Ab@@ il@@ ify prevent@@ ed them as plac@@ ebo over to 74 weeks as inter@@ act to inter@@ act man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des in previously treated patients and when in addition to an existing treatment was admin@@ istered .
Ab@@ il@@ ify @-@ in@@ jec@@ tions in 10 or 15 @-@ mg doses also have also been more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ a@@ zep@@ am .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Ab@@ il@@ ify ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , ac@@ ath@@ isie ( cit@@ rate ) , tre@@ mor ( cit@@ rate ) , thr@@ alg@@ um ( cit@@ rate ) , fatigue ( cit@@ rate ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep changes ) and an@@ xi@@ ety ( sleep changes ) and an@@ xi@@ ety .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) establ@@ ishes the conclusion that the benefits of Ab@@ il@@ ify during the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des during patients with the pre@@ domin@@ antly of a new man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and in which the man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des had to prevail in the treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ole compared to the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorder in patients with chronic ep@@ iso@@ des in Bipolar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a approval for inter@@ transport of Ab@@ il@@ ify throughout the European Union .
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy German@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des of the Bipolar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des , which had the mainly man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and their man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des to the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
a increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , even though single patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , ir@@ respective of the meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
effic@@ acy of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and Bipolar I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
consider@@ ing the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ als should be considered to be considered if clinical factors re@@ produce this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is derived from combination therapy , the Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ iz@@ id@@ ental behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective dis@@ orders and was reported in some cases at the beginning or after the change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with b@@ ipolar disorder does not have an increased risk of risk associated with Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ ell@@ raz@@ ole should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known car@@ cardi@@ ovas@@ cular diseases , her@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency disease , her@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency disease ( de@@ hydr@@ ation disease , hyp@@ ovol@@ ny , treatment with blood @-@ pressure hood medicine ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

if patients treated with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ e in@@ etry should be weak@@ ened in consider@@ ation , to reduce the dose or treatment .
if a patient identif@@ ies signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fe@@ ver without any additional clinical manif@@ estation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole should be related to patients with var@@ ic@@ ose inc@@ idents in the history of cases or in cases of var@@ ic@@ ose inc@@ idents in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years of patients with Ar@@ pip@@ or@@ ol are associated with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had treated patients who were treated with Ari@@ mi@@ raz@@ ole , an increased risk of death in comparison to the plac@@ ebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the promise of un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ az@@ raz@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , in some cases are extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients that were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , related un@@ wanted events with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drug patients treated directly to the same .

a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with b@@ ipolar leads , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight gain as a side effect , and could lead to serious complic@@ ations .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole on the central ner@@ vous system , be careful if Ari@@ ell@@ raz@@ ole should be taken in combination with alcohol and other centr@@ alized drugs components such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist family , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ mi@@ raz@@ ole , but this effect however is not relevant to clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers with a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D6 inhib@@ itor ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ ma@@ raz@@ ole was 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P2@@ D6 , like Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dos@@ ing reduc@@ tions .
for CY@@ P2@@ D6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ ism , the joint application with highly effective inhib@@ itors can result in higher plasma centr@@ ations of Ari@@ ma@@ raz@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D6 exten@@ sively met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you consider the common treatment of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should exceed potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhib@@ itors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors , should have similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dos@@ ing reduc@@ tions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors , the dose of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be increased to the dose @-@ height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .

the patient should be advised to notify your doctor if she are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ mi@@ raz@@ ole .
due to the in@@ adequate data of safety in humans and due to the animal clinical concerns , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits just@@ if@@ ies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are safe that Ari@@ ev@@ raz@@ ole has no negative impact .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , as listed under Plac@@ ebo or were classified as a possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) .
the incidence of the bottom side effects are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occas@@ ionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total of lower inc@@ id@@ ence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , Ac@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sp@@ in@@ es@@ ie , were compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long@@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffer from Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ ell@@ raz@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffer from Ol@@ die therapy .

in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffer from Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term administration phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients suffer from Ari@@ ell@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % to patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ az@@ raz@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potenti@@ ally clin@@ ically significant changes of the regular laboratory parameters did not show medical significant differences .
enhanc@@ ements of C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asym@@ pt@@ omatic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ar@@ pip@@ or@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .

in clinical trials and since the market launch , acc@@ id@@ ental or deli@@ ber@@ ated over@@ dose with Ari@@ az@@ raz@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg , and without death .
although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ med aly@@ sis in tre@@ ating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ ane raz@@ ole ; however , it is un@@ likely that hem@@ med aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , as Ari@@ ma@@ raz@@ ole has a high plasma cutting .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ole is transmitted via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole showed an high aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and D3 recept@@ or and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ or as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and to the Hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
in the gift of Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the potential @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ sier dependent reduction in the binary form of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recept@@ or Lig@@ anden , on Nu@@ CL@@ EUS cau@@ or @-@ Lig@@ anden , at the Nu@@ CL@@ EUS cau@@ or @-@ Lig@@ ue .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in comparison to 1,@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in one sem@@ id@@ id@@ ol controlled trial , in week 52 the share of Respon@@ sible patients who had an instru@@ ctor worked in both groups similar ( Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - de@@ pres@@ sion@@ sr@@ ata scale , showed a significantly higher improvement than Sem@@ oper@@ id@@ ol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks on stabil@@ ized patients with chronic scr@@ ap@@ op@@ hren@@ ia was significantly higher reduction in the dec@@ lining rate of 34 % in the Ar@@ pip@@ raz@@ ole group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an Ol@@ die @-@ controlled , mult@@ in@@ ational double @-@ blind study found in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients involved in significantly less patients with a minimum increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of approx .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed ep@@ isode of the Bipolar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ ev@@ raz@@ ole was superior to plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks .

in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy over 12 weeks in patients with chronic or mixed ep@@ iso@@ prop@@ ane , Ari@@ ma@@ raz@@ ole showed a superior effic@@ acy in week 3 and an ongoing effect , comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ ev@@ raz@@ ole also obtained a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ omatic re@@ mission of the mania on such as lithium or semi @-@ oper@@ id@@ ol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with chronic or mixed ep@@ isode of a b@@ ipolar disorder treatment , with or without mental characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ole was superior to mal@@ nutrition in comparison to mal@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in relation to a stabil@@ ization phase , Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole le@@ op@@ ted to plac@@ ebo over the prevention of a b@@ ipolar re@@ treat , primarily in the prevention of a re@@ treat in the Man@@ ia .

in Ari@@ me@@ raz@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and also showed no gender @-@ dependent effects in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination .
a pop@@ ulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ ell@@ raz@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ ad@@ raz@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with varied liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect in patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw shots to their met@@ abolic capacity .

the effic@@ acy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , on the 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier an Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ c@@ cl@@ in had been preserved .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole gift and as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 people were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs .
consider@@ ing only the patients who were treated for the first time in metast@@ atic breast cancer , there was no difference between medicines and survival for the first time in metast@@ atic breast cancer .
in contrast , patients showed that other treatments were obtained from their metast@@ atic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , that of Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may not be used in patients , feeding or even lower ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ id numbers in the blood at the beginning of the treatment .
the drug Committee for Human Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the first treatment could not be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el the pharmac@@ euticals must not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abraham &apos;s Bios@@ c@@ ience Limited registered for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane on the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy has been indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients with which the first line therapy is missing and not displayed for a standard Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ch@@ ut@@ ro@@ g@@ osity ( Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ine count &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or heavy sens@@ ory Neuro@@ path@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sen@@ sor@@ tic neuro@@ path@@ y degrees 3 , treatment can be broken down , until an improvement is reached 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ sier adap@@ tions in patients with mild to moderate im@@ pair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
no clinical trials were performed with im@@ paired ren@@ al function and there is currently no sufficient data to the recommendation of dos@@ sier adap@@ tions in patients with im@@ pair@@ ment of kid@@ ney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the use of children under 18 years due to sufficient data on harm@@ less@@ ness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked n@@ an@@ op@@ ar@@ particle form@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could represent another pharmaceutical characteristics as well as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should immediately be derived and an sympt@@ omatic treatment , and the patient should not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
patients should not be re@@ directed from Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles until the Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ere has risen again to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ elets are again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / ALT &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while clearly with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven in connection with ar@@ di@@ oto@@ x@@ icity , cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease did not un@@ common , especially in patients with the ear@@ liest Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in treatment or based on a heart@@ broken heart or lung disease .
if patients are treated according to the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and constant funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be practic@@ ed by pregnant or in@@ fer@@ ior age , which are no effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is imper@@ ish@@ able .

Male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is called , during and up to six months after the treatment no child is called .
Male patients should be advised before treatment over a sem@@ mak@@ al serv@@ ings since the therapy with the Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible in@@ fert@@ ility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause any side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inc@@ idents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , occurr@@ ing in the piv@@ ot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y was the most prominent landmark hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients ) and was fast rever@@ sible and dos@@ sier ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed with 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the side effects are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occas@@ ionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .

Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an An@@ tim@@ ic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ ingre@@ dient , which promotes the mer@@ ging of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tubes of tubes and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhib@@ iting their de@@ hydr@@ ation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a inhib@@ ition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it was proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial transport by the g@@ p @-@ 60 Alb@@ umin@@ u@@ ae ( secre@@ ted protein ac@@ idi@@ c rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) is a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the area of the tum@@ our .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two offensive studies and 454 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
this mul@@ tic@@ enter study was carried out in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which performed every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el treatment , either in the form of sol@@ vent containing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without medication ( N = 229 ) .
during the study , 64 % of patients had affected general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

ne@@ ur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity compared to Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who evaluated a peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y degree during therapy at a time during therapy .
the natural history of peri@@ ph@@ er Neuro@@ path@@ y on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatments has not been evaluated and continues to be unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30 - and 180 @-@ minute flight usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .

10 According to the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ ec@@ ation took part in multi@@ ph@@ as@@ ian ways .
the mean balance volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a wide range of trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or turn@@ out of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with an intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the clearance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was greater than the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after an sol@@ vent @-@ hal@@ e pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies the human liver mic@@ ros@@ ome and tissue is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is reported in first line to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 , -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ abol@@ ism .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same active ingre@@ dient ( also called &quot; reference medic@@ inal products ) . &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron levels in which in connection with a blood trans@@ f@@ usion complic@@ ations may occur in case of surgery a self @-@ blood donation is not possible , and during which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml are expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be conducted under the supervision of an doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kid@@ ney problems and in patients who wish to make a self @-@ ble@@ eding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to in@@ jected into a v@@ ene .
injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor if they have received an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al suff@@ iciency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries should always be at the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ or in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients suffer from the treatment to ensure that no iron consists of iron , and sh@@ ank of iron should be admin@@ istered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy or in patients with ren@@ al problems can be caused an@@ emia due to er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ iet@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thus avo@@ iding the body suff@@ ici@@ ently on the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ iet@@ in .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ iet@@ in is also used prior to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell which was put into a gene ( DNA ) which em@@ powered them to the formation of Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with sub@@ mission as an injection into a V@@ ene in a study of 4@@ 79 patients , associated with kid@@ ney problems caused by ren@@ al problems .
all patients participating in this study was in@@ jected at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene , before they were either performed on Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations between the beginning of the study and the reporting period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also put the results of a study in which the effects of previously in@@ jected Ab@@ se@@ amed with one of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was examined in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who were suffering from kid@@ ney problems caused by kid@@ ney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations of patients were maintained in the same extent as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients showed that E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o got an increase of 12.@@ 0 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which occas@@ ionally lead to symptoms of end@@ ze@@ ph@@ al@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sud@@ den , sl@@ anting , mig@@ rant stock and loss .
Ab@@ is@@ amed should not be applied in patients that may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or other of other components .
Ab@@ is@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for tre@@ ating kid@@ ney problems , as further studies are required to make sure that no allergic reactions are trig@@ gered .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that the medicine showed a comparable quality , safety and effic@@ acy @-@ profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in accordance with the provisions of the European Union .
the company , which is amed , will provide information staff for medical staff in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce medicines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to provide an author@@ isation for transportation from Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .

hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin @-@ target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with which the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) lie .
abnormal im@@ pregn@@ ation and fol@@ lic@@ ations may vary depending on age , gender and total disease last ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease by the doctor is necessary .
increase of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) for a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to vari@@ ability between patients occas@@ ionally , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations can be observed by patients or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ al concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin @-@ target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be att@@ empt@@ ed to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin comp@@ ilation ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ value exce@@ eds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or exce@@ eds the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ic 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the Epo@@ xy dose is 25 % lower .
the patients should be reliably monitored in time to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ ae@@ ul@@ z@@ ym@@ es .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher yield of less than patients , with which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher yield of less than patients , with which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .

abnormal im@@ pregn@@ ation and - fol@@ lic@@ ations may vary depending on age , gender and total disease last ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease by the doctor is necessary .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin @-@ target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be att@@ empt@@ ed to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin comp@@ ilation ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .

the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in consider@@ ation of the patient which should also consider specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a bigger orthop@@ e@@ dic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who maintain a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic surgical procedure , as they have increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ osis and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an under@@ lying car@@ cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease .
moreover , in the treatment with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with an output w@@ ast@@ age value of &gt; 13 g / dl provides an increased risk of post@@ operative and vas@@ cular events .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for tre@@ ating the following diseases : • Oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( one disease , who spr@@ inkl@@ ed the bones ) both after men@@ op@@ ause and for males .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture of frac@@ tures ( bone mar@@ ries ) , including patients who have suffered an in@@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes such as the disease ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease , which has changed the path@@ way of bone growth .
in addition , patients suffering from Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should have at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for a minimum of 10 days after treatment ; patients with tum@@ ble frac@@ ture should be taken before the first inf@@ usion of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection in one muscle .
symptoms of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , in the three days following the inf@@ usion of occurr@@ ing symptoms , such as fe@@ ver , muscle pain , fl@@ u @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for tre@@ ating the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingre@@ dient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data collection was used for Z@@ omet@@ a to evalu@@ ate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , and the number of sp@@ inal and r@@ ump frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over the age of 50 , who had suffered an injection frac@@ ture , and the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) .
main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was , whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( a enz@@ y@@ me that builds bones ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates was reduced in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ atri@@ ente ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo was reduced by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ction ) with that of plac@@ ebo was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with sc@@ ull frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients had one frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) in comparison to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are often less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be applied in patients that may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients suffer from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the risk of kid@@ ney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ at ( ab@@ norm@@ ality of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a presents declar@@ ations material for doctors that apply A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for tre@@ ating oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , as well as the medicine should be used , as well as a related material for patients who should refer to the side effects of the drug .

the combined results was a similar decrease of the pain strength and pain management in comparison with the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified by the end of the six @-@ month study of the treatment ( which were addressed to therapy ) , could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron patients who treated the therapeutic approach in 141 of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron patients , was observed in the average duration of follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid with 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ sier independent .
after this , the plasma level decreased rapidly at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
R@@ asch@@ es bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ian dis@@ appearance from the great circulation of half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ al@@ al elim@@ in@@ ational life period t ½ dg 146 hours .
the early formation phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ values ) pres@@ um@@ ably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and differenti@@ ation of the kid@@ neys .
during the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the dose admin@@ istered in ur@@ ine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ ability is independent of the dose of 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by sex , age , race , or body weight .
an extension of inf@@ usion of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration at 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma centr@@ ation against time ) .
a reduced cle@@ ver of met@@ abol@@ ised substances is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ liz@@ ed because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ liz@@ ed because they have a weak or not direct and / or ir@@ rever@@ sible , hydrogen @-@ dependent inhib@@ itor of P@@ 450@@ -
special patients ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Cle@@ arance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Cle@@ arance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Cle@@ arance , and amounted to a total of 64 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kid@@ ney function up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose @-@ adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
as for serious kid@@ ney function ( cre@@ atine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are required , no failure will be possible for this population .
ac@@ ute tox@@ icity The highest in@@ trac@@ al intra@@ ven@@ osis was 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
at studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended dose of human ex@@ position ) , admin@@ istered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application was determined by doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , in total 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , equivalent to the 75 @-@ minute intervals of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , equivalent to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , equivalent to the AU@@ C ) .
in long term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulative ex@@ position , the maximum of the intended human ex@@ position has been suff@@ ici@@ ently exceeded , the toxic effects of other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract and the liver , as well as intra@@ ven@@ ous injection methods .
the most common relation of studies with repeated treatment was a multip@@ lied primary sp@@ ong@@ i@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ y@@ se of the long bone in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a power and reflec@@ ting the pharmaceutical , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats there observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity of doses from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a sk@@ el@@ eton .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Consult@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained as the con@@ tribut@@ or to the human drug policy ( CH@@ MP ) to obtain regards to the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight @-@ dependent patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abe@@ tic medication ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medication ( dual therapy ) .
additionally , additionally to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) can be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ide or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fa drugs can be maintained , except for patients with hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body @-@ own ins@@ ulin can be improved better and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , thereby allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos were investig@@ ated in Tri@@ ple@@ as , in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa drugs , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cer@@ y hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value which suggest@@ s that the blood glucose levels of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg were lo@@ wered .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ t study the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fa drugs in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo was given to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin has been investig@@ ated in 289 patients , the acts given in addition to ins@@ ulin , decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0,14 % in the patients who also took plac@@ ebo .
the most common ad@@ verse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual acu@@ ity , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ an@@ aes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be applied in patients , which may react in sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ az@@ id@@ osis ( high level of acid ) - acid mirror ( blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( if used ) is used as an alternative to the standard treatment of met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for creating Ac@@ tos into the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to wh@@ it@@ ish , round , curved and carry on a page the markings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the label &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate , and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ sts or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. ear@@ liest heart attack or sympt@@ omatic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin to begin a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , and increases the dose in accordance with the lowest available rate .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or oil @-@ suff@@ iciency , particularly those with reduced cardi@@ ology reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and de@@ ma suff@@ iciency , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ zone is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ ovas@@ cular out@@ come study conducted with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been performed .
in this study , an increase in reports about con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased initial disease values ( ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of normal ) or with other signs of a liver illness , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ zone must not be used .
when ALT @-@ Spiegel are up to the 3 @-@ fold the limit of the norm range , the liver ym@@ es are soon to be inspec@@ ted as soon as possible .
if patient have developed symptoms that point on a he@@ pat@@ itis function , such as im@@ precise nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , upper abdominal pain , fatigue , app@@ et@@ ite and / or dark har@@ n , are to ver@@ ify the liver values .
the decision whether to continue the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ zone , should be managed by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ sier has been detected , which can be caused by ob@@ li@@ ations and in some cases associated with liquid re@@ tention .
as a result of a hem@@ oph@@ thal@@ ic acid , the mean reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ es ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ocr@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients with metast@@ ases ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and in@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ocr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitive dose consists of patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral @-@ triple or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ ing @-@ dependent hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
under the market launch of Th@@ i@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , including a occurr@@ ence or a deter@@ i@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic MA@@ KU@@ LA@@ Ö@@ DE@@ MS as a reduction of visual acu@@ ity was reported .
it is un@@ clear if there are direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , the possibility of a MA@@ KU@@ LA@@ Ö@@ DE@@ MS should be aware that the patient should report on dis@@ orders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a sum@@ ming analysis of reports from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture ratio was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fac@@ tions per 100 patient @-@ years with women who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .

in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was employed in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kid@@ ney problems were only 100 mg a day .
the main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients , their ur@@ inary acid levels in the blood in the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily had 120 mg of income in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .

clinical study results The effic@@ acy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two piv@@ ot@@ ics studies phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary effic@@ acy point was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly service records &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ atine study at the beginning of study ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ atine study at the start of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed significant significant regulation both for treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily for the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statist@@ ically significant reduction in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily for the treatment with the usual dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

reduction of the ser@@ um @-@ refle@@ ction mirror to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently main@@ tains over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um in@@ in@@ able values &gt; 1,5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl , 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al restri@@ ction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effic@@ acy of 40 patients with ren@@ al restri@@ ction ( i.e. hours ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary response point has been achieved at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um @-@ pop@@ ulations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kid@@ ney function and 55 % in group with severe kid@@ ney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with servo activities ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had up to study ( bas@@ eline ) a ser@@ um concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years collected data from the phase 3 showed that the permanent removal of the ser@@ um stands at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mol / l ) showed that less than 3 % of patients needed an treatment against a shift in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a shift ) .
this was associated with a reduction in no@@ vel@@ od@@ ine size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the G@@ icht@@ k@@ enti@@ s up to the year 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Arch@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma level ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma centr@@ ation period ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at after sub@@ mission is sim@@ pler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ si@@ propor@@ tional .
for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C is greater than the dos@@ ing propor@@ tional increase .
after taking a simple or multi@@ pler single doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage of ser@@ ad@@ ist concentration , if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is within the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma cutting assembly of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is about 99,@@ 2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentr@@ ating width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver mic@@ ros@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites are produced mainly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for tre@@ ating oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are incub@@ ated ) with women after men@@ op@@ ause , with which a risk of a low vitamin D mirror exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or influence of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take place until after the first meal of the day , at least 30 minutes after intake of the tablet , do not lie down .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already allowed separately in pharmac@@ euticals to comply with the European Union , data presented from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in order to demonstr@@ ate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D refle@@ ction .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who were used exclusively with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also provided data that that in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE contained Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose exactly the dose that is needed for prevent@@ ing a bone loss .
the most common ad@@ verse events observed ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the lack of movement such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ es ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( blood stress ) , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( val@@ er@@ al distur@@ b@@ ances ) , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( in@@ tox@@ icity ) , gro@@ w@@ l ( blin@@ king stomach ) as well as su@@ cking exposure .
for patients with persist@@ ent hyper@@ sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or other components may not be used for AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
it may not be applied in ill@@ nesses of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hyp@@ oc@@ al@@ c@@ emia ( low potassium level ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .
January 2007 the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a special approval for the use of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE approved in the European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the out@@ line of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only with water ( not filled with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or taking medic@@ inal products ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamins ) for the day
the following critics are exactly to be followed to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be sw@@ allowed after completion of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not cut the tablet into the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patient should not take place before the first meal of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after intake of the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tical Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or surgical procedures in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract but only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ itis , viol@@ ations of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al disease , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly were they were severe and required a hospital assignment ) .
the doctor should therefore point out attention to all signs and symptoms that are aimed at imp@@ acts of symptoms of end@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain at sw@@ allowing or retro@@ spec@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious ad@@ verse effects seems to be increased when the medicine does not take place properly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of those symptoms , apply on a mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing assign@@ ments should be passed to the patient and understood by patients ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in large clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was discovered , rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ i and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , among them some severe and with complic@@ ations , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is of the j@@ aw , usually reported in connection with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ el@@ itis ) in cancer patients , is mainly intra@@ ven@@ ously admin@@ istered to bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to give the hin@@ ts whether the ab@@ etting of a bis@@ phosph@@ ate therapy is di@@ min@@ ished in patients that reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is of j@@ aw .
the clinical assessment by the doctor &apos;s doctor is crucial for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instru@@ cted out of taking a tablet in the case of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning if they have noticed their goods .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the day .
other diseases , which im@@ pair the mineral exchange ( like vitamin D def@@ iciency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ id@@ ism ) , should also treat ad@@ ju@@ qu@@ ate prior to therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can im@@ pair the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific intervention trials were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together with a multitude of commonly prescribed medicines , without knowing clinical inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore should be used neither during pregnancy nor l@@ act@@ ating women .
animal welfare with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at have no evidence of direct access effects regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / gre@@ asy or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis of the oral surgery was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports origin@@ ate from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ ep@@ ati@@ es .
nevertheless the ser@@ um of ser@@ um calcium can be found up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mol / l ) and the ser@@ um @-@ phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at due to oral over@@ dose can act hyp@@ oc@@ al@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate and side @-@ effects in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract , as stomach up@@ set , gast@@ ro@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , gast@@ ritis or Ul@@ cer@@ a occur .

in severe cases , lack of hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ id@@ ism , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate and oste@@ o@@ al@@ az@@ ilia , weak@@ ness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie may result in an increased risk of lin@@ t@@ ances and bones in oste@@ op@@ or@@ otic persons .

in this study the daily gift from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new sp@@ ine correction to 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % to Pla@@ ze@@ bo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
reduction on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the mean or@@ ale bio@@ availability of 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after aw@@ ful fast@@ ing and two hours before recording a standardi@@ zed spring .
the bio@@ availability increased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken for half an hour before a standardi@@ zed breakfast .
in oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ est@@ u@@ ums , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or a drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times a day ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant change of the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

distinc@@ tion after the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , approximately 50 % of radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the ur@@ ine ex@@ cre@@ ted and little or not radio@@ activity was found in the barrels .
according to an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Cle@@ arance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and system@@ ic Cle@@ arance drops not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the ac@@ idi@@ c or basic transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that the differenti@@ ation of other medicines can be affected by this transport systems .

Adv@@ oc@@ raf is admin@@ istered up adult patients , where a kid@@ ney or liver is tran@@ spl@@ anted to prevent the tran@@ spl@@ ant of the tran@@ spl@@ ant organ through the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , results from a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients with kid@@ ney tran@@ splant@@ ation was presented , whereby the application of Adv@@ oc@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ port was compared .
General Indi@@ c@@ ator of effic@@ acy was the number of patients in which the tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ ts was added by a year ( e.g. by example , as often a new tran@@ spl@@ ant or a res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
moreover , further further studies on 119 patients with kid@@ ney tran@@ splant@@ ation were performed and examined in 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant and examined as Adv@@ oc@@ raf in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

only doctors that are familiar with immun@@ olog@@ ic therapy and treatment of tran@@ splant@@ ation patient should take de@@ men@@ tions or make changes in immun@@ os@@ ro@@ sive treatment .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ ts or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub or over@@ imm@@ u@@ pp@@ ings .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and related daily dose ; settings of form@@ ulation or reg@@ imes should be performed only under the control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative form@@ ulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate can be performed to ensure that system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us must be maintained .
the dosage of Adv@@ oc@@ raf was primarily based on the clinical assessment of pick @-@ sto@@ ols and toler@@ ability in individual cases and blood levels ( see below &quot; recommendations
after the conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks should be controlled by the chan@@ ge@@ over and over two weeks after the chan@@ ge@@ over .
in day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure was measured with both form@@ ulations , both for kid@@ ney and in @-@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients .
careful and repeated controls of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ king levels are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splant@@ ation under Adv@@ ag@@ raf , to ensure adequate substance ex@@ position in the direct inf@@ ant @-@ tran@@ splant@@ ation .
because tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ oc@@ raf Dos@@ age schem@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of patients in the first post@@ operative phase does not permit cor@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intra@@ ven@@ ously ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml ) can be initiated using a dose of ca .
duration of the application and suppression of tran@@ splant@@ ation must be maintained ; consequently the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression cannot be specified ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dos@@ ing recommendation - The proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of proph@@ yl@@ ac@@ ies the oral Adv@@ oc@@ raf therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift of the morning .
additional dose adap@@ tions can later be required , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us could change during stabil@@ ising the patient after tran@@ splant@@ ation .
dosage Me@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the graf@@ ts proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant therapy the oral Adv@@ ag@@ raf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg per day as a daily gift of the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age recommendation - Conver@@ ted from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ oc@@ raf If a tran@@ splant@@ ation is submitted twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf . thus , this conversion is obtained in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
kid@@ ney and liver tran@@ splant@@ ation After a chan@@ ge@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va on Adv@@ ag@@ raf once daily must start treatment with the recommended oral anti@@ al dose for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ splant@@ ation .
tran@@ splant@@ ation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a oral initi@@ als of 0.15 mg / kg / day to be taken during the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant rec@@ eivers : although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ oc@@ raf in a oral initi@@ ating patients of 0,@@ 10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ ed patients in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in a oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tions in special patient @-@ groups with reduced liver function to main@@ taining blood pressu@@ res in the target@@ ed area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function dis@@ orders of the dose .
patients with limited ren@@ al function requ@@ iring no effect on the pharmaceutical industry of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose of dose is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ oto@@ x@@ ic Pot@@ enti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kid@@ ney function ( including a regular determination of the calcium cre@@ ad@@ ine , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ ap@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ ine volume ) is recommended .
transition from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ oc@@ raf In the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine based on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on Tal@@ king levels in the whole blood The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of folding and toler@@ ability in individual case taking whole blood th@@ um@@ met@@ us @-@ levels .
it is advised of frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after tran@@ splant@@ ation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during the therapy .
blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be modified after the conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , Dos@@ ing adaptation , amend@@ ments of immun@@ ro@@ cos@@ ine therapy or even if the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ full blood concentration could be controlled ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ oc@@ raf is a medicine with a low clearance , adjust@@ ments of the dose may require several days until the ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the mirror is not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ mud levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the blood flow in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ant , usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml , and em@@ brac@@ ed patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the following ex@@ cre@@ ational therapy of liver , kid@@ ney and cardi@@ ac tran@@ splant@@ ation were usually used in the range of blood concentr@@ ations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this resulted in serious ad@@ verse events , including tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ or or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and related daily dose ; settings of form@@ ulation or reg@@ imes should be performed only under the control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ splant@@ ation , which proved to be patient in other immune br@@ oth treatment , are not yet a clinical data for ret@@ ar@@ tic@@ ulated form@@ ulation of Adv@@ oc@@ raf .
for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ splant@@ ation in adult cardi@@ ac graf@@ ts and graf@@ ts received no clinical data for ret@@ ar@@ tic@@ ulated form@@ ulation in Adv@@ oc@@ raf .
due to possible inter@@ actions , who can lead to a down@@ fall of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ cular diseases in blood and a decline of clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , taking herbal medic@@ inal agents ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , taking some other plant remedi@@ es during treatment with Adv@@ oc@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a very careful monitoring of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentr@@ ations on blood , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be sub@@ jected among such circumstances on such circumstances .
in rare cases , it was considered under Pro@@ gra@@ f as a Car@@ di@@ omy@@ opathy called the chamber or se@@ pt@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ phy which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ oc@@ raf .
more factors which increase the risk of such clinical inter@@ ference are an already existing cardi@@ ovas@@ cular , high blood pressure , kid@@ ney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ load and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ si@@ va the influence of sunlight or UV light should be reduced by suitable clothing or use of any solar protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , lack of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and long@@ suffering , should have a radi@@ cal investigation ( e.@@ g .
because Adv@@ oc@@ raf enc@@ ud@@ dle , ret@@ ar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , L@@ act@@ ase Def@@ iciency or Gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ ign special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal products that are known as inhib@@ itors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence met@@ abol@@ ism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently reduce blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels in the same time gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A met@@ abol@@ ism , to monitor and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose associated with exc@@ essive concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction of interaction has been associated with An@@ tim@@ y@@ cot such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and associated with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid @-@ Anti@@ bi@@ otic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ease ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study showed that the increase of blood levels is mainly caused by the increased bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to inhib@@ ition of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal contam@@ ination .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as in ac@@ ute rep@@ ay@@ ment actions , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on met@@ abol@@ ism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors ; therefore the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines prescribed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abol@@ ism .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII con@@ ditional , con@@ gen@@ ital hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ema ) .
the dose and frequency of application apply to whether Adv@@ ate is used for tre@@ ating ble@@ eding or prevention of ble@@ eding problems .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII def@@ iciency , which causes blood co@@ ag@@ ulation problems like ble@@ eding in joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology :
it is produced by a cell where a gene has been recorded ( DNA ) which they em@@ powered on the formation of human natural human VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differ@@ ently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate leu@@ oph@@ ilia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical procedures was investig@@ ated .
in the main study , the effic@@ acy of Adv@@ ant@@ ages in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood levels were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common ad@@ verse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fe@@ ver ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate should not be applied in patients that may possibly be exc@@ essive ( allergic ) against human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , Mouse , or Ham@@ ster@@ protein , or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to support the adv@@ ent of adv@@ ances in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of the substit@@ ution therapy according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ Mang@@ els , after the place and the extent of ble@@ eding and the clinical condition of the patient .
for the following mor@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor of VIII ( in % of the norm , or in I.@@ U. / dl ) will drop under the relevant plasma level .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat , until pain and ac@@ ute im@@ pair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is over for the patient .
during treatment course , for controlling the dose and the frequency of in@@ jec@@ tions , a reasonable determination of the factor VIII plasma was credited .
individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo repair and exhibit different semi @-@ value .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis appoint@@ ments in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight in the interval of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VIII plasma can not be achieved or if the blood counts is not ruled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary for an inhib@@ itor .
in patients with high inhib@@ itors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the transfer speed should be set to patients , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti@@ bodies ( inhib@@ itors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in tre@@ ating patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhib@@ itors are always op@@ ted against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G immune glo@@ bul@@ ins , an@@ thes@@ da units in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of inhib@@ itors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 hours of exposure to the largest is and of genetic and other factors .
in treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure systems and an@@ am@@ ne@@ ural c@@ hib@@ itor development , after the chan@@ ge@@ over from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occur of ( lower ) inhib@@ itors was observed .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of h@@ amm@@ oph@@ ilia A in women , there are no experience in the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and l@@ act@@ ation .

based on the initial approval of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has continued to be regarded as a positive rating , but considered a positive consider@@ ation that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely over@@ seen :
therefore , CH@@ MP has decided upon approval from ADV@@ A@@ TE , which is required a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation holder should apply for another 6 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited , the Committee for Human Use Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , announced that the company receives his request for the adv@@ ent of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the sof@@ ten ( t@@ issues that combines other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and support ) of it .
it is a sort of virus that was gene@@ tically modified it is a gene on the body of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which is so al@@ tered that there is no copies of itself and cannot dis@@ solve infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ours and should enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein which is made out of which is not def@@ ective in the human body by the p@@ 53 gene , is usually admin@@ istered to restor@@ ing damaged DNA and to kill the cells , if the DNA can not be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 % does not work properly , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share .
data provided data from a study with a patient prior to Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the field of sub@@ str@@ ation , in bones and brain .
once the CH@@ MP had examined the answers to the given questions , some questions were still un@@ solved .
based on the basis of initial submitted documents , CH@@ MP is published on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours brings advantages to the patient .
the committee dist@@ ort concerns relating to the medicine in the body , the type of administration and safety of the medicine .
moreover , the company had not suff@@ ici@@ ently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner , and that it is neither necessary for the environment that is in contact with patients .
the company , not knowing the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients is currently studying clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; al@@ tered drug release means &quot; means that the tablets are combined so that one of the effective components is instantly released and the other slowly is released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seas@@ onal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fe@@ as@@ ibility ) , through an allerg@@ y against pol@@ len ( nas@@ al trails ) in patients with nas@@ al sw@@ ival sw@@ elling ( c@@ log@@ ged nose ) .
in adults and teen@@ agers over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ at@@ aze is twice daily one tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the treatment duration should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose mu@@ c@@ ous ( c@@ log@@ ged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be found on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main effects of the sever@@ ity of the fo@@ ils were principal sympt@@ omatic symptoms resulting from the patient prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a di@@ ary and gave a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in case of cont@@ empl@@ ation of all bre@@ eds of the nose , the patient reported that Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , compared with the decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in the patients with pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous was considered , the patients showed an increase of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who suffer dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Aer@@ in@@ at@@ se ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , mouth@@ wash , di@@ zz@@ iness ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , gon@@ i@@ osity , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , ins@@ om@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and ner@@ vo@@ us@@ ness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be used in patients who possibly out@@ emp@@ ire ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or any of the other components against ad@@ ren@@ al drugs or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine to treat allerg@@ ies ) are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ duce may not be applied in patients , suffering from hyper@@ tension ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ) , or already having a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval to the Company SP Europe for transport@@ ing Aer@@ in@@ o.com throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , if sw@@ allow to sw@@ allow ( i.e. without them to break or to che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should be used due to the lack of data on harm@@ less@@ ness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) should not be applied for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after deduc@@ ting the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days , since long term use the activity of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine with time .
after the decline of pig@@ s in upper re@@ spir@@ atory acts , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze Pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains the drug is also associated with patients who are treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( Mao ) inhib@@ itor or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is at@@ tribut@@ able to the alph@@ abetical activity of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in , Per@@ go@@ lid , v@@ int@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other di@@ kon@@ v@@ ines , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , Oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been examined for this patient data , and data is not enough to submit relevant recommendations to dose .
safety and effic@@ acy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kid@@ ney or liver working inter@@ ference . the data is not enough to chat messages to dose .
the patient must be informed about tre@@ ating hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ es or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ mic dis@@ orders , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening the head@@ aches ) .
at the following care groups : • Pati@@ ents at digital@@ is • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm dis@@ orders • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hy@@ m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the history of diabetes , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the history of history .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is taking place at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise prevent positive reactions from indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were admin@@ istered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma level of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
with the results of the psych@@ iat@@ ric tests , no significant differences between the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the plac@@ ebo could be noted , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were taken alone or with alcohol .
the enz@@ ym@@ es of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible En@@ z@@ ym has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D6 was not inhib@@ ited nor neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhib@@ itor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
however , the in@@ convenience of applying Aer@@ in@@ at@@ se during pregnancy is not backed up , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ anc@@ ies , however , no increase in frequency of de@@ form@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since the studies are not always transferred to humans and in the basis of vas@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in characteristics of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in should not be applied to aer@@ in@@ aze in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clar@@ ified that in very rare cases , it may occur in very rare cases that may lead to im@@ pair@@ ment of traffic noise or the ability to serve presses .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S de@@ pression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , com@@ a , cardi@@ ovas@@ cular disease ( ins@@ om@@ nia , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , Kon@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ies .

these include both the inhib@@ ition of anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human master@@ cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhib@@ ition of expression of the expression P @-@ S@@ elek@@ tronic on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
at an adult dose with adult , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement ranges of the air performance including the amplif@@ ication of sub@@ jec@@ tive g@@ rief or the tasks associated with the fly .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , increased frequency of g@@ rief compared to plac@@ ebo was determined by the recommended dose of 5 mg .
the oral application of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sym@@ pa@@ thetic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S creation .
1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years were attended with seas@@ onal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ duce tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine prot@@ agon@@ ist effic@@ acy of Aer@@ in@@ ely tablets , measured by the overall value for the symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al sw@@ o@@ idal sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effic@@ acy of Aer@@ in@@ aze pills , with regard to the floating @-@ sw@@ elling effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ ese pills showed no significant differences in particular according to gender , age or ethnic in@@ dis@@ sen@@ i@@ ority .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ec@@ table in the plasma within 30 minutes after administration .

if allergic r@@ hin@@ itis succeeded when the results of all studies have been studied with 5 mg Aer@@ ius , an average decrease of the symp@@ tom scores ( symp@@ tom points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease from 12 to 26 % in patients who were given a plac@@ ebo .
in both studies with ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease of the symp@@ tom counts with Aer@@ ius 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo was treated with plac@@ ebo .
Aer@@ ius may not be applied in patients who may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or other components .
from January 2001 , the European Commission granted a approval to the Company SP Europe for transport@@ ing aer@@ onau@@ ts in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to prevent the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
there are restricted experience of clinical trials to util@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the hi@@ ther@@ to of the disease and , according to the un@@ read@@ able of the symptoms , it should be res@@ umed .
persist@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended for patients during the allerg@@ y period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found during clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole may also be given ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study at the same time taking of Aer@@ us and alcohol , the most powerful effect of alcohol has not increased ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clar@@ ified that in very rare cases , it may cause im@@ pair@@ ment of traffic noise or the ability to serve presses .
clinical trials in various indic@@ ations including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with Aer@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly manif@@ ested side effects , more common than in plac@@ ebo was ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , oral @-@ dr@@ yers ( 0.8 % ) , and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 y@@ outh@@ ful patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients who have been treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and with 6.9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( n@@ inth clinical dose ) were admin@@ istered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhib@@ ition of anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human master@@ cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhib@@ ition of expression of expression P @-@ sel@@ ector for end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells .
in a clinical study with multi @-@ gy@@ ms , in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was admin@@ istered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clinical @-@ relevant cardi@@ ovas@@ cular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has been given a dose of 45 mg daily ( a n@@ inth of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ TC interval .
in a single dos@@ sier study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement ranges of the air performance including the amplif@@ ication of sub@@ jec@@ tive g@@ rief or the tasks associated with the flies .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , aer@@ ius was effective in relie@@ ving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching of the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enn@@ ial , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may be divided into an allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persist@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as is shown using the total amount of quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire on the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ stim@@ ul@@ itis , Aer@@ ius reduces sever@@ ely affected by seas@@ onal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investig@@ ated specifically for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology im@@ bal@@ med the ae@@ ti@@ ology in different forms , and chronic patients can be sim@@ pl@@ a@@ ided .
since the hist@@ amine therapy is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ul@@ ous diseases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is expected to improve such symptoms of the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guid@@ ances .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , Aer@@ ius was effective in the improvement of pre@@ dat@@ ors and the number of h@@ ives by the end of the first dose of dos@@ sier .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine , from the study .
an improvement in sug@@ ary gain by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with Aer@@ ius reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax@@ y , as measured through a 4 @-@ point scale to evalu@@ ating the variables .
in an pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with general seas@@ onal hin@@ itis -@@ population was comparable , with 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was achieved .
there are no connection points for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible En@@ z@@ ym has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D6 was not inhib@@ ited nor neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhib@@ itor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ sier study with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ ched , cal@@ orie @-@ oriented breakfast ) did not work on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the clinical trials listed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ in ad@@ in , with a compar@@ ative degree of ex@@ position of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quant@@ itative differences in regards to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .

Aer@@ ius can be taken independent of meals , on relie@@ ving symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persist@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the resulting doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis must be caused by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data is required to support a treatment of inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous r@@ hin@@ itis with Aer@@ ius .
apart from excl@@ usion of upper re@@ spir@@ atory infections , or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ al@@ ies should play a role in the diagnosis of the An@@ am@@ history , physical exam@@ inations and appropriate laboratory and skin studies .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abol@@ ism , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in restricted and experienced a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of Aer@@ ius Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted met@@ abol@@ ism , is identical to the children that normally met@@ abol@@ ish .

in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study at the same time taking of Aer@@ us tablets and alcohol , the most powerful effect of alcohol has not increased ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the total number of side @-@ side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar with the Aer@@ ius sy@@ rup group like the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents in various indic@@ ations including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with Aer@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( n@@ inth clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 years received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children , the effic@@ acy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated in adults to the population population extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated .
in a clinical study with multi @-@ gy@@ ms in adults and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily was used daily for 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically substanti@@ al cardi@@ ovas@@ cular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adults and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the n@@ inth of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ TC interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents have no increased frequency of g@@ rief compared to plac@@ ebo .
for a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , Aer@@ us tablets were conducted at adults and yo@@ ungst@@ ers in clinical trials to no im@@ pair@@ ment of Psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies on adults it came from the simultaneous use of alcohol either to gain alcohol @-@ induc@@ ed loss of power even in increasing the dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and el@@ derly people to protect against fl@@ u , which is caused by the strain of the influ@@ enza A virus ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ine that could cause a strain of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus which might cause future pan@@ dem@@ ic .
a influ@@ enza pan@@ dem@@ ic breaks down when a new strain of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus is re@@ cre@@ eps from man to humans , because people still does not have imm@@ unity ( no protection ) by contrast .
after sub@@ mission of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system contained in the vacc@@ ine contained in the vacc@@ ine than &quot; physical &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in a contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this tribe faster anti@@ body .
the mem@@ bran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogn@@ izes the human body as a body ) and is used as a component of the vacc@@ ine .
an inspection of some of the study sites prove that the study was not performed according to the &quot; Good Clinical Practice . &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this means the scope of the clinical data base to evalu@@ ate the safety of the vacc@@ ine is not to meet the requirements of the EMEA to pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vacc@@ ines .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs to treat adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immune def@@ iciency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are caused by the acquired immun@@ o@@ def@@ iciency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot sw@@ allow the capsules directly as a solution for entry , but this cannot be taken along with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
if the doctor should only be addressed if the doctor has examined , which has taken an@@ tivir@@ al drugs of the patient before , and the prob@@ ability that virus will respond to medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based upon body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al pharmac@@ euticals to the HIV @-@ amount in blood and prevents them at low level .
Aids can not he@@ al , however , the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of AIDS @-@ connected infections and diseases .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with Prot@@ ease .
the anti @-@ oxid@@ ant R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir intensi@@ fied drugs A@@ gener@@ ase was compared to 206 adults who had previously used Prot@@ ease In@@ hib@@ ians with other Prot@@ ease .
main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ rep@@ ell@@ ent centr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ al load ) , or change in the vir@@ al load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not had any Prot@@ ease in patients , after 48 weeks , more patients had a vir@@ al load under 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ av@@ ir .
in children the vir@@ al load was also reduced to the vir@@ al load , however , from the children who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ ease was very few in the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ ease ehem@@ iah , use R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir to intensi@@ fied the vir@@ al load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other Prot@@ ease of treatment :
in the patients with HIV , the against four other Prot@@ ecting Wall was stable , along with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , it came to a stronger decrease of the vir@@ al load after four weeks as compared with the patients who continued their hi@@ ther@@ to further premi@@ ums :
the most common ad@@ verse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( blast@@ ing ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 gener@@ ative may not be applied in patients that may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir or one of other components .
in addition , char@@ ity may not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement for treatment of de@@ pression ) or medic@@ inal products , which are de@@ emed to be harmful in high concentr@@ ations in blood health prec@@ au@@ ctions .
as with other medicines for HIV in patients who are using asp@@ ir@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
in conclusion to the conclusion that the benefits of human dental medicine ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al pharmac@@ euticals to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs for treatment of treated HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
in general , the committee is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , but the committee introduced that the benefits of renewable av@@ ir in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients who had not been taken of Prot@@ ease .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; since the date of author@@ ization of scientific reasons only a limited information .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited to conven@@ i@@ ently appro@@ ve A@@ gener@@ ase and the entire European Union .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al pharmac@@ euticals to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ ease ( PI ) treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules should be admin@@ istered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ an boost from Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir along with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir should be made consider@@ ing the individual vir@@ al resistance patterns and pre@@ treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir as a solution to take up 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , as@@ general capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ag@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir twice daily along with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
2 If A@@ generic Ch@@ ase are used without the rein@@ forcement of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( Boo@@ ph@@ olster@@ ed ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ag@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effic@@ acy and safety of renewable energy in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir or other Prot@@ ease in children were not examined .
gener@@ ase is not recommended for use with children under 4 years , due to the lack of data relating to the error and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily with a heavy liver function in adult patients and in patients with severe liver function on 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use should be done in patients with mild or more severe liver working inter@@ ference in patients with severe liver working inter@@ ference ( see section 4.3 ) .
asp@@ ec@@ ase may not be given to pharmac@@ euticals in addition to a small therapeutic width and in addition to sub@@ str@@ ate the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , due to risk reduction in plasma centr@@ ations and a di@@ min@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that as@@ general or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy not lead to an healing of HIV infection , and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infection or other complic@@ ations of an HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with au@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent HIV to other contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
usually A@@ generic Cap@@ sules should be used together with low doses of r@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who are treated to chronic he@@ pat@@ itis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , increased risk for severe liver effects with potenti@@ ally fatal course .
for the case of an equal an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of he@@ pat@@ itis B or C please read the relevant professional information of this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active he@@ pat@@ itis show an increased frequency of liver working inter@@ ference using an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ative and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , is not recommended that the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weighs system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ oster@@ one effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the Low @-@ ren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because the comp@@ ilation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ atin is dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a con@@ current sub@@ mission of su@@ ro@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ atine due to increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen is not recommended .
4 For some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as carb@@ am@@ a@@ zep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of drugs .
in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , as@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective for a reduced plasma level of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abol@@ ism inter@@ actions with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , but the information cannot be sufficient for the nature of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the patients should therefore be monitored to op@@ pressed det@@ ective symptoms , especially if it also has low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity of the A@@ generic solution , this form@@ ulation should be con@@ tra to children under an age of four years and should be used with caution regarding certain other patient groups .
gener@@ ase should be placed at the duration of 5 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including Prot@@ ease , was reported via the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy are necessary , with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as persist@@ ent anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders associated with the associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders .
in ug@@ h@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , reports were treated with Prot@@ ease and reports about an increase of ble@@ eding , including spont@@ aneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ ws .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ect at the time of introduction to an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) which leads to severe clinical conditions or deter@@ i@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multif@@ ak@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ti@@ ology ( including use of anti @-@ anti@@ qu@@ ides , alcohol use , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , were reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase may not simultaneously own a low therapeutic width , and sub@@ str@@ ate the sub@@ str@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D6 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width of au@@ gener@@ ase using R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir must not be combined with drugs , whose active ingredients are mainly used by CY@@ P2@@ D6 and are related to higher plasma screens with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % decrease in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir who can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance to resistance .
an att@@ empt@@ ed plasma level caused by a dos@@ ing increase of other prot@@ ec@@ ease inhib@@ itors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , were observed very often un@@ wanted effects of the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , John &apos;s ser@@ um mirror can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient takes over St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir@@ mirror and if possible to check the vir@@ al load and the cur@@ rant .
a dose of dose for any of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ av@@ ir is admin@@ istered along with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see also the fav@@ or below ) .
508 % increase , if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) increases in combination with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice daily , which indicate the effic@@ acy and safety of this treatment diagram .
52 % reduced if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) .
the C@@ min Values of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) were taken twice daily in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended , as the effic@@ acy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed using di@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Did@@ an@@ os@@ in , but is advised due to the ant@@ az@@ ide component of Did@@ an@@ os@@ in and in at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ az@@ ida below ) .
for this reason an dose of dose invol@@ vement in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) is not necessary .
treatment with the fav@@ or in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir is not recommended because the ex@@ position of both Prot@@ ease of reti@@ rement would result .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other Prot@@ ease and existing limited data can be avoided , that you might reduce the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , be careful , because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be careful because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level could be less effective .
if these medicines can be applied together , caution is careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as providing accurate forecast of the combination of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
the simultaneous effect of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at 193 % and therefore a rise of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in associated side effects .
when it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in along with au@@ gener@@ ase is to be admin@@ istered to decrease the dose of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is required for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic studies with renewable in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma level of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir with 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day resulted in increasing the increase of C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day in comparison to the value , which was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhib@@ itors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with gener@@ ative effects , possibly inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be combined in toxic reactions which are monitored by this medicine if they are used in combination with ag@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data from other protective hib@@ itors it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ az@@ ida could not be taken at the same time as ren@@ gener@@ ase because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ b@@ ances .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ kon@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enz@@ ym@@ oma ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ am@@ a@@ zep@@ ine ) , can lead to am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir at a lo@@ wering of the plasma level of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
the ser@@ um concentration of calcium @-@ channel block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ lem@@ pin , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin , n@@ if@@ edi@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase 10 by am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , thus avo@@ iding the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous use of renewable energy can increase their plasma level and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors in combination side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual acu@@ ity and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study conducted in R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ at plasma level was significantly increased , while the end@@ ogen@@ eous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous product is not recommended with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ oster@@ one effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itor , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ su@@ atine , whose hydrogen change is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are exp@@ ecting to be exp@@ ecting at the time period of the plasma level .
since plasma level increases this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itor to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended .
it is recommended to see a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations until stabil@@ ize the mir@@ rors , since the plasma level of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in the same time gift from Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral hal@@ az@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , during the simultaneous use of gener@@ ative mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous use of local Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am with other Prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors can point out on a possible rise in the plasma level of Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am around the 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given together with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , the patients should therefore be monitored to op@@ pressed sympt@@ omatic symptoms , especially if it also has low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
due to the low reliability of historic compar@@ is@@ ons , no recommendation can be given as if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is not given at the same time as Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is admin@@ istered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
at the same time gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or gain of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , therefore , alternative methods are recommended to contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ ypt@@ il@@ in ) is recommended by the same @-@ term gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ Algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I / I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with an increasing phenomen@@ al resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ er@@ av@@ ir , with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir and a reduced prob@@ ability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
concl@@ usions on the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation pattern may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to make the results of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically valid@@ ated phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ative systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for the activity of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients with Prot@@ ease In@@ resistant insulation .
to distri@@ bute the diagnostic resistance tests , clin@@ ically proven hydraulic @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir associated data resi@@ ded against R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ av@@ ir , Nel@@ fin@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir remains generally received .
currently data is currently used for cross resistance between Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and other Prot@@ ease for all 4 Fos@@ car@@ ren@@ av@@ ir Resist@@ enz@@ pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not pre @-@ treated patients , with a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( three of 25 ins@@ ulating materials ) , In@@ din@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 ins@@ ulator ) , Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 ins@@ ulating materials ) , and Tip@@ ran@@ av@@ ir / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( four of 24 ins@@ ulating materials ) .
in contrast , Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir re@@ tains its activity against some other protective hib@@ itors of ins@@ ulating products ; the receipt of this activity seems to be depending on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of an fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which can affect the subsequent treatment .
the proof of effic@@ acy of asp@@ ec@@ ology in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized study ( 600 mg twice daily ) along with R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ sid@@ analogue ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , pre@@ domin@@ antly with lower R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
one hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to the gener@@ ase , at least one PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis did not determine the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the vir@@ al load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma for 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ disease threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effic@@ acy of un@@ born A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV inf@@ all children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ generic solution has been studied for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily . the sur@@ plus of the patients were 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI was at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) along with au@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Bas@@ ed on this data should be considered in consider@@ ation with PI for children to benefit from the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ used &quot; renewable energies .
after oral administration , the medium duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir are about 1 to 2 hours for each capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for C@@ max , reduced by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) was admin@@ istered along with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir 12 hours after application ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ lic@@ ated by the food intake , although the in@@ tim@@ ely dietary intake influences the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent volume of distribution is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be produced to a large distribution volume as well as an im@@ paired reti@@ ration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir from the blood circulation in the tissue .
this change direc@@ ts to a decrease of the total concentration in the plasma , whereby the amount of in@@ ju@@ red am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ fert@@ ile Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir is constant , the percentage of free active components during the dos@@ ing interval gra@@ v@@ ated in the region of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore medicines to be induc@@ ed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhib@@ it or sub@@ str@@ ate a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution , if they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir exposure as in adults with an dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ min@@ av@@ ir is made from the solution 14 % less organic than from the capsules ; therefore , as@@ general solution and re@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ grams base .
also the ren@@ al Cle@@ arance of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir is neg@@ lig@@ ible , therefore the effect of an kid@@ ney function should be reduced to the elim@@ ination of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
this therapy schem@@ es lead to Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir plasma cent@@ red for those who have taken in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir twice daily without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
in long term studies , with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir to mice and rats occurred in male animals , the pat@@ ron@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas of dos@@ ages based on the 2.0 @-@ mouth ( mice ) of the ex@@ position on the human being , after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the creation of the he@@ pat@@ ron@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ omas were not yet resol@@ ved and the relev@@ ance of that observed effects in human beings is un@@ clear .
however , from the present Ex@@ position data on humans , both from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic use , however , few hin@@ ts for the ass@@ um@@ ption of a clinical ratio of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mice symptoms of rats and chrom@@ os@@ ome @-@ err@@ ation test to human peri@@ pher@@ al l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic .
this tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical daily routine using A@@ ST , ALT and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical studies , no significant tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of au@@ gener@@ ase caused by the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity studies , which were treated at the age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality , both in control and with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir .
at a system@@ ic plasma ex@@ position , significantly higher ( rats ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage at humans were observed , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor sk@@ el@@ eton changes were observed on a delayed development .
24 If A@@ generic Ch@@ ase are used without the rein@@ forcement of R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( ph@@ olster@@ ed ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ag@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be done in patients with a weak or mild liver working with caution , for patients with severe liver working inter@@ ference ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as carb@@ am@@ a@@ zep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cyc@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of drugs .
gener@@ ase should be set at duration 27 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic dis@@ orders .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % decrease in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir who can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance to resistance .
508 % increase , if R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) increases in combination with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min Values of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ av@@ ir + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) were taken twice daily in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended , as the effic@@ acy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with the fav@@ or in combination with am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir is not recommended because the ex@@ position of both Prot@@ ease of reti@@ rement would result .
if these medicines can be applied together , caution is careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as providing accurate forecast of the combination of am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir and R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din .
when it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in along with au@@ gener@@ ase is to be admin@@ istered to a reduction of the dose of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is required for this .

in a clinical study conducted in R@@ it@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ at plasma level was significantly increased , while the end@@ ogen@@ eous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
at the same time gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or gain of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg Eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ av@@ ir by 22 % .

to apply with Al@@ dar@@ a &apos;s disease and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a in the gen@@ ital area , Al@@ dar@@ a is up to a maximum of 16 weeks three times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell cases , the cream has lasted for six weeks , during one or two week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is thin before bed@@ spread di@@ lu@@ ous to the skin areas , that makes it sufficient for a long time ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before they are washed .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingre@@ dient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies at 9@@ 23 patients with warning in the gen@@ ital sector for 16 weeks .
the main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients with complete sanc@@ tion of patients treated . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also treated at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two trials and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo was either daily or five times a week .
main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients with complete absence of tum@@ ors to twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . in all four major studies the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a were treated with Al@@ dar@@ a &apos;s patients , but only 3 % to 18 % were treated with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips or hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take up generally during treatment or reactions , after compl@@ eting the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme .
if due to the dis@@ comfort of patients or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , treatment of treatment can be made up of several days .
the clinical result of the therapy can be judged after the treatment of the treated skin for about 12 weeks after the treatment .
there are currently no data relating to long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after treatment , should be evaluated in su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ously bas@@ al cell cancer other suitable therap@@ ies .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experience prior to treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that at large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) lower chance of response to the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ric@@ ots on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose , or the ears or at the lip area within the lip area .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses to anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the arms and hands will not support the effectiveness in this application , so such application is not recommended .
local skin reaction is often occurr@@ ing , but these reactions take out normally within the therapy of intensity or after removing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions can cause large un@@ eas@@ iness or very strong , the treatment can be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study emerg@@ es that patients with more than 8 AC@@ - les@@ ions have reduced total healing rate as patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .

the assessment of clinical evidence shows that there were five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme very often severe er@@ y@@ them@@ ed ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) and severe crus@@ ades ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials related to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment of treatment or in the surrounding area .
the great unique or@@ ale intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 sach@@ ets , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ alg@@ ia and fe@@ ver .
the clin@@ ically significant side effect that occurred after several or@@ ic doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , system@@ ic concentr@@ ations of Alp@@ ha@@ inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 piv@@ otal Phase 3 effic@@ acy studies could be shown that the effic@@ acy in regards to a complete sanc@@ tion of fig cases at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy is clearly superior to plac@@ ebo treatment over 16 weeks .
at 60 % of the patients suffering from I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therap@@ ies the fig war@@ ts were completely healed ; this was in case of 20 % of the patients with plac@@ ebo patients ( 95 % CI ) .
full sanc@@ tion was achieved in 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of the plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) .
the effic@@ acy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was investig@@ ated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .

the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal system@@ ic incl@@ usion of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream into the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed with three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentr@@ ations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and ru@@ sted 0,1 , 0,2 and 1.6 ng / ml during use in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 d@@ ents ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ term after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this shows an extended re@@ tention of the medicine in the skin .
data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od had to be low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ diseases skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was comparable to that with healthy adult and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or su@@ perf@@ ic@@ iel@@ ent bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the diagnosis of patients with as@@ sured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ char@@ id@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase Def@@ iciency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( Gly@@ cos@@ amine og@@ ly@@ c@@ ane , G@@ ag ) are not dis@@ man@@ t@@ led and therefore accum@@ ulated in most organs in the body and to compens@@ ate them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , rigid joints , the movements g@@ low , di@@ min@@ ished lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done at a hospital or hospital with repe@@ ating devices , and the patients need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , primarily the safety of the medicine was investig@@ ated , however , it was also examined by its effectiveness ( in terms of reduced G@@ ag concentr@@ ations in ur@@ ine and in terms of the liver .
in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me experienced the G@@ ag @-@ concentr@@ ations in ur@@ ine by approximately 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , abdominal pain , r@@ ins@@ alg@@ ia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fe@@ ver and reactions to inf@@ usion .
very common ad@@ verse events in patients under five years have increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fe@@ ver and sho@@ ot@@ ings .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may react in patients who may react very sensitive ( allergic ) to av@@ on@@ id@@ ase or other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year all new information which may be known , ver@@ tically and modif@@ ying this summary if necessary .
the manufacturers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observed Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in relation to inf@@ usion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. and for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ y@@ me therapy with as@@ sured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ char@@ id@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase Def@@ iciency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h may be increased when the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effic@@ acy of algae in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients , no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kid@@ ney or liver disease is not determined , and for these patients , no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any related side effects , during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be physi@@ cally monitored , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be provided in a reasonable clinical environment in the re@@ cre@@ ational equipment for medical emerg@@ encies .
because of the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients of Ig@@ G anti@@ body produce anti@@ bodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience on the recovery of treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretical increased risk of relation to a inter@@ relation of treatment carefully .
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tic ) to minim@@ ise the potential occurr@@ ence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of light or heavy inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen was aimed and / or reduction of the inf@@ usion rate on half of the inf@@ usion rate .
in case of a single , serious inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are down@@ wards , a treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
inf@@ usion can decrease the inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction was re@@ signed .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Pro@@ c@@ ain , as a potenti@@ ally risk of inter@@ ference using in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or in@@ direct harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / o@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is exposed to new@@ bor@@ ns that are exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase about breast milk , is recommended to satisfy during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
in clinical studies , the effects of clinical studies have been reported primarily as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which was observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
ad@@ verse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and after having been observed in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 up to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ con@@ ditional invol@@ vement in the upper air@@ ways and in the pre@@ history , heavy reactions take out , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing al@@ ges@@ ic and fac@@ ial zones ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted pharmaceutical actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were reported during a ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with pre@@ domin@@ antly severe slow@@ ing up and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ plan , whereby it came to a Ser@@ o@@ Converter within 3 months with a severe slow@@ down form ( average after 26 days , over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a current exit from the study ) were reported on 13 / 45 patients with an investig@@ ational anti@@ bodies ( RI@@ P ) Ass@@ ay re@@ plac@@ eable anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients , with whom there were never too Ser@@ o@@ Converter .
patients with lack of anti @-@ anti@@ body levels was dependent on the low anti@@ body levels in the Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti@@ body tit@@ ers a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n was determined .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ gin@@ ale until low neutr@@ alis@@ ing inhib@@ iting effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed not to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction in g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies didn &apos;t seem to stand in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted drug reactions typically with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies tempor@@ ally .
the con@@ cept@@ ing of enz@@ ym@@ es is responsible for the hydro@@ lys@@ is of accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ates and the prevent@@ ing of another accum@@ ulation of enz@@ ym@@ ism .
after in@@ intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly absor@@ bed by the cycle and cells of cells into the lymph@@ omas , most likely to obtain crew 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and effic@@ acy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the entire disease prog@@ ression was the majority of the patients of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient discovered the phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effic@@ acy was the percentage change of FE@@ V and absolute obe@@ di@@ ence in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where it received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients suffer a improvement of lung function and the audit@@ ory function , shown in the following table .
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or main@@ taining this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group as listed below the table below .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly reduced over this period of clin@@ ically significant and absolute magn@@ ific@@ ina increased further propor@@ tional to the body @-@ growing children .
of the 26 patients with a he@@ pat@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly equivalent to 22 ( 85 % ) , up to the end of the study reached a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant to the study .
in terms of h@@ eter@@ ogen@@ eous disease manif@@ estation in patients , the clin@@ ically significant changes of normal FE@@ V , analysis in the 6 @-@ minute test , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deter@@ i@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
one year @-@ old open @-@ 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investig@@ ated in 20 patients at the time of their incl@@ usion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe slow@@ ing @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage due to increased G@@ AG@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Har@@ n was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group the younger patients with severe slow@@ ing form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe contam@@ in@@ ating form only limited to the el@@ derly patients with severe contam@@ in@@ ating form only limited or no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ odynam@@ ic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent the difficulties with weekly infections ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effic@@ acy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ es is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evalu@@ ate any new information which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of features will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic profile of patients aged under 5 was similar to those with older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated with patients who had previously untreated , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously used other chemotherapy reg@@ im@@ ens .
to decrease side effects , patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive in@@ jec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , in addition , or after the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicines for v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid man@@ go ) .
in patients , their blood count may change , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , reduced or the dose must be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA , allowing the cells to share the cells .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ aker in its active form goes lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of drug and longer treatment in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta had investig@@ ated the treatment of 456 patients for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ite me@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , who had had no chemotherapy for their medical condition .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta had been treated in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease , previously compared with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , namely both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study at 1 725 patients who had previously used chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average life @-@ life with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , patients in both studies were not ep@@ ithel@@ ium cells present in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta after administration of A@@ lim@@ ta after administration .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. and author@@ ization of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each extraction bottle has to be solved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the key volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis shall be taken and dil@@ uted with 0,9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma except for superior type ep@@ ithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mongo@@ lia is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with cur@@ d al @-@ advanced bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma except for superior type ep@@ ithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is admin@@ istered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after the end of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
for patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma after previous years , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F admin@@ istered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ gift as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ar@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ aker must be taken fo@@ lic acid at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must continue during the whole therapy period as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third meeting cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be done before every gift , should be a complete blood count , including the differenti@@ ation of leu@@ k@@ cy@@ tes and a plat@@ elets .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ an@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( ALT or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , taking into account the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image , or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity .
after recovery the patients must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy , or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria represent the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ er@@ ia ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 ble@@ eding .
if patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( excluding Neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy must be inter@@ rupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient &apos;s value
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if patients suffer from 2 dos@@ sier reduc@@ ers or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 or as - when occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 ne@@ ur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical studies had no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over , in comparison to patients aged 65 years of age , an increased low @-@ effective ris@@ ky .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended to use children under 18 years due to sufficient data on the in@@ conce@@ iv@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with one cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Cle@@ arance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to use a dose @-@ adjust@@ ments regarding all patients recommended dos@@ sier .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of below 45 ml / min was not enough ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with an liver function restri@@ ction of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper image value ( in the absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not especially investig@@ ated in the studies .
patients need to be monitored in patients and pellets should not be given to patients , before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ id count again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ elets once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose induc@@ tion for other cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ eres , plat@@ elets and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the prec@@ eding cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and void tox@@ icity as Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , fe@@ br@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y was di@@ lig@@ ible if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 has taken place .
therefore all patients suffering from P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients must be applied , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as prop@@ he@@ tic protection ( see Section 4.2 ) .

all patients who are fore@@ seen for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed was necessary to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life @-@ term for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , with which these events occurred , had appropriate provisions for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant water@@ - accum@@ ulation in the trans@@ at@@ ular space , a drainage of the erg@@ ent should be considered before P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardi@@ ovas@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and dis@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occas@@ ionally , if this ingre@@ dient was usually given in combination with another Cy@@ t@@ oto@@ x@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ els ( excluding yellow fe@@ ver ; this vacc@@ ination is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible sk@@ enc@@ ement of re@@ productive activities by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ aker , men should be pointed out before treatment - G@@ inn , advised to include advice on their sperm serv@@ ings .

the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ o@@ plastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally R@@ atio ) , when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ aker in case of pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - rigid an@@ met@@ abol@@ ites are expected heavy for pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ aker may not be applied during pregnancy , except in case of difficulty and by careful loss of use for the mother and risk of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ rever@@ sible sk@@ inc@@ tion consists of re@@ productive activities by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ aker , men should be pointed out before the beginning of treatment , advice on the sper@@ mac@@ ular mode .

the most common ad@@ verse events of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are less stain@@ s at after , Fl@@ atus ( winds ) with chair of mar@@ mal@@ ade , mar@@ v@@ ell@@ eres ( drums ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( wind ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied in patients that are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for prevention of tran@@ splant@@ ation ) or with drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tion syndrome ( if not sufficient nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or in chol@@ ester@@ ase ( liver illness ) , and with pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating moth@@ ers .
in July 2007 the European Commission granted the Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited to facil@@ itate the transportation of goods by Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is used to add weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a light hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ic , low @-@ fat food .
all@@ i should not be used by children and yo@@ ungst@@ ers under 18 , since not sufficient data on pot@@ ency and security .
however , as or@@ list@@ at only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ b@@ ates , is necessary for older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kid@@ ney function .
• High sensitivity to active agent or one of other components • con@@ current treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • chron@@ ological mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tion@@ ality • chol@@ ester@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • simultaneous handling with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ums ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the prob@@ ability of occurr@@ ence gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fet@@ al single meal or o@@ ily diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes is carried out with improved met@@ abolic control , patients that take an anti @-@ medication should consult with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dose of anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic needs to be adjusted .
patients , all@@ i as well as medicines to blood pressure or increased chol@@ ester@@ ol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage should be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional flu@@ ctu@@ ating measures , in order to prevent serious di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea possible contrac@@ tion of oral contrac@@ tors ( see section 4.5 ) .
in both a study on the effects of medicines , as in several cases with the same application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lo@@ wering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally standardis@@ ed ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentr@@ ations of vitamins A , D , E , and K , and beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the norm range .
however , patients should be recommended to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin prepar@@ ates , to ensure adequate vitamins ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the gift of a one @-@ off dose , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed during a limited number of healthy volunteers , at the same time or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma level .
zo@@ ological studies have no direct or in@@ direct harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / o@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and associated with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the pharmaceutical as the absorption of taken fat is prevent@@ ed .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occas@@ ionally ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data is un@@ predic@@ table ) .
the frequency of known side @-@ effects , which were noted after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntary by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is pl@@ au@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to ble@@ eding with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ gy@@ ms of up to 400 mg three times daily were admin@@ istered over a period of 15 days at normal and over@@ weight people , without any significant clinical findings were recorded .
in the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dos@@ ing , there were either no side @-@ effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on exam@@ inations on human and animal , from a fast response of any system@@ ic effects that can at@@ tribut@@ able to li@@ pas@@ ate properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect lies in the l@@ umen of stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine due to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic lip@@ ids .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials with an BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 occup@@ ies the effic@@ acy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hy@@ po@@ kal@@ oral , low @-@ fat food .
the primary parameter , change in body weight compared to the bas@@ eline level ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been reviewed as a change of body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study fac@@ tions lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
though in both studies the weight reduction was observed at 12 months , the greatest loss of weight loss in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall chol@@ ester@@ ol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL chol@@ ester@@ ol amounted to 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % ( initial value of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
in the wa@@ ist range the average change of -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma level of non met@@ abol@@ ism or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ ur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , there was not met@@ abo@@ liz@@ ed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma using only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in very low concentr@@ ations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µ@@ mol ) and without the signs of a cum@@ ulation .

the most common ad@@ verse effects depend on the effects of the capsules together and thereby causes the amount of fat out of the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you might have not consistently reduced the fat content in the diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ize nutrition con@@ tribut@@ ors : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better one week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ induc@@ ed diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite dishes and about the size of the portions you usually take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the chance that you should exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended dosage even@@ ly spread to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal to yourself , not to take them in the form of a fet@@ al mass or one @-@ lasting night@@ fall , as you may occur in other programs for weight reduction , to control them with time due to adjustment of their diet .
• Ap@@ ply medicine for children to dis@@ able . • You may not apply all@@ i according to the box provided that are not applied on the box . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with sil@@ ic@@ ag@@ el , which are used to keep the capsules dry .

over@@ weight has influence on your health and increases the risk for the emer@@ gence of various he@@ avier diseases such as : • Blu@@ blood pressure • diabetes • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( Oste@@ o@@ arthritis ) and your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
for example , a lasting weight loss , for example through the improvement of diet and more movement , may prevent dec@@ iding of serious ill@@ nesses and has a positive influence on your health .
choose meals that include a wide range of nutrients , and learn after and to feed healthy .
energy is also measured in Kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ le , which is also available as indication of the packaging of foo@@ d@@ stu@@ ffs . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake is , how many calories you should take maximum per day .
NOTE the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat supply in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
which amount for you is suitable , remove the below information that is suitable for you , which is suitable for you . • Because of the effects of the capsule , the ad@@ her@@ ence of the recommended fatty intake depends on the recommended dosage .
if you have the same amount of fat as previously , it may mean that your body can &apos;t process this amount of fat .
thanks to ad@@ her@@ ence of recommended fatty acids , you can reduce weight loss and reduce the prob@@ ability of dietary supplements . • You should try to step by step gradually .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to lose heart and continuously increase about 0.5 kg per week in weight , without fru@@ str@@ ations and dis@@ appoint@@ ments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot; &quot; low physical activity &quot; means that you run daily only little or not go , to burn daily 150 kcal per day , i.e. by 3 km Walk , 30 - to 45 @-@ minute walk @-@ work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to put realistic cal@@ ory consumption and fat levels . • If you are mean@@ ing@@ ful is a food di@@ ary with data to cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of further information material that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fatty oils , and to be physi@@ cally active .

Alo@@ xi is used with chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are a strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chemical trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ bo@@ plat@@ in ) .
the acy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( an pharmac@@ euticals , which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ anti@@ body ) .
treatment in patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the gut .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults that received chem@@ otherap@@ ies who are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
the chemotherapy was treated with chemotherapy in 24 hours following chemotherapy , containing 59 % of patients who had been treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 of 223 ) , with 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy , the regular trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are shown 81 % of patients who had been treated with Alo@@ xi ( 153 of 189 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission approved Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a approval for the in@@ land transportation of Alo@@ xi into the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of ac@@ ute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting chemotherapy due to cancer disease and for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ ulated chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can leng@@ then leng@@ then patients with an am@@ ne@@ sty fruit ip@@ ation or a sign of a sub@@ ac@@ ute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , be careful with the same @-@ term gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend Q@@ T @-@ interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended , or those that extend to such renewal .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi in the days of chemotherapy is generally used to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting medicine .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , p@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhib@@ it against tum@@ ors of the five investig@@ ated chem@@ otherap@@ eutic for cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and an Ste@@ ady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D6 inhib@@ itors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D6 @-@ In@@ hib@@ itors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ ol , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , per@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , sy@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , sy@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ anc@@ ies should not be applied , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied , unless it is necessary from the treated doctor .
clinical studies were the most common ad@@ verse of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( 6@@ 33 patients ) which at least could be related to Alo@@ xi in connection with head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and or@@ ip@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of sensitivity and reactions on the subject ( burning , har@@ der , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dose there were similar frequencies of un@@ wanted events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; no dose @-@ response relations were observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy at an Alo@@ x@@ i- over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ ind@@ ol@@ esc@@ ort , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients / m2 Cis@@ plat@@ in , car@@ bo@@ plat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.3 hours ) received , that was given to day 1 without any D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double bl@@ ind@@ study , 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin received 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were given to day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ously .
results of the study with moder@@ ati@@ ated chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy is summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induc@@ ed nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical investig@@ ations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block and extend to vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and re@@ polar@@ ization and extend the duration of action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ f. admin@@ istered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0,75 and 2,25 m@@ g. .
once an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift , after a initiated decrease of the plasma centr@@ ations , a slow elim@@ ination elim@@ ination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma level ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration of concentration ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the total dose of doses of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in normal and cancer patient dos@@ si@@ propor@@ tional .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean age of 11 Ho@@ den@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients ran@@ ged from day 1 to day 5 measured by the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma level at 42 ± 34 % .
for a daily intra@@ ven@@ ous treatment of 0,25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , the C@@ max was comparable according to the one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous treatment ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , but the C@@ max was reduced by 0.75 mg higher after once @-@ time in@@ trac@@ tive intra@@ ven@@ ous administration .
about 40 % are elim@@ inated via the kid@@ neys and around 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron using less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vitro studies on met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D6 and , in a lower size , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination after an intra@@ ven@@ ous one dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found in the ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ am@@ ended active ingre@@ dient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous waste sub@@ jection , the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Cle@@ arance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver working inter@@ ference the termin@@ ale elim@@ in@@ ational consumption and the average system@@ ic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is thus non @-@ justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are regarded as sufficient on the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 . pre @-@ clinical studies resulted in hin@@ ts that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentr@@ ations of ion channels , which can be involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and re@@ polar@@ ization .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ d in about the 30@@ fold of therapeutic ex@@ position in humans ) which resulted in an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully known but because of the high doses used and therefore Alo@@ xi for people are dest@@ ined for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of this results is reduced to humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee approved for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , approved by a negative approval for the use of he@@ pat@@ itis C prescribed drug Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml In@@ jection solution .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A with the same medic@@ inal drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medic@@ inal products ) . &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long att@@ itu@@ tive ) he@@ pat@@ itis C ( one by virus infection caused by virus disease ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic study , the liver tissue damage increases , in addition , values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ es al@@ an@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( ALT ) in the blood are increased considerably .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on submitted data before the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A ( active ingre@@ dient , composition and purity of the drug , active mode , safety and effic@@ acy of he@@ pat@@ itis C ) .
in the study of patients with he@@ pat@@ itis C , the effectiveness of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to 455 patients .
in the study , how many patients were measured after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

moreover , concerns they are tra@@ ded that data will not suff@@ ice to the stability of the active substance and the distribution drug .
the number of patients with he@@ pat@@ itis C that spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after adjustment of the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease was again used in more patients than with the reference dental medicine ; in addition , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from it , the study used in the study was conducted to study how far the drug is an immun@@ an@@ tw@@ ort ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) dis@@ sol@@ ves , not suff@@ ici@@ ently valid@@ ated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with Kru@@ sten@@ ological in@@ coming skin infection ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or bar@@ rage ) , am@@ ending and se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , either rep@@ ell@@ ent or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ surg@@ sten@@ te St@@ aph@@ ylo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go do not affect the type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but for patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body .
if the patient is not speaking after two to three days of treatment , the doctor should investig@@ ate the patient and consider alternative treatments in consider@@ ing .
it works by blocking the bacterial rib@@ os@@ ene ( parts of the bacterial cells , in which proteins are produced ) and inhib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
effic@@ ency of effic@@ acy was carried out in all five studies in the proportion of patients , whose infection was sub@@ cl@@ ung after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to treatment .
in the treatment of infected can@@ opy , Al@@ tar@@ go and Ce@@ fal@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were merged with radi@@ als , approximately 90 % of patients in both groups were treated to treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go has been observed in the treatment of ab@@ scene ( e@@ iter@@ ated cav@@ ities in body tissue ) or infection , which have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is irrit@@ ation at the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) establ@@ ishes the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go bo@@ asts with the risks involved in the short @-@ term treatment of skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ de@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ ar@@ ations , am@@ ending or se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
the European Commission granted the Gl@@ ax@@ o Group to support the European Commission for transport@@ ing the Al@@ tar@@ go Company in the whole of the European Union in May 2007 .
the patients , in which three to three days are no improvement , should even be examined and considered a alternative therapy group ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of re@@ ven@@ tive or heavy local irrit@@ ation , the treatment ab@@ orted by the treatment of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ad shall be carefully explo@@ ited and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections , which is known as Er@@ re@@ ger or susp@@ ected of ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary infections , effic@@ acy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was observed in patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant St@@ aph@@ ylo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered within a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment , or a deter@@ i@@ oration of the infected passage .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ian means of the same skin area has not been investig@@ ated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to small plasma centr@@ ations , which were achieved in the human application by human health or infected heal@@ thcare , a clin@@ ically relevant inhib@@ itor is not expected to be expected in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 As an even oral gift from 2 times daily 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole slightly increased the medi@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ano@@ int@@ ments to the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure of top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ sier adap@@ ts are not applied , if top@@ ian ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hib@@ itors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction based on oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate for a testimony to imp@@ lic@@ ations for the birth and the f@@ ö@@ t@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ian anti bacter@@ ium therapy is indicated clearly and the treatment of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the gift of an system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic .
in dec@@ iding whether the bre@@ ast@@ feeding continues / end or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued to end , is weak@@ ened between the benefit of the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go used , was the most frequently reported side effects of irrit@@ ation at the trag@@ edy that was about 1 % of patients concerned .
active effect of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a sem@@ ic@@ thetic deriv@@ ative of Ple@@ uro@@ mut@@ il@@ in , a substance called by fer@@ mentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ cker@@ ian@@ us ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ cker@@ ian@@ us ) .
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhib@@ ition of the bacterial protein syn@@ thesis of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of bacterial Rib@@ os@@ ome that diff@@ ers from the bacterial population of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ile anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest@@ s that the anti @-@ ind@@ ul@@ atory protein L3 is involved and located in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ B@@ ind@@ sit@@ ing area and the pe@@ p@@ yl@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ entr@@ ust .
by joining the ple@@ dge transfer inhib@@ its Ple@@ uro@@ mut@@ il@@ ine the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , partially P @-@ b@@ bin@@ ation@@ - inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler accommodation units .
due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some infections forms appear , the advice should be considered by experts .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , compared to S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EUS , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ speaking for the treatment in S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EUS , the presence of stands with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ c@@ id@@ in ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was put on int@@ act at un@@ tak@@ ings and de@@ ported skin for up to 7 days .
of 516 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be obtained twice daily for 5 days of top@@ ical treatment of infected trau@@ matic wo@@ unds , were single plasma samples .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients at the time of medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last use .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording of people after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ be increased to 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ; lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhib@@ ition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ism was primarily used by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P2@@ C8 and CY@@ P2@@ D6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) which have been carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro testing on Gen@@ mut@@ ation and / or chrom@@ osom@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peri@@ pher@@ al blood cy@@ l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ core test to the in @-@ vi@@ vo study chrom@@ osom@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female regul@@ ates of limited fert@@ ility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thereby making up to 5 times higher ex@@ position than the highest estimated ex@@ position during the human being ( top@@ ical application at 200 cm2 ) of needed skin :
in an embr@@ y@@ oto@@ x@@ icity study on rats were determined in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human ex@@ position ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed ul@@ si@@ fication ) and material tox@@ icity .

Amb@@ iri@@ x is used to protect he@@ pat@@ itis A and he@@ pat@@ itis B ( diseases that affect the liver in children between the ages of 1 and 15 ) , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Amb@@ iri@@ x is used as part of an existing acc@@ us@@ al plan , whereby protection against he@@ pat@@ itis B may not be reached after filing the second dose .
for this reason , Amb@@ iri@@ x may only be used if during immun@@ ization , a low risk of he@@ pat@@ itis B infection is ensu@@ red , that the vacc@@ ine may be led out of two doses .
if a r@@ acking dose of he@@ pat@@ itis A or B is desired , Amb@@ iri@@ x or another he@@ pat@@ itis B or -@@ B vacc@@ ine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can cause a disease .
once a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recogn@@ izes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens &apos; al@@ ien@@ d &quot; and generates anti@@ bodies against it .
Amb@@ iri@@ x has the same components such as the vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix vacc@@ ine since 1996 and has been approved for the approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix kids since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against the same ill@@ nesses , however , Twin@@ SAFE adults and Twin@@ Cit@@ rix are given children under an existing three doses of the vacc@@ ine .
because Amb@@ iri@@ x and Twin@@ Cit@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports application of Twin@@ Cit@@ rix are also based , as proof for the application of Amb@@ iri@@ x .
the main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antic@@ ancer .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effic@@ acy of the vacc@@ ine was compared with six @-@ month period between the two in@@ jec@@ tions .
at between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children led to the development of anti @-@ anti@@ bodies against he@@ pat@@ itis A and B in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Amb@@ iri@@ x at a six @-@ month distance between the in@@ jec@@ tions was similar .
the most common ad@@ verse events of Amb@@ iri@@ x ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of app@@ et@@ ite , red@@ ness , polar@@ ity ( fatigue ) as well as re@@ produc@@ ibility .
Amb@@ iri@@ x may react to patients who may react in an agent ( allergic ) to other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin with other components ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
as of August 2002 , the European Commission granted the Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. for permission of the transportation of Amb@@ iri@@ x in the entire area .
the ic@@ ec@@ table plan for the prim@@ itive fe@@ at with Amb@@ iri@@ x consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is given at an appointment of choice and the second dose for six to twelve months after the first dose .
a r@@ hy@@ per @-@ vacc@@ ine is w@@ ished for he@@ pat@@ itis A and he@@ pat@@ itis B can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vacc@@ ine .
the anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis B anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis B virus ( anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis ) and anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ Ag ) cells and anti @-@ he@@ pat@@ itis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ body values are in the same magn@@ itude as after the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not entirely secured whether an immun@@ able person who are addressed to a he@@ pat@@ itis A@@ - vacc@@ ine is required , as it may not be protected against anti @-@ white anti@@ bodies as well as the immune memory .
3 As with all injection quantities , for the rare event of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic reaction according to the gift of the vacc@@ ine , appropriate means of medical treatment and monitoring must be immediately available .
if a fast protection against he@@ pat@@ itis B is required , the fun@@ ic@@ ular scheme is recommended with the combination of combinations that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active he@@ pat@@ itis A virus and 10 µg of combined he@@ pat@@ itis B surface applications .
with hem@@ oph@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ orders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ body drug such that in these cases , the gift of another vacc@@ ine may be necessary .
because intra@@ ven@@ ous injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could result in the muscle tissue should be avoided for an optimum imp@@ lic@@ ation , should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation dis@@ orders , Amb@@ iri@@ x can be in@@ jected , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to ble@@ eding .
if Amb@@ iri@@ x was admin@@ istered in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us , az@@ ell@@ ular poli@@ omy@@ el@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influ@@ enza type b vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with a combined ground m@@ umps type b vacc@@ ine was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ o@@ def@@ ensive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ def@@ ect , it may not have adequate imm@@ oral response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ination of these form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fe@@ ver comparable to the frequency which was observed in the earlier Th@@ i@@ omer@@ ate and preserv@@ ative @-@ hal@@ ved vacc@@ ine form@@ ulation .
in clinical trials , 2029 V@@ acc@@ ine Amb@@ iri@@ x were admin@@ istered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Amb@@ iri@@ x was compared with the 3 @-@ cann@@ ed combinations .
only excep@@ tions were the higher frequency of pain and polar@@ ity on a calculation basis pro vacc@@ ine dosage Amb@@ iri@@ x , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the treatment of Amb@@ iri@@ x at 50.@@ 7 % of subjects , compared with 39,@@ 1 % of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cann@@ ed combinations .
after the complete vacc@@ ination comm@@ enced 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects that had admin@@ istered Amb@@ iri@@ x , about 6@@ 3,8 % of subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combined vacc@@ ine .
however , the frequency of exposure was similar ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of subjects , the Amb@@ iri@@ x , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of subjects who received 3 cann@@ ed combinations ) .
the frequency pron@@ ounced sor@@ eness and cer@@ ity was low and comparable to the combination of a combination of combinations with the 3 @-@ cans of vacc@@ ine .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ine , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general investig@@ ations in the Amb@@ iri@@ x@@ ence was comparable with the 3 @-@ cann@@ ed combinations with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated he@@ pat@@ itis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant he@@ pat@@ itis B surface .
however , according to vacc@@ ination with Amb@@ iri@@ x during the 6- up to 11@@ - year @-@ old , there was a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ine with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated he@@ pat@@ itis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant he@@ pat@@ itis B surface , was statist@@ ically different .
in clinical trials that were carried out at the vacc@@ ine at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ Converter rates were obtained one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the first dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ Converter rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 given dosage ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a similar study , which was carried out in 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses Amb@@ iri@@ x and 147 received the standard combination for three doses .
at 289 persons , their imm@@ unity was valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective bet@@ ray ( SP in the table below ) against he@@ pat@@ itis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 dose procedure was significantly higher than with Amb@@ iri@@ x .
Immun@@ e respon@@ ds who were in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds would have reached a month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
both studies were fitted with a 2 @-@ doses of acc@@ iri@@ x or a 3 @-@ doses of vacc@@ ine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ pat@@ itis A virus and 10@@ µg in combination he@@ pat@@ itis B surface applications .
in these persons , who were between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence could be proven by anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies for at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Amb@@ iri@@ x in 0 @-@ 6 months V@@ acc@@ ine .
the immune response in this study observed against both anti@@ gens were comparable with a combination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ active he@@ pat@@ itis A @-@ virus and 10 µg of combined he@@ pat@@ itis B surface treatment in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies was comparable to immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine .
if the first dose of Amb@@ iri@@ x in the second year of life together with cor@@ ro@@ ph@@ us , tet@@ an@@ us , az@@ ell@@ ular poli@@ omy@@ el@@ it@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influ@@ enza type b vacc@@ ine , was admin@@ istered by the first dose of a combined ground @-@ m@@ umps vacc@@ ine , was the immun@@ an@@ tw@@ ort on all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted using 3 doses of the present form@@ ulation in adults , showed the present form@@ ulation with similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ation@@ - and ser@@ um conversion rates like for earlier form@@ ulation .
the vacc@@ ine is to exam@@ ine both before and after re@@ us@@ ation on any foreign particles and / or physical @-@ visible changes .

the he@@ pat@@ itis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al food and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as bathing in water by w@@ ast@@ ers .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms resulting in a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Amb@@ iri@@ x cannot be used completely before an infection with he@@ pat@@ itis C or he@@ pat@@ itis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ine is completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected by using both vacc@@ ine doses Amb@@ iri@@ x with he@@ pat@@ itis B or he@@ pat@@ itis B virus ( even though you / your child will not feel un@@ comfortable or sick , you may not prevent a vacc@@ ine may not prevent a disease .
protect against other infections , which damage the liver or symptoms that are similar to he@@ pat@@ itis B or he@@ pat@@ itis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If with you / your child , an allergic reaction to Amb@@ iri@@ x or any const@@ itu@@ ent of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin is shown ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest themselves through it@@ ching , breathing or sw@@ elling of the court or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ine against he@@ pat@@ itis A or he@@ pat@@ itis B , if you have a heavy infection with fe@@ ver / has .
• If you want to protect a protection against he@@ pat@@ itis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prec@@ eding the second vacc@@ ination period ) .
at a possible risk of infection with he@@ pat@@ itis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will continue with you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Amb@@ iri@@ x .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 in@@ jec@@ tions of a combined he@@ pat@@ itis B / he@@ pat@@ itis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced he@@ pat@@ itis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combination he@@ pat@@ itis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ine dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective components is usually admin@@ istered one month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination before the V@@ acc@@ ine series .
sometimes , Amb@@ iri@@ x is suffering from people who have been in@@ jected to the skin and not in@@ jected into muscle tissue . if you are weak@@ ened with your child due to illness or treatment in your / his body &apos;s own down@@ ward / under@@ go a hem@@ at@@ yp@@ se .
Amb@@ iri@@ x can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vacc@@ ine may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ine is required .
21 Please give your doctor if you / your child will take another medicine ( including the one who have been vacc@@ inated without your child ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without any dis@@ cription , or if you have been given or im@@ immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( anti@@ bodies ) have been given , or that is planned in the near future .

if another vacc@@ ine is needed simultaneously with Amb@@ iri@@ x , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible limbs .
if Amb@@ iri@@ x is given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will still be sufficient .

Amb@@ iri@@ x is available in packages for 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs up to 50 without need@@ les .
based on data , the CH@@ MP has become known as the basis of the first approval for the transport network , the CH@@ MP gran@@ ts that the benefits of benefits for Amb@@ iri@@ x remains positive .
however , as Amb@@ iri@@ x was transferred only in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with an in@@ complete du@@ it def@@ ective or hyper@@ bar@@ ri@@ ph@@ al@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ iac disease ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ite is di@@ lu@@ ded on several single doses to the meals - sw@@ allowed under the food or through a gas cooker ( through the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a nose acc@@ onde ( through the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was no comparable study since ammon@@ aps does not have been compared with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( an anti @-@ medicine , i.e. without active ingre@@ dient ) .
ammon@@ ite may also be loss of app@@ et@@ ite loss , severe acid content in blood , de@@ pression , re@@ pression , lack of loss , abdominal pain , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or , or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) resulted in the conclusion that ammon@@ aps with dis@@ orders of the urea cycle should be relie@@ ved in patients with dis@@ orders of the urea cycle .
ammon@@ ite has been approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the rare condition of the condition at the time of approval , limited information was submitted for this medicine .
the commitment is indicated for all patients in which a complete du@@ z@@ ym@@ ine has already manif@@ ested in the new@@ bor@@ age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with late @-@ manif@@ ested form ( in@@ complete du@@ it def@@ ect , which is manif@@ ested according to the first lif@@ esp@@ an ) , a hyper@@ bar@@ ic enc@@ eph@@ al@@ opathy is used .
for babies , for children who are unable to sw@@ allow pills or for patients with hat@@ red dis@@ orders is also available in gran@@ ular form .
daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein toler@@ ances and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
in patients who suffer an early membrane def@@ iciency of carb@@ amide or or@@ ni@@ peg ro@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substit@@ ution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or Arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ Syn@@ ase def@@ iciency must have arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with hat@@ red dis@@ orders , since there exists a risk for the emer@@ gence of est@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a when the tablets are not right away in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,7 m@@ mol ) sodium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
in patients AM@@ MO@@ PS , patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kid@@ ney in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as with sodium re@@ tention and Ö@@ de@@ mb@@ ild@@ ing in@@ coming clinical conditions can only be applied to caution .
because met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at above the liver and kid@@ neys , should only be applied to patients with liver or kid@@ ney disease .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ur@@ on@@ als and to an increased loss of ne@@ ur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed maturity of cere@@ br@@ al syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of function@@ alities in the brain and therefore a dis@@ ability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is di@@ vor@@ ced during the human milk , and that is why the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS has been con@@ tra @-@ indicated throughout the l@@ act@@ ation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , 56 % of patients suffer at least one undes@@ ir@@ able event ( AE ) and 78 % of these ad@@ verse events was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occas@@ ionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic effect on AM@@ MO@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient , who developed an met@@ abolic En@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ opathy associated with l@@ act@@ a@@ emia , he@@ avier hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , peri@@ ph@@ ery neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
in a case of an over@@ dosage with a 5 month old baby , a minimum dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) was accepted .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed up to 400 mg / kg per day in an intra@@ ven@@ ous ne@@ ur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active link that con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ yl@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is di@@ vor@@ ced via the kid@@ neys .
in@@ tox@@ icity is seen from Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea . both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative support for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ orders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of poly@@ phen@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early enough and the treatment begins immediately to improve the survival of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ gn@@ osis of the early initial form of the disease with occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ f@@ aust , and the disease did not lead to tre@@ ating per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids in the first year of life .
by hem@@ med aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium Ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ duc@@ ed food and possibly sub@@ stit@@ ution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of patients to 80 % within the first month of life .
patients who diagnosed patients during pregnancy was diagnosed with hyper@@ bar@@ e@@ opathy during the first occurr@@ ence of a hyper@@ ammon@@ iac En@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ opathy originated , but even in these patients with time with many of intel@@ lec@@ tual dis@@ ability or other neuro@@ logical def@@ iciency .
in patients with late @-@ evi@@ dent form of the disease ( including female patients with the h@@ eter@@ o@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the Or@@ ni@@ peg ro@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e @-@ Mang@@ els ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ bar@@ ri@@ ca@@ al@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ after diet amounted to 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible to treatment , and in some patients may occur further deter@@ i@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kid@@ neys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ Glut@@ amine .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were obtained after a single dose of 5 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , in an empty healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , obtained from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after an intra@@ ven@@ ous treatment of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral adult dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after intake of meas@@ ur@@ able plasma level of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ us were found .
in the majority of patients with urea @-@ cycles or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies was found after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is det@@ ec@@ table in the plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeat@@ edly treated with phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration in the third day are five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ Glut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no cl@@ astic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral sub@@ mission of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 @-@ 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ PS gran@@ ules is either oral ( babies and children that can still be sw@@ allowed , or patients with hat@@ ching orders ) or via a gas rus@@ hing hose or a n@@ ose@@ onde .
according to the previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um protein should be kept in the normal range .
in patients who suffer an early membrane def@@ iciency of carb@@ amide or or@@ ni@@ peg ro@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substit@@ ution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or Arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ de@@ eds were exposed to the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there came to les@@ ions in the Pyram@@ ids of Hir@@ n@@ rin@@ de .
a likely toxic effect on AM@@ MO@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient , who developed an met@@ abolic En@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ opathy associated with l@@ act@@ a@@ emia , he@@ avier hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , peri@@ ph@@ ery neuro@@ path@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .

the basis of investig@@ ations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ Glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ orders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even if treatment , and for some patients may occur further deter@@ i@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition .

if a patient has to receive the medication on a probe , AM@@ MO@@ PS can be dissolved before use in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver ym@@ es are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the nitrogen of waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins in the body .

Ang@@ i@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance at un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) without &quot; ST@@ - up@@ lift &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value at the electric car@@ dio program or EC@@ G ) .
if Ang@@ i@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that bind to a PCI becomes a higher dose and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the heart in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to main@@ taining blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients ass@@ essed the study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of Ang@@ i@@ ox in the sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ IA inhib@@ itor ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) compared with hydr@@ par@@ in ( an other antic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI was compared .
during the PCI , patients often have a St@@ ent ( a short tubes used in the ar@@ tery , to prevent a lock ) and additionally they received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ auses , such as c@@ ta@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was Ang@@ i@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - with the prevent@@ ing of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who sub@@ jected to a PCI , Ang@@ i@@ ox was equally effective in terms of all indicators , except in severe blood vessels , in which it was much more effective than he@@ aters .
Ang@@ i@@ ox cannot be applied in patients that may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against b@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other brain operators or other components .
moreover , it must not be used in patients who recently had a blo@@ od@@ or@@ rh@@ age , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or serious kid@@ ney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Human Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Ang@@ i@@ ox is a substitute for He@@ par@@ in during treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd issued an approval for the incorpor@@ ation of Ang@@ i@@ ox in the European Union .
to treat adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with an emergency @-@ attack or an early intervention is fore@@ seen .
the recommended initial dose of Ang@@ i@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if an PCI is performed in another result , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the inf@@ usion should be increased to 1,75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI requirements , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be absor@@ bed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be admin@@ istered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
the recommended dose of Ang@@ i@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight , and an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with an dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
safety and effectiveness of a sole bolt of Ang@@ i@@ ox is not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to below 225 seconds , a second layer of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the stim@@ ulated and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully de@@ pl@@ eted and admin@@ istered intra@@ ven@@ ously to the application .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg Inf@@ usion@@ sd@@ osis is properly admin@@ istered .
in patients with moderate kid@@ ney function restri@@ ction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are sub@@ jected to a PCI ( whether disp@@ uted with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS ) , a lower inf@@ usion of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT score is below 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be admin@@ istered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose can be examined again .
in patients with moderate kid@@ ney compensation , which led to approval was included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , the ACT score was 5 minutes after the gift of the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ sier adaptation ( 366 ± 89 seconds ) .
3 In cases with severe kid@@ ney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ tic patients , Ang@@ i@@ ox is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with Ang@@ i@@ ox can be split 30 minutes after the preparation of the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment .
• commonly known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other components or viol@@ ation of brain cancer . • severe un@@ checked hyper@@ tension and sub@@ ac@@ ute bacterial enz@@ ym@@ itis . • severe kid@@ ney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and at di@@ aly@@ tic patients
patients during the treatment are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding especially when B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients suffer from B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most vol@@ t@@ ages in ar@@ ter@@ ial points , patients who under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ization intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of princ@@ i@@ pled rings .
in patients with war@@ far@@ in and are treated with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be drawn in consider@@ ation to ensure that the value returned to treatment with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or plat@@ elets ) , these drugs can increase blood stress .
in combination of B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with plat@@ elets or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological m@@ atics are regularly monitored in any case .
the experimental studies are related to effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / o@@ al development , in@@ adequate , or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 4@@ 604 were random@@ ized to B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hib@@ itor and 4@@ 603 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ aters or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hib@@ itor .
both in the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group and in treated compar@@ is@@ ers in patients and in patients over 65 years were more common to un@@ wanted events than for male or younger patients .
heavy blood vessels were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy blood tests as defined in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both lightweight and heavy ble@@ eding came under B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone as well as in groups of he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hib@@ itor and B@@ ival@@ id@@ rud@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hib@@ itor ( see Table 2 ) .
a AC@@ U@@ ITY equ@@ ation was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , hem@@ at@@ ular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or ble@@ eding in the point of surgery , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 g / dl without obvious blood pressure , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ction of ≥ 3 g / dl with well known blood pressure control , reproduction due to hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , use of blood products for trans@@ f@@ usion .
further , less commonly observed ble@@ eding of blood cells , which were recorded at over 0,1 % ( occas@@ ionally ) , &quot; other &quot; pun@@ ishment places , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal , ear , nose and neck .
the following statistics on ad@@ verse events are based on data from a clinical study with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6,000 patients who sub@@ jected to a PCI .
both in the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group and in treated compar@@ is@@ ers in patients and in patients over 65 years were more common to un@@ wanted events than for male or younger patients .
both lightweight and heavy ble@@ eding came significantly less than in B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA inhib@@ itor .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive application in practice and are listed in Table 6 according to system organ@@ ism .
in case of over@@ dos@@ ing , treatment with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately dis@@ cer@@ v@@ ated and the patient is close to monitor a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age .
Ang@@ i@@ ox contains B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ in inhib@@ itor , both in the cat@@ aly@@ tic centre and in the an@@ ion binary region of TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N bin@@ ds , ir@@ respective of whether TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N is bound in the liquid phase or an indoor cl@@ ause .
the binding of B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N gets slowly c@@ un@@ locked to the binding of B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby increasing the function of the active center of TH@@ RO@@ M@@ BI@@ N .
moreover , by B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with ser@@ um from patients , in which there came to he@@ par@@ induc@@ ed th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ to@@ pen@@ y / he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ ed th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( HIT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no plat@@ elets was in@@ duce .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in showed a dos@@ sier , concentr@@ ating effect that is taken through the extension of ACT , AP@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .

Ap@@ id@@ ra will be used to treat adults , ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents and children from six years with diabetes , which require a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is admin@@ istered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or stored as a continuous inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease that does not cause sufficient ins@@ ulin to regul@@ ate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or does not process ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter response time has a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a long @-@ term ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body does not produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
with type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin can not work effectively , Ap@@ id@@ ra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indic@@ ator for effic@@ acy was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ cer@@ y hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0,14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a decrease of 0,14 % in ins@@ ulin @-@ l@@ is@@ pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0,30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be applied in patients that possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may be twe@@ aked if it is admin@@ istered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
the European Commission granted the Commission of San@@ of@@ i @-@ Aven@@ tis , Germany , approved the European Commission for the transport of ap@@ id@@ ra throughout the European Union in September 2004 .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous caused by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of abdominal muscles .
due to the reduced glucose levels and the reduced ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin delivery can be reduced in patients with one restri@@ ction of the liver function .
any change of activity intensity , the brand ( her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ ov@@ del@@ ays etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturer method can move the ins@@ ulin requirements .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage , or the termination of a treatment , in particular for patients with a ins@@ ul@@ in@@ able diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and di@@ abe@@ tic acid .
conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin for a different manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may be required to change the dosage .
the time of occurr@@ ence of a hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used ins@@ ulin , thus changes to the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that increase the blood sugar levels increase and increase cor@@ di@@ abe@@ tic activity , an@@ i@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enz@@ ym@@ es , psych@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ converting enz@@ ym@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ a , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ es , sal@@ iz@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide anti@@ biot@@ ics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ y , such as Bet@@ ab@@ block@@ ers , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserve the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen should be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies have no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if in@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins exce@@ eds the human milk , but in general ins@@ ulin does not occur in the breast milk , nor does it res@@ or@@ ates after oral application .
in the following clinical studies are listed with clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system@@ organ@@ ism and sub@@ ordin@@ ated , ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occas@@ ionally : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare ( frequency on basis of existing data is un@@ predic@@ table ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is failed to change the injection of injection within the injection unit , in consequence , a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ ph@@ ie may occur at the injection site .
severe hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia with consciousness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , or by an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a Gl@@ uc@@ ag@@ onal ad@@ jec@@ tion the patient should be monitored in a hospital to conv@@ ey the Ur@@ - item for serious hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood glucose levels by stim@@ ulating the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose levels ( especially through sk@@ el@@ eton muscles and fat ) as well as the inhib@@ ition of glucose levels in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that during sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ is@@ be of ins@@ ulin , the mode of action occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus in@@ fer@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeutic aggregate dos@@ ing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more are a dis@@ propor@@ tional increase of the glucose tolerance effect , exactly as Hum@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast drugs as normal human ins@@ ulin and persist@@ ed the complete glu@@ cos@@ mic effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than Hum@@ ins@@ ulin .
data from the data was evi@@ dent that at an application of cat@@ mand@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached , as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if , In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was taken in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given by human te@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ulin is turned into 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as in human te@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - N@@ uts before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
at the beginning of the meal , the cons@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in with gift of the meal was given in the meal 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( picture 1A ) as well as compared to human te@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - previously ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
in gift of the meal , ins@@ ulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in , after the beginning of the meal , after the beginning of the meal , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - previously ) was given before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
