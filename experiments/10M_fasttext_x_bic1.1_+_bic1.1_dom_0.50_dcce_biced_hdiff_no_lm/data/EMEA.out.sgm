<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Consultation Report (EPAR), which is explained as the contributor to the human drug policy (CHMP) to obtain regards to the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or treatment, please read the Packages (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish more information regarding the basis of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets of tablets containing 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melted tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to isolate (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Spres thinking and speech, hallucinations (listening or loss of things that are not present), misconscience and precautions; • bipolar disorder in which the patients lack an episodes (periodes periods) alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for treating heavier to severe manic episodes and for prevention of manic episodes in patients who are addressed in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for fast control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to remove or use the moulds in patients, which allow the swallowing of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are at the same time other medicines, the same as Abilify should be disintegrated, should the dose be adjusted from Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impaired the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter, i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Arievrazole presumably works mainly as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Arievrazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a lower degree as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder helps to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and performing it performing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Efficacy of Abilify, which inhibits symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">In two studies, the effectiveness of injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which were increased from two hours to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol in another study, in another study, efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to occur in 160 patients who have already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder when compared to an increased framediam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of patients received from a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led trials to investigate how the body absorbed the melsine and absorbed the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution showed, Abilify were obtained in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, significantly increased decrease of symptoms and increased unrest as those patients who were given a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying the bipolar disorder in four of the five short-term studies, Abilify was more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented them as placebo over to 74 weeks as interact to interact manic episodes in previously treated patients and when in addition to an existing treatment was administered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify-injections in 10 or 15-mg doses also have also been more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), acathisie (citrate), tremor (citrate), thralgum (citrate), fatigue (citrate), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep changes) and anxiety (sleep changes) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) establishes the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify during the treatment of schizophrenia and in the prevention of a new manic episodes during patients with the predominantly of a new manic episodes and in which the manic episodes had to prevail in the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioral disorder in patients with chronic episodes in Bipolar-I disturbance when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the Company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for intertransport of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy Germanic episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episodes, which had the mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes to the treatment with Ariadrazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, even though single patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of the meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of ABILIFY in treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initials should be considered to be considered if clinical factors reproduce this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is derived from combination therapy, the Ariadrazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suizidental behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases at the beginning or after the change of antipsychotic therapy (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder does not have an increased risk of risk associated with Ariadrazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ariellrazole should be treated with caution in patients with well-known carcardiovascular diseases, herinsufficiency disease, herinsufficiency disease (dehydration disease, hypovolny, treatment with blood-pressure hood medicine) or hypertension (including accelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials that one year or less continued, there were occasional reports about the treatment of Arimaartifol applied Dyspinesie.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dye inetry should be weakened in consideration, to reduce the dose or treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient identifies signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Ariadrazole should be related to patients with varicose incidents in the history of cases or in cases of varicose incidents in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years of patients with Arpiporol are associated with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, had treated patients who were treated with Arimirazole, an increased risk of death in comparison to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixer dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the promise of unwanted cerebrovascular events treated with Ariazrazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemic, in some cases are extremely and associated with Ketoazidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients that were treated with atypical antipsychotic active ingredients including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycaemia, related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drug patients treated directly to the same.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagie and weakness) observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally known in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar leads, the use of antipsychotics, with which weight gain as a side effect, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Ariadrazole on the central nervous system, be careful if Ariellrazole should be taken in combination with alcohol and other centralized drugs components such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist family, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Arimirazole, but this effect however is not relevant to clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers with a high-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) the AUC of Arimarazole was 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dosing reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors can result in higher plasma centrations of Arimarazole compared to CYP2D6 extensively metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common treatment of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should exceed potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-Protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dosing reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose-height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 common with ABILIFY to be given together with a moderate increase in the Arpiprazor concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials showed non-significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methods), 2C9 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patient should be advised to notify your doctor if she are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Arimirazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data of safety in humans and due to the animal clinical concerns, this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, until they are safe that Arievrazole has no negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100), as listed under Placebo or were classified as a possible medically relevant side effects (*).</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of the bottom side effects are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total of lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Acathisie, Dystony and Dyspinesie, were compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled longterm study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients suffer from Ariadrazole treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Ariellrazole, and 15.1% in patients suffer from Oldie therapy.</seg>

<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffer from Ariadrazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term administration phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients suffer from Ariellrazol- treatment and 15.7% to patients treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Ariazrazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of the regular laboratory parameters did not show medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of Cpk (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Arpiporol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">On the side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, Spätdyskinesie and varying receptors, adverse effects in hyperhumility patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, accidental or deliberated overdose with Ariazrazole alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg, and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hemmed alysis in treating an overdose with Ariane razole; however, it is unlikely that hemmed alysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, as Arimarazole has a high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole is transmitted via the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine d2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Ariadrazole showed an high affinity to dopamine d2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergen and to the Histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Ariadrazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the potential-emission tomography showed a dossier dependent reduction in the binary form of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor Liganden, on NuCLEUS cauor-Liganden, at the NuCLEUS cauor-Ligue.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in comparison to 1,228 schizophrenic patients showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one semididol controlled trial, in week 52 the share of Responsible patients who had an instructor worked in both groups similar (Ariadrazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depressionsrata scale, showed a significantly higher improvement than Semoperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks on stabilized patients with chronic scrapophrenia was significantly higher reduction in the declining rate of 34% in the Arpiprazole group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Oldie-controlled, multinational double-blind study found in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved in significantly less patients with a minimum increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of approx.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I-disturbance, Arievrazole was superior to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with fixer dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I-disturbance, Arievrazole was not superior to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy over 12 weeks in patients with chronic or mixed episopropane, Arimarazole showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and an ongoing effect, comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Arievrazole also obtained a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or semi-operidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with chronic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder treatment, with or without mental characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole was superior to malnutrition in comparison to malotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in relation to a stabilization phase, Ariadrazole leopted to placebo over the prevention of a bipolar retreat, primarily in the prevention of a retreat in the Mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 responsible for the Dehydration and hydroxymodelling of Arimarazole which is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination time-life is close to approximately 75 hours for arithmetical metabolism over CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Arimerazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and also showed no gender-dependent effects in pharmacokinetic examination.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Ariadrazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Ariellrazole and Dehydro-Ariadrazole were similar in patients with severe kidney insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with varied liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect in patients with liver cirrhosis, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw shots to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproductionity, genotoxicity and to the practice-clinical data do not detect any special dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, they only have limited or no importance for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects enclose a dosism-dependent side reduction in rats to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the recommended maximum dose of patients) and an increase of incarenal gland under 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 times) in the middle steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of Sulfate conjugate in the bile to repetitive gift from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times) at the recommended intermediate dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose with people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in human beings at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of found concentrations of hydroxycyclic conjugate were no more than 6% of the concentrations, which were found in the study above 39 weeks in the allevials (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed with dosages, which resulted in the dose positions of the 3- and 11fold of the middle steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an Antimicrotubuli-ingredient, which promotes the merging of the microtubuli from the tubes of tubes and stabilizes the microtubuli by inhibiting their dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of microtubular network, which is essential for the vitale interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the transzytosis of plasma components in the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it was proved that the presence of Albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport by the gp-60 Albuminuae (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) is a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and also contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicinal products)."</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron levels in which in connection with a blood transfusion complications may occur in case of surgery a self-blood donation is not possible, and during which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml are expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be conducted under the supervision of an doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a self-bleeding, Abseamed is to injected into a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor if they have received an appropriate guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal sufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobinaries should always be at the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decor in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients suffer from the treatment to ensure that no iron consists of iron, and shank of iron should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>

<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used prior to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell which was put into a gene (DNA) which empowered them to the formation of Epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with submission as an injection into a Vene in a study of 479 patients, associated with kidney problems caused by renal problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks, Eprex / Erypo in a vene, before they were either performed on Abseamed or continued to get Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main indicator for efficacy was the change of hemoglobinations between the beginning of the study and the reporting period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also put the results of a study in which the effects of previously injected Abseamed with one of Eprex / Erypo was examined in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who were suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobinations of patients were maintained in the same extent as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients showed that Eprex / Erypo got an increase of 12.0 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which occasionally lead to symptoms of endzephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, slanting, migrant stock and loss.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abisamed should not be applied in patients that may possibly be oversensitive (allergic) against epoetin alfa or other of other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abisamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, as further studies are required to make sure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) resulted in the conclusion that the medicine showed a comparable quality, safety and efficacy-profile such as Eprex / Erypo in accordance with the provisions of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which is amed, will provide information staff for medical staff in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of infusion of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of Zoledron acid concentration at 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma centration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clever of metabolised substances is unlikely because Zoledron acid is not metabolized because Zoledron acid is not metabolized because they have a weak or not direct and / or irreversible, hydrogen-dependent inhibitor of P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patients (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledron acid correlated with the creatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin-Clearance, and amounted to a total of 64 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose-adjustment of the zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for serious kidney function (creatine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data are required, no failure will be possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest intracal intravenosis was 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">At studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the recommended dose of human exposition), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was determined by doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3-day intervals, in total 6 times (a cumulative dose, equivalent to the 75-minute intervals of the human-therapeutic exposure, equivalent to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure, equivalent to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long term studies with repeated application in cumulative exposition, the maximum of the intended human exposition has been sufficiently exceeded, the toxic effects of other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as intravenous injection methods.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common relation of studies with repeated treatment was a multiplied primary spongiosa in the metaphyse of the long bone in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a power and reflecting the pharmaceutical, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Consultation Report (EPAR), which is explained as the contributor to the human drug policy (CHMP) to obtain regards to the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (especially overweight-dependent patients), in which metformin (a diabetic medication) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetic medication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">Additionally, additionally to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) can be used with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylharnide or insulin, the previous dose of sulfa drugs can be maintained, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfonylharnum or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body-own insulin can be improved better and the blood sugar level sinks, thereby allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos were investigated in Tripleas, in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa drugs, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycery hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c-value which suggests that the blood glucose levels of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplet study the effect of the additional gift of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and sulfa drugs in a decrease of the HbA1c values resulted in a decrease of 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo was given to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin has been investigated in 289 patients, the acts given in addition to insulin, decrease of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0,14% in the patients who also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were visual acuity, infections of the upper airways (colds), weight gain and hypoanaesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be applied in patients, which may react in sensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic Ketoazidosis (high level of acid) - acid mirror (blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos in the context of a monotherapy (if used) is used as an alternative to the standard treatment of metformin in patients, where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted the Company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for creating Actos into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on a page the markings "15" and on the other hand the label "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate, and in which metformin is inappropriate due to contrasts or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients receiving at least one risk factor (e.g. earliest heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin to begin a decompensated heart failure, and increases the dose in accordance with the lowest available rate.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or oil-sufficiency, particularly those with reduced cardiology reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain and dema sufficiency, if Pioglitazzone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study conducted with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about congestive heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial disease values (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of normal) or with other signs of a liver illness, Pioglitazzone must not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">When ALT-Spiegel are up to the 3-fold the limit of the norm range, the liver ymes are soon to be inspected as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If patient have developed symptoms that point on a hepatitis function, such as imprecise nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, fatigue, appetite and / or dark harn, are to verify the liver values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether to continue the treatment of patients with Pioglitazzone, should be managed by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dossier has been detected, which can be caused by obliations and in some cases associated with liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemophthalic acid, the mean reduction in the mean hemoglobines (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients with metastases (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 3-4% and inulin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of an increased insulin-sensitive dose consists of patients, the Pioglitazon as oral-triple or triple-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Under the market launch of Thiazolidindia, including Pioglitazon, including a occurrence or a deterioration of a diabetic MAKULAÖDEMS as a reduction of visual acuity was reported.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there are direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of Makulaödemen, the possibility of a MAKULAÖDEMS should be aware that the patient should report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summing analysis of reports from randomised, controlled, double-blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture ratio was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 factions per 100 patient-years with women who were treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study involving more than 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 905 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients) treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patient should be aware of a pregnancy, if a patient wants a pregnancy or suffering it, the treatment is decreasing (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon had no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">The effects of pharmaceuticals to be metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA-reductasehmer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazon to the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of the AUC of Pioglitazzone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the mentia of hyperinsulinemic and increased insulin-resistance of the parent's pregnancy and thus reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates to the foregal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data is invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the Turgors and the refractive index of lens, as well as other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-attack resulted in the triple of the upper limit of the norm range as often as under Placebo, but less commonly used in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with previously advanced macrovascular disease the frequency of severe cardiac sufficiency was 1.6% higher than under Placebo when Pioglitazzone was between Pioglitazzone.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, selinsufficiency was reported regarding Pioglitazon since the market, however, when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was conducted an summing analysis of randomised unwanted events regarding bone-froth, controlled, double-blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative-mediated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the more than a period of 3.5 years, PROACTIVE study, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%), treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) patients who were treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">For intake of the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears on an activation specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-γ-γ-γ-dg.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon increases glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose analysis in the case of insulin-resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study of Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as a monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% according to the first 6 treatment cycles).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by Pioglitazzone at 69% of patients (50% of patients under gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients with blood sugar were randomly adjusted to insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the mean HbA1c reduced the value of 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to gain only insulin; reduction of insulin-dosed patients treated with Pioglitazon treated.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / Kreatinin-capitals in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg of versus Plazebo) was examined in a small, on 18 weeks conducted research into type 2 diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol, as well as slightly, clinically significantly increased LDLC cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasma glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was observed no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol, whereas during metformin and Gliclazide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazon wasn't just the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial infglyceride level, which affects both a effect on triglyceride absorption and on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular withdrawal study, were randomized 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease in groups were randomised to either existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">Depending on oral application, Pioglitazon is resorated quickly, with the peak concentrations of unchanging Pioglitazzone in the plasma for 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV represents a efficacy of efficiency in about the true efficacy of Pioglitazzone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon could not be found on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with mixture fibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) and lowers the plasma level of Pioglitazzone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After orational use of radioactive Pioglitazon in humans, the marker was found mainly in the orange (55%) and at a lower degree of (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination time of non-banded Pioglitazzone is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centrations of Pioglitazon and its Metabolites are lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance of Mother's Substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies have appeared in mice, rats, dogs and monkey after repeating plasma volume magnification with Hemmodic, anaemia, and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the mentia of hyperinsulinaemia due to treating Pioglitazon and increased insulin-resistance of the parent, and thus reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates to the foregal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long term studies (up to 2 years) high incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (for male rats) were induced by the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family-called polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindia led to an elevated frequency of coloplasms.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on a page the markings "30" and on the other hand the label "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture ratio was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 factions per 100 patient-years with women who were treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study involving more than 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 905 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients) treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of Metformin with each of Pioglitazon or Gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotiations showed in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazon wasn't just the sober triglycerides, but improved also the postprandial infglyceride level, which has a effect on the lacyglyceride absorption as well as on the hepatitis Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing in relation to their primary endometry, a combination from the total mortality, anti-deadly Myocardial infarction, legamputation above the Knöchels, coronary Revascularisation and Revascularisation of leg arteries are close to that with taking Pioglitazzone have no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the label "45" and on the other side the wording "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summing analysis of reports from randomised, controlled trials treated with more than 8,100 patients with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon and obtained by more than 7,400 patients, an increased incidence of bone marvelations with women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study involving more than 3.5 years on the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 905 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients) treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the entry of capabilities of Actraphan throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily, if a fast initialized effect is desired with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">For at least 6 seconds, the injection needle must be injected to skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the single dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients, whose blood sugar is clearly improved by an intensive insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia should be altered and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast-acting, biphasian, long-acting insulin.), insulin or insulin-analogue (by recombinant DNA from insulin-animal origin) may result in fact that a change in the dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If switching to Actraphan in the patient may be a dose-adjustment, it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, where hypoglycic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia was less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before traveling, the patient must be pointed out, the patient should be informed to introduce the advice of his doctor, as such as insulin and meals must be taken or taken for other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore account for possible interactions in therapy and its patients always ask for others by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Sowing hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in a non-sufficiently controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of misses and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemia may lead to consciousness and / or convective failure, and with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function, and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Illnesses of the nervous system Gelegionally - peripheral neuropathy can be identified with complaints that are regarded as acute painful neuropathy and normally reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensification of the insulin therapy with an abrupting improvement of blood sugar, however, may be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycemia may develop in progress: • Easy hypoglycemia can be handled by the oral supply of glucose and sugar supplements.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have bunch of trauma, sweets, cookies or sugar fruit juices. • Heavy hypoglycemia is treated with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of gluucagon (0.5 to 1,0 mg), or by glucose, intravenously through the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The action begins within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours, and the overall active life is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorption profile is justified by the product to act a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed reorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of slit (hydrolytic) places under the human insulinmolecule were moved in considerations; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety, toxicity in repeated treatment, genuxicity, to carcinogenic potential and for reproduction, the preclinical data can be observed no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphan bottle was taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of insulin is done at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is used in accordance with the manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients, where hypoglycic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia was less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor must therefore account for possible interactions in therapy and its patients always ask for others by them.</seg>
<seg id="895">12 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycaemia, which can occur in a non-sufficiently controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of misses and fruit tod in utero.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid a irritation of the esophagus, the patient may take place until after the first meal of the day, at least 30 minutes after intake of the tablet, do not lie down.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already allowed separately in pharmaceuticals to comply with the European Union, data presented from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also led a study with 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase of vitamin D reflection.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with ADROVANCE, lower (11%) than those who were used exclusively with Alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also provided data that that in ADROVANCE contained Alendronat dose exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common adverse events observed (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the lack of movement such as abdominal pain, dyspepes (diarrhoea), diarrhoea (blood stress), dysphagia (valeral disturbances), dysphagia (intoxicity), growl (blinking stomach) as well as sucking exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1283">For patients with persistent hypersensitivity (allergy) against Alendronat, vitamin D3 or other components may not be used for ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be applied in illnesses of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low potassium level) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following critics are exactly to be followed to reduce the risk of malophageal irritation and related side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed after completion of the day with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patient should not cut the tablet into the mouth, as a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera. • The patient should not take place before the first meal of the day, which should take place at least 30 minutes after intake of the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptical Ulkus, active gastrointestinal hemorrhages or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract but only under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Ösophageal reactions, such as Ösophagulitis, violations of malophageal disease, were reported in patients under the intake of Alendronat (partly were they were severe and required a hospital assignment).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore point out attention to all signs and symptoms that are aimed at impacts of symptoms of endophageal irritation as dysphagia, pain at swallowing or retrospecal pain or new or worsening sodburn the medicine (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious adverse effects seems to be increased when the medicine does not take place properly and / or after the occurrence of those symptoms, apply on a malophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing assignments should be passed to the patient and understood by patients (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">In large clinical trials with Alendronat no increased risk was discovered, rare (after market launch) Magi and Duodenalulzera, among them some severe and with complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually reported in connection with a tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis) in cancer patients, is mainly intravenously administered to bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to give the hints whether the abetting of a bisphosphate therapy is diminished in patients that reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the doctor's doctor is crucial for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed out of taking a tablet in the case of taking a dose of ADROVANCE the tablet in the next morning if they have noticed their goods.</seg>

<seg id="1301">Other diseases, which impair the mineral exchange (like vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism), should also treat adjuquate prior to therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronat foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can impair the resorption of Alendronat if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after intake of Alendronat (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific intervention trials were not performed, Alendronat was taken together with a multitude of commonly prescribed medicines, without knowing clinical interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and therefore should be used neither during pregnancy nor lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal welfare with Alendronat have no evidence of direct access effects regarding pregnancy, embryonic / greasy or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoporosis of the oral surgery was reported in patients under bisphosphonates; most reports originate from cancer patients, but also reported in osteoporosepaties.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless the serum of serum calcium can be found up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and the serum-phosphate up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors that are familiar with immunologic therapy and treatment of transplantation patient should take dementions or make changes in immunosrosive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplants or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub or overimmuppings.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and related daily dose; settings of formulation or regimes should be performed only under the control of an experienced medical device (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate can be performed to ensure that systemic exposure of Tacrolimus must be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advocraf was primarily based on the clinical assessment of pick-stools and tolerability in individual cases and blood levels (see below "recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After the conversion of Prograf to Advagraf, Tacrolimus Talks should be controlled by the changeover and over two weeks after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4, the systemic exposure was measured with both formulations, both for kidney and in-transplant patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of Tacrolimus Talking levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf, to ensure adequate substance exposition in the direct infant-transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adaptation of the Advocraf Dosage schemas can take several days until the steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Recommended Dosage recommendation - Converted from Prograf to Advocraf If a transplantation is submitted twice daily dosage of prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf. thus, this conversion is obtained in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a changeover from other immunosuressiva on Advagraf once daily must start treatment with the recommended oral antial dose for prophylaxis of transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Transplantation In adult patients who are converted to Advagraf is a oral initials of 0.15 mg / kg / day to be taken during the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receivers: although there are no clinical experience with Advocraf in a oral initiating patients of 0,10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day, with pancreed patients in an oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in a oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptions in special patient-groups with reduced liver function to maintaining blood pressures in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with limited renal function requiring no effect on the pharmaceutical industry of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose of dose is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic Potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the calcium creadine, a calculation of the creatinincapance and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Transition from Ciclosporin to Advocraf In the conversion of a Ciclosporine based on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is careful (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on Talking levels in the whole blood The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of folding and tolerability in individual case taking whole blood thummetus-levels.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is advised of frequent controls of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of tacrolimus should also be modified after the conversion of prograf to Advagraf, Dosing adaptation, amendments of immunrocosine therapy or even if the tacrolimus-full blood concentration could be controlled (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advocraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases, if the mirror is not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talmud levels of Tacrolimus are usually in the blood flow in the first time after liver transplant, usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml, and embraced patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following excreational therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac transplantation were usually used in the range of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This resulted in serious adverse events, including transplants or other side effects, which can occur as a result of tacrolimus subor or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and related daily dose; settings of formulation or regimes should be performed only under the control of an experienced medical device (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In the treatment of adult patients with transplantation, which proved to be patient in other immune broth treatment, are not yet a clinical data for retarticulated formulation of Advocraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of transplantation in adult cardiac grafts and grafts received no clinical data for retarticulated formulation in Advocraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, who can lead to a downfall of tacrolimuscular diseases in blood and a decline of clinical effect of Tacrolimus (Hypericum perforatum), taking herbal medicinal agents (Hypericum perforatum), taking some other plant remedies during treatment with Advocraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a very careful monitoring of tacrolimus- concentrations on blood, as the tacrolimus blood levels can be subjected among such circumstances on such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, it was considered under Prograf as a Cardiomyopathy called the chamber or septum hypertrophy which can therefore also occur under Advocraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">More factors which increase the risk of such clinical interference are an already existing cardiovascular, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid overload and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuressiva the influence of sunlight or UV light should be reduced by suitable clothing or use of any solar protection by means of a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES like headaches, lack of consciousness, convulsions and longsuffering, should have a radical investigation (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Because Advocraf encuddle, retarded, lactose is included in patients with the rare Galactose intolerance, Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose-Malign special caution.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicinal products that are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can influence metabolism of Tacrolimus and consequently reduce blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended that tacrolimus- blood levels in the same time gift of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism, to monitor and adjust the tacrolimus dose associated with excessive concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction of interaction has been associated with Antimycot such as Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole and associated with the Macrolid-Antibiotic Erythromycin and HIV-Protease (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic study showed that the increase of blood levels is mainly caused by the increased bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to inhibition of gastrointestinal contamination.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as in acute repayment actions, the concentration of Tacrolimus can increase or lower in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus with medicines prescribed by CYP3A4 metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus advocate Clearance of steroid Concetiva and thereby increasing the hormonal position, the measures can be very carefully assumed by the decisions of contraception measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially reduce the clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazon and prolong their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">No indication of a small number of studies on transplantation patient provide no indication that using tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosmotionsiva an increased risk for unwanted events regarding the course and result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant Neoplasmas including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative Diseases and skin cancer associated with tacrolimus reported.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high bond of erythrocytes and plasma radiotone can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysing.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Active mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects on molecular level, the effects of Tacrolimus may be mediated by its bond to a cytosolate protein (FKBP12) that is responsible for the binding of the compound.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcious-dependent inhibition of signage reductions in the T cells and thus preventing the transcription of a particular range of lymphokin genes.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dose and frequency of application apply to whether Advate is used for treating bleeding or prevention of bleeding problems.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood coagulation problems like bleeding in joints, muscles, or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called recombinant DNA-technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell where a gene has been recorded (DNA) which they empowered on the formation of human natural human VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union named Recombinate, but is produced differently, so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate leuophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advantages in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood levels were awarded with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate should not be applied in patients that may possibly be excessive (allergic) against human coagulation factor VIII, Mouse, or Hamsterprotein, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG to support the advent of advances in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitution therapy according to the severity of the factor VIII-Mangels, after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">For the following morrhagic events, the factor of VIII (in% of the norm, or in I.U. / dl) will drop under the relevant plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat, until pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours for patients under 6 years) repeat until the danger is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment course, for controlling the dose and the frequency of injections, a reasonable determination of the factor VIII plasma was credited.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII, different in vivo repair and exhibit different semi-value.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis prophylaxis appointments in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight in the interval of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor of VIII plasma can not be achieved or if the blood counts is not ruled by a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out if necessary for an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The transfer speed should be set to patients, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opted against the procoagulation activity of factor VIII, IgG immune globulins, anthesda units in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 hours of exposure to the largest is and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure systems and anamneural chibitor development, after the changeover from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reoccur of (lower) inhibitors was observed.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the initial approval of the CHMP, the CHMP has continued to be regarded as a positive rating, but considered a positive consideration that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely overseen:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP has decided upon approval from ADVATE, which is required a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another 6 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited, the Committee for Human Use Medicinal Products (CHMP), announced that the company receives his request for the advent of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the soften (tissues that combines other structures in the body, surrounds and support) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a sort of virus that was genetically modified it is a gene on the body of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" which is so altered that there is no copies of itself and cannot dissolve infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumours and should enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein which is made out of which is not defective in the human body by the p53 gene, is usually administered to restoring damaged DNA and to kill the cells, if the DNA can not be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53% does not work properly, and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Data provided data from a study with a patient prior to Li-Fraumeni Cancer in the field of substration, in bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Once the CHMP had examined the answers to the given questions, some questions were still unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the basis of initial submitted documents, CHMP is published on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumours brings advantages to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee distort concerns relating to the medicine in the body, the type of administration and safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently proven that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner, and that it is neither necessary for the environment that is in contact with patients.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company, not knowing the CHMP, whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients is currently studying clinical trials or "compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered drug release means" means that the tablets are combined so that one of the effective components is instantly released and the other slowly is released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay feasibility), through an allergy against pollen (nasal trails) in patients with nasal swival swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and teenagers over 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinataze is twice daily one tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The treatment duration should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose mucous (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects of the severity of the foils were principal symptomatic symptoms resulting from the patient prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and gave a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In case of contemplation of all breeds of the nose, the patient reported that Aerinaze's income, compared with the decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35,9% in the patients with pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucous was considered, the patients showed an increase of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who suffer disloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinatse (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), mouthwash, dizziness (diarrhoea), goniosity, headache, headache, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (insomnia), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who possibly outempire (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components against adrenal drugs or lauatadin (another medicine to treat allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinduce may not be applied in patients, suffering from hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperthyroid (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hyperthyroid), or already having a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a hemorrhagic stroke).</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a approval to the Company SP Europe for transporting Aerino.com throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, if swallow to swallow (i.e. without them to break or to chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should be used due to the lack of data on harmlessness and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) should not be applied for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible, and should not be continued after deducting the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days, since long term use the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decline of pigs in upper respiratory acts, treatment can be continued with desloratadine as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains the drug is also associated with patients who are treated with monoamine oxidase (Mao) inhibitor or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphabetical activity of pseudoephedrine with other vasoephedrin, Pergolid, vintydroergotamine or other dikonvines, phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, Ephedrine, Oxymetazolin, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been examined for this patient data, and data is not enough to submit relevant recommendations to dose.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver working interference. the data is not enough to chat messages to dose.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patient must be informed about treating hypertension or tachycares or of palpitations, heart rhythmic disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or strengthening the headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">At the following care groups: • Patients at digitalis • Patients with heart rhythm disorders • patients with hypertension • patients with hymyocardial infarction in the history of diabetes, diabetes mellitus, bladder, or bronchospasm in the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is taking place at least 48 hours before carrying out dermatological tests, since antihistamine otherwise prevent positive reactions from indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole were administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma level of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">With the results of the psychiatric tests, no significant differences between the loratadine and the placebo could be noted, regardless of whether Desloratadin were taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzymes of Desloratadin responsible Enzym has not yet been identified, so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 was not inhibited nor neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">However, the inconvenience of applying Aerinatse during pregnancy is not backed up, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of deformities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since the studies are not always transferred to humans and in the basis of vasoephedrin characteristics of pseudoephedrin should not be applied to aerinaze in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified that in very rare cases, it may occur in very rare cases that may lead to impairment of traffic noise or the ability to serve presses.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular disease (insomnia, Hallucinations, Tremor, Konvulsions) with possible letteries.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, februises and increased muscle stress, euphoria, arousal, breathing, nausea, vomination, nausea, seizitus, faxia, faxia, seemorders and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">One CNS stimulation is especially likely to use, as well as atropine typical symptoms (oral dryness, pupil, and diligence, skin deficiency, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastercells / basophile as well as the inhibition of expression of the expression P-Selektronic on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At an adult dose with adult, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement ranges of the air performance including the amplification of subjective grief or the tasks associated with the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, increased frequency of grief compared to placebo was determined by the recommended dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestations of a CNS creation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years were attended with seasonal allergic rhinitis, 414 patients received Aerinduce tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine protagonist efficacy of Aerinely tablets, measured by the overall value for the symptom (except nasal swoidal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze pills, with regard to the floating-swelling effect, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinese pills showed no significant differences in particular according to gender, age or ethnic indisseniority.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable in the plasma within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze at healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow rate of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Under a pharmacokinetic multi-Multipoint study, which was carried out with formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects was noted that four subjects disloratadin has been poorly altered.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component Interaction study shows that the exposition (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin following the sole gift of pseudoephedrin was the exposition according to the gift of a Aerinized tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, to toxicity in repetitive gift, for genuxicity and reproductiontion, the pre-clinical data can be recognized by Desloratadin, however, no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">This combination had no bigger toxicity as its components, and the observed effects were generally used in connection with the synthetics of pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductionstoxic studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was a dose of up to 150 mg / kg per day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 The pharmaceutical application is established and works well before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamine carry on the relieving of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, one body-own substance, its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children ages 6 to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">In total eight studies of patients with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal rhinitis and two studies on patients who had asthma) were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the hives, impairment of sleep and performance in days) and after six months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further trials were presented to prove that the body needs the syrup to remove the solution and the meltablet in the same way as the tablets and use of children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">If allergic rhinitis succeeded when the results of all studies have been studied with 5 mg Aerius, an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom points) by 25 to 32%, compared to decrease from 12 to 26% in patients who were given a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies with urticaria the decrease of the symptom counts with Aerius 58 and 67% compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo was treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied in patients who may possibly be oversensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, Loratadine or other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">From January 2001, the European Commission granted a approval to the Company SP Europe for transporting aeronauts in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to prevent the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are restricted experience of clinical trials to utilise Desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergy rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the hitherto of the disease and, according to the unreadable of the symptoms, it should be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergy rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) may be recommended for patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found during clinical trials with desloratadin tablets, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazole may also be given (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study at the same time taking of Aerus and alcohol, the most powerful effect of alcohol has not increased (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified that in very rare cases, it may cause impairment of traffic noise or the ability to serve presses.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerus, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly manifested side effects, more common than in placebo was tiredness (1,2%), oral-dryers (0.8%), and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 youthful patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was treated with 5.9% of patients who have been treated with desloratadin and with 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, where up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (ninth clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastercells / basophile as well as the inhibition of expression of expression P-selector for endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multi-gyms, in which disloratadine was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinical-relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which Desloratadin has been given a dose of 45 mg daily (a ninth of the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the QTC interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dossier study, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement ranges of the air performance including the amplification of subjective grief or the tasks associated with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of eyes as well as itching of the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into an allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">The allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As is shown using the total amount of questionnaire on the quality of life in Rhino-stimulitis, Aerius reduces severely affected by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated specifically for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology imbalmed the aetiology in different forms, and chronic patients can be simplaided.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine therapy is a causal factor in all urticulous diseases, desloratadin is expected to improve such symptoms of the chronic idiopathic urticaria in other forms of the urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidances.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of predators and the number of hives by the end of the first dose of dossier.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamine, from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in sugary gain by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and waxy, as measured through a 4-point scale to evaluating the variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In an pharmacokinetic study, in which patients with general seasonal hinitis -population was comparable, with 4% of patients a higher concentration of Desloratadin was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no connection points for a clinically relevant cumulation after a daily use of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the metabolism of Desloratadin responsible Enzym has not yet been identified, so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 was not inhibited nor neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier study with disloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fetched, calorie-oriented breakfast) did not work on the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials listed with Desloratadin and Lorin adin, with a comparative degree of exposition of desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in regards to desloratadin and by Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety, toxicity in repetitive gift, genuxicity and reproductiontion can be observed with desloratadin no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, Hymellose, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independent of meals, on relieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The resulting doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis must be caused by infection (see Section 4.4) and that no data is required to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Apart from exclusion of upper respiratory infections, or anatomical anomalies should play a role in the diagnosis of the Anamhistory, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin studies.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolism, Desloratadin restricted and experienced a higher substance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, the restricted metabolism, is identical to the children that normally metabolish.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains saccharose and sorbitol, therefore patients should not take with hereditary problems of fructose intolerant, glucose or succession-isomaltase- insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found during clinical trials with Aerus tablets, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazole may also be given (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study at the same time taking of Aerus tablets and alcohol, the most powerful effect of alcohol has not increased (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total number of side-side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar with the Aerius syrup group like the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerus, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study on adults and adolescents, with up to 45 mg of desloratadine (ninth clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 years received a daily desloratadindose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin can be extrapolated in adults to the population population extrapolated.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study with multi-gyms in adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily was used daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically substantial cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study on adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the ninth of the clinical dose) was applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the QTC interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents have no increased frequency of grief compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">For a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerus tablets were conducted at adults and youngsters in clinical trials to no impairment of Psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies on adults it came from the simultaneous use of alcohol either to gain alcohol-induced loss of power even in increasing the drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and youthful patients with allergic rhinitis, aeronautics were effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of eyes as well as itching of the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As is shown using the total amount of questionnaire on the quality of life in Rhino-stimulitis, Aerus tablets effectively reduce the severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of predators and the number of hives by the end of the first dose of dossier.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metaboizing phenotype was comparable with adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, the restricted metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was approximately 6mal higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no connection points for a clinically relevant active ingredient after a daily use of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) for 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, AUC- and Cmax values of desloratadin, with papal patients were comparable with those of adults who received diloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, that is not yet identified for the metabolism of desloratadin responsible entities, so that interaction with other medicines cannot be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1911">In combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with Protease.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The anti-oxidant Ritonavir intensified drugs Agenerase was compared to 206 adults who had previously used Protease Inhibians with other Protease.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-repellent centrations of HIV in the blood (viral load), or change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not had any Protease in patients, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children the viral load was also reduced to the viral load, however, from the children who had been treated earlier with Protease was very few in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Protease ehemiah, use Ritonavir to intensified the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other Protease of treatment:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, the against four other Protecting Wall was stable, along with Ritonavir, it came to a stronger decrease of the viral load after four weeks as compared with the patients who continued their hitherto further premiums:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (blasting), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>

<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase Capsules should be administered to pharmacokinean boost from Amprenavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should be made considering the individual viral resistance patterns and pretreatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to take up 14% less than one capsule; therefore, asgeneral capsules and solution are not interchangeable on one milligrams per milligrams basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for aggenase capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Ageneric Chase are used without the reinforcement of Ritonavir (Boopholstered), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for aggenase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of renewable energy in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other Protease in children were not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Generase is not recommended for use with children under 4 years, due to the lack of data relating to the error and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily with a heavy liver function in adult patients and in patients with severe liver function on 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be done in patients with mild or more severe liver working interference in patients with severe liver working interference (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Aspecase may not be given to pharmaceuticals in addition to a small therapeutic width and in addition to substrate the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), due to risk reduction in plasma centrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that asgeneral or any other antiretroviral therapy not lead to an healing of HIV infection, and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infection or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with augenerase does not prevent HIV to other contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Ageneric Capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are treated to chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral combination therapy, increased risk for severe liver effects with potentially fatal course.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of local Midazolam with other Protease inhibitors can point out on a possible rise in the plasma level of Midazolam around the 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is given together with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored to oppressed symptomatic symptoms, especially if it also has low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historic comparisons, no recommendation can be given as if Amprenavir is not given at the same time as Amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">At the same time gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, a reinforced control of INR (International Normally Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weaker or gain of antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore, alternative methods are recommended to contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended by the same-term gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 trial and extension of APV30005 (700 mg fossil imavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: N = 107) the patients treated with virologically decay about 96 weeks, the following Prototype-Mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance tests, analyses of genotypic interpreters can be used for estimating the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with Protease Inresistant insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-Algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I / I, L33F, I84V and L90M, with an increasing phenomenal resistance to Fosamperavir, with Ritonavir and a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions on the relevance of certain mutations or mutation pattern may be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to make the results of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance tests, clinically validated phenotypic interpretative systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data for the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with Protease Inresistant insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2029">To distribute the diagnostic resistance tests, clinically proven hydraulic-phenotypic cut-offs (dividers) for FPV / RTV that can be used for interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Amprenavir associated data resided against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally received.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Currently data is currently used for cross resistance between Amprenavir and other Protease for all 4 Foscarrenavir Resistenzpfade, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients, with a resistance to Lopinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 insulating materials), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 insulator), Saquinavir (three of 24 insulating materials), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 insulating materials).</seg>
<seg id="2033">In contrast, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protective hibitors of insulating products; the receipt of this activity seems to be depending on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of an failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders which can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of efficacy of aspecology in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized study (600 mg twice daily) along with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanalogue (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with lower Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to the generase, at least one PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis did not determine the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average change (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma for 16 weeks, with a non-sub-disease threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of unborn Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with 288 HIV infall children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Ageneric solution has been studied for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily. the surplus of the patients were 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose of Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI was at least one (78%) or two (42%) along with augenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered in consideration with PI for children to benefit from the expected benefit of "unused" renewable energies.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the medium duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir are about 1 to 2 hours for each capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cmax, reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered along with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after application (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was implicated by the food intake, although the intimely dietary intake influences the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent volume of distribution is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be produced to a large distribution volume as well as an impaired retiration of Amprenavir from the blood circulation in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change directs to a decrease of the total concentration in the plasma, whereby the amount of injured amprenavir, which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of infertile Amprenavir is constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval gravated in the region of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore medicines to be induced by CYP3A4 or inhibit or substrate a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution, if they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of asgenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amprenavir exposure as in adults with an dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amminavir is made from the solution 14% less organic than from the capsules; therefore, asgeneral solution and regenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on one milligrams base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of an kidney function should be reduced to the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This therapy schemes lead to Amprenavir plasma centred for those who have taken in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long term studies, with Amprenavir to mice and rats occurred in male animals, the patronellular adenomas of dosages based on the 2.0-mouth (mice) of the exposition on the human being, after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the creation of the hepatronellular Adenome and carcinomas were not yet resolved and the relevance of that observed effects in human beings is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present Exposition data on humans, both from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic use, however, few hints for the assumption of a clinical ratio of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro gene tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mice symptoms of rats and chromosome-erration test to human peripheral lymphocytes, was Amprenavir neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical daily routine using AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical studies, no significant toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of augenerase caused by the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity studies, which were treated at the age of 4 days, showed a high mortality, both in control and with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">At a systemic plasma exposition, significantly higher (rats) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage at humans were observed, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeleton changes were observed on a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Ageneric Chase are used without the reinforcement of Ritonavir (pholstered), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for aggenase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous use should be done in patients with a weak or mild liver working with caution, for patients with severe liver working interference (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause severe or life-threatening effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of International Normally Ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Generase should be set at duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or allergic symptoms (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk for a Lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin causes 82% decrease in AUC by Amprenavir who can lead to a virological failure and resistance to resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2072">A dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but it is not recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with the favor in combination with amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended because the exposition of both Protease of retirement would result.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these medicines can be applied together, caution is careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed as providing accurate forecast of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir to Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="2075">When it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin along with augenerase is to be administered to a reduction of the dose of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data is required for this.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentration of calcium-channel blockers like Amlodipin, dilempin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin and verapamil can increase by amprenavir, thus avoiding the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study conducted in Ritonavir 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily), the Fluticasonpropionat plasma level was significantly increased, while the endogeneous Kortisol rose by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">At the same time gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, a reinforced control of INR (International Normally Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weaker or gain of antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg of ethinylestradiol) led to a decrease of the AUC and Cmin by Amprenavir by 22%.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, primarily the safety of the medicine was investigated, however, it was also examined by its effectiveness (in terms of reduced Gag concentrations in urine and in terms of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age, Aldurazyme experienced the Gag-concentrations in urine by approximately 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, abdominal pain, rinsalgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under five years have increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardie (accelerated heart rate), fever and shootings.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may react in patients who may react very sensitive (allergic) to avonidase or other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be updated every year all new information which may be known, vertically and modifying this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturers of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observed Aldurazyme in relation to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>

<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase Deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a doctor, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h may be increased when the patient carries this, every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of algae in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients, no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver disease is not determined, and for these patients, no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any related side effects, during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be physically monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be provided in a reasonable clinical environment in the recreational equipment for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Because of the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients of IgG antibody produce antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience on the recovery of treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretical increased risk of relation to a interrelation of treatment carefully.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamine and / or antipyretic) to minimise the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of light or heavy infusion-related reaction, treatment with anti-histamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen was aimed and / or reduction of the infusion rate on half of the infusion rate.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, serious infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are downwards, a treatment with anti-histamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>

<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or Procain, as a potentially risk of interference using intracellular absorption of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / oal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is exposed to newborns that are exposed to Laronidase about breast milk, is recommended to satisfy during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">In clinical studies, the effects of clinical studies have been reported primarily as infusion-related reactions which was observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme that observed during the phase-3 study and after having been observed in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 up to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional involvement in the upper airways and in the prehistory, heavy reactions take out, including bronchospasm, breathing algesic and facial zones (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted pharmaceutical actions in connection with Aldurazyme who were reported during a phase- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe slowing up and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a current exit from the study) were reported on 13 / 45 patients with an investigational antibodies (RIP) Assay replaceable antibodies, among them 3 patients, with whom there were never too SeroConverter.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of anti-antibody levels was dependent on the low antibody levels in the Harn, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of Gag in Harn was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed marginale until low neutralising inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed not to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction in gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies didn't seem to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions typically with the formation of IgG antibodies temporally.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The concepting of enzymes is responsible for the hydrolysis of accumulated substrates and the preventing of another accumulation of enzymism.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After inintravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly absorbed by the cycle and cells of cells into the lymphomas, most likely to obtain crew 6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the entire disease progression was the majority of the patients of the middle phenotype and only one patient discovered the phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy was the percentage change of FEV and absolute obedience in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study, where it received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme patients suffer a improvement of lung function and the auditory function, shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in deraldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme Group as listed below the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is not significantly reduced over this period of clinically significant and absolute magnificina increased further proportional to the body-growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatatomegaly equivalent to 22 (85%), up to the end of the study reached a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the Gag mirror in Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant to the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of heterogeneous disease manifestation in patients, the clinically significant changes of normal FEV, analysis in the 6-minute test, was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">One year-old open-2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmacokinetic of Aldurazyme was investigated in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe slowing-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage due to increased GAG- Mirror in the Harn was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group the younger patients with severe slowing form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with severe contaminating form only limited to the elderly patients with severe contaminating form only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemata were carried out on the Gag mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent the difficulties with weekly infections; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2526">Zoological studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / oal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The effects of orlistat are mainly Gastrointestinal nature and associated with the pharmacological effects of the pharmaceutical as the absorption of taken fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1.000) and very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (frequency on the basis of the available data is unpredictable).</seg>

<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multi-gyms of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight people, without any significant clinical findings were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of the cases reported by Orlistat-overdosing, there were either no side-effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used with chemotherapies that are a strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as chemical trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The acy of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (an pharmaceuticals, which can be used as an antiemantibody).</seg>
<seg id="2610">Treatment in patients under 18 years is not recommended, since the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults that received chemotherapies who are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">The chemotherapy was treated with chemotherapy in 24 hours following chemotherapy, containing 59% of patients who had been treated with Aloxi (132 of 223), with 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the regular trigger for nausea and vomiting are shown 81% of patients who had been treated with Aloxi (153 of 189), compared with 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolassetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission approved Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the inland transportation of Aloxi into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevention of acute nausea and vomiting chemotherapy due to cancer disease and for prevention of nausea and vomiting chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by a strongly emulated chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can lengthen lengthen patients with an amnesty fruit ipation or a sign of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, be careful with the same-term gift from Palonosetron with drugs that extend QT-interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended, or those that extend to such renewal.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi in the days of chemotherapy is generally used to prevent nausea and vomiting medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, ponosetron did not inhibit against tumors of the five investigated chemotherapeutic for cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and an Steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokinetic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Dexamethasol, Cimetidin, peroxetine, syoxetine, syoxetine, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies should not be applied, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied, unless it is necessary from the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical studies were the most common adverse of 250 micrograms to observe side effects (633 patients) which at least could be related to Aloxi in connection with headaches (9%) and oripation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of sensitivity and reactions on the subject (burning, harder, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dose there were similar frequencies of unwanted events such as in the other dosing groups; no dose-response relations were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy at an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-indolescort, a total of 1,132 patients / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg of Dolassetron (half-life 7.3 hours) received, that was given to day 1 without any Dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double blindstudy, 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin received 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the study with moderatiated chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenous chemotherapy is summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block and extend to ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of i.f. administered palonosetron in single doses of 0,25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg..</seg>
<seg id="2636">Once an intravenous gift, after a initiated decrease of the plasma centrations, a slow elimination elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma level (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration of concentration (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the total dose of doses of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg in normal and cancer patient dossiproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift from Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean age of 11 Hodencarcinoma patients ranged from day 1 to day 5 measured by the Palonosetron plasma level at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">For a daily intravenous treatment of 0,25 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days, the Cmax was comparable according to the one-time intravenous treatment (AUC0- ∞), but the Cmax was reduced by 0.75 mg higher after once-time intractive intravenous administration.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated via the kidneys and around 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, compared to Palonosetron using less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lower size, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous one dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose were found in the urine, Palonosetron as unamended active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous waste subjection, the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver working interference the terminale eliminational consumption and the average systemic exposure of Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is thus non-justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are regarded as sufficient on the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10. pre-clinical studies resulted in hints that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels, which can be involved in ventricular de- and repolarization.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose correspond in about the 30fold of therapeutic exposition in humans) which resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumours, pituitary, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known but because of the high doses used and therefore Aloxi for people are destined for a unique application, the relevance of this results is reduced to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but for patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not speaking after two to three days of treatment, the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments in considering.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosene (parts of the bacterial cells, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Efficency of efficacy was carried out in all five studies in the proportion of patients, whose infection was subclung after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected canopy, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were merged with radials, approximately 90% of patients in both groups were treated to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo has been observed in the treatment of abscene (eiterated cavities in body tissue) or infection, which have been proven or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is irritation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) establishes the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo boasts with the risks involved in the short-term treatment of skin infections: • Impedeo, • infected small Lazarations, amending or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">The European Commission granted the Glaxo Group to support the European Commission for transporting the Altargo Company in the whole of the European Union in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, in which three to three days are no improvement, should even be examined and considered a alternative therapy group (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of reventive or heavy local irritation, the treatment aborted by the treatment of Retapamulin Salad shall be carefully exploited and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections, which is known as Erreger or suspected of (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary infections, efficacy of retapamulin was observed in patients with infections, which were caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered within a 2-3-day treatment, or a deterioration of the infected passage.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topian means of the same skin area has not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to small plasma centrations, which were achieved in the human application by human health or infected healthcare, a clinically relevant inhibitor is not expected to be expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 As an even oral gift from 2 times daily 200 mg of Ketoconazole slightly increased the mediapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% retapamulin anointments to the skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure of topical application in patients, dossier adapts are not applied, if topian retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction based on oral ingestion and are inadequate for a testimony to implications for the birth and the fötale / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be applied during pregnancy if a topian anti bacterium therapy is indicated clearly and the treatment of retapamulin is preferable to the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / end or the therapy with Altargo continued to end, is weakened between the benefit of the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo used, was the most frequently reported side effects of irritation at the tragedy that was about 1% of patients concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active effect of retapamulin is a semicthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance called by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis of the 50S subunit of bacterial Ribosome that differs from the bacterial population of other ribosomal interagile antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggests that the anti-indulatory protein L3 is involved and located in the ribosomal P-Bindsiting area and the pepyltransferasezentrust.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By joining the pledge transfer inhibits Pleuromutiline the peptidyltransfer, partially P-bbination- interactions and prevent the normal education active 50S ribosomaler accommodation units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance to the application of retapamulin, at least some infections forms appear, the advice should be considered by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of retapamulin, compared to S.AUREUS, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-speaking for the treatment in S.AUREUS, the presence of stands with additional virus factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamulin salbe was put on intact at untakings and deported skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% retapamulin salbe obtained twice daily for 5 days of topical treatment of infected traumatic wounds, were single plasma samples.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients at the time of medication and children between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording of people after topical application of 1% obe increased to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml; lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism was primarily used by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) which have been carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro testing on Genmutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood cylymphocytes as well as in rats-microcore test to the in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female regulates of limited fertility at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thereby making up to 5 times higher exposition than the highest estimated exposition during the human being (topical application at 200 cm2) of needed skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were determined in oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposition (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed ulsification) and material toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver in children between the ages of 1 and 15), which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of an existing accusal plan, whereby protection against hepatitis B may not be reached after filing the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if during immunization, a low risk of hepatitis B infection is ensured, that the vaccine may be led out of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a racking dose of hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or -B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can cause a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens' aliend "and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix has the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix vaccine since 1996 and has been approved for the approved vaccine Twinrix kids since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect against the same illnesses, however, TwinSAFE adults and TwinCitrix are given children under an existing three doses of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and TwinCitrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports application of TwinCitrix are also based, as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective anticancer.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six-month period between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">At between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children led to the development of anti-antibodies against hepatitis A and B in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix at a six-month distance between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, redness, polarity (fatigue) as well as reproducibility.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may react to patients who may react in an agent (allergic) to other ingredients or neomycin with other components (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">As of August 2002, the European Commission granted the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. for permission of the transportation of Ambirix in the entire area.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The icectable plan for the primitive feat with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is given at an appointment of choice and the second dose for six to twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">A rhyper-vaccine is wished for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-hepatitis) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) cells and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same magnitude as after the vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not entirely secured whether an immunable person who are addressed to a hepatitis A- vaccine is required, as it may not be protected against anti-white antibodies as well as the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection quantities, for the rare event of an anaphylactic reaction according to the gift of the vaccine, appropriate means of medical treatment and monitoring must be immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the funicular scheme is recommended with the combination of combinations that contains 360 ELISA units formalininactive hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface applications.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hemophalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibody drug such that in these cases, the gift of another vaccine may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intravenous injection or intramuscular administration could result in the muscle tissue should be avoided for an optimum implication, should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombozytopenie or blood coagulation disorders, Ambirix can be injected, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, azellular poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib), or with a combined ground mumps type b vaccine was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunodefensive therapy or in patients with immunodefect, it may not have adequate immoral response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination of these formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable to the frequency which was observed in the earlier Thiomerate and preservative-halved vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 Vaccine Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-canned combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and polarity on a calculation basis pro vaccine dosage Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the treatment of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects, compared with 39,1% of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-canned combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination commenced 66.4% of subjects that had administered Ambirix, about 63,8% of subjects who were vaccinated with the 3-dose combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of exposure was similar (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects, the Ambirix, compared with 36.2% of subjects who received 3 canned combinations).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency pronounced soreness and cerity was low and comparable to the combination of a combination of combinations with the 3-cans of vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccine, the occurrence of local reactions and general investigations in the Ambirixence was comparable with the 3-canned combinations with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, according to vaccination with Ambirix during the 6- up to 11- year-old, there was a common occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines, which reported about severe side effects during the 2-doses of vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface, was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out at the vaccine at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the SeroConverter rates were obtained one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the first dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The SeroConverter rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 given dosage (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a similar study, which was carried out in 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination for three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">At 289 persons, their immunity was valuable, the Seroprotective betray (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 dose procedure was significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Immune responds who were in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds would have reached a month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies were fitted with a 2-doses of accirix or a 3-doses of vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg in combination hepatitis B surface applications.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In these persons, who were between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence could be proven by anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in 0-6 months Vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response in this study observed against both antigens were comparable with a combination of 3 doses, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactive hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg of combined hepatitis B surface treatment in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-old was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies was comparable to immunization in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life together with corrophus, tetanus, azellular poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, was administered by the first dose of a combined ground-mumps vaccine, was the immunantwort on all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted using 3 doses of the present formulation in adults, showed the present formulation with similar seroprotation- and serum conversion rates like for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to examine both before and after reusation on any foreign particles and / or physical-visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms resulting in a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot be used completely before an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccine is completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected by using both vaccine doses Ambirix with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus (even though you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or sick, you may not prevent a vaccine may not prevent a disease.</seg>

<seg id="2784">• If you want to protect a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and preceding the second vaccination period).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will continue with you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a combination hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination before the Vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is suffering from people who have been injected to the skin and not injected into muscle tissue. if you are weakened with your child due to illness or treatment in your / his body's own downward / undergo a hematypse.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons on the vaccine may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is required.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Please give your doctor if you / your child will take another medicine (including the one who have been vaccinated without your child) or if you have been vaccinated without any discription, or if you have been given or imimmunoglobulins (antibodies) have been given, or that is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It can be, however, in this case, the immune response to the vaccine is not enough and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is needed simultaneously with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible as possible limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually Ambirix pregnant or lactating women is not enough, except for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B vaccinated.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packages for 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs up to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on data, the CHMP has become known as the basis of the first approval for the transport network, the CHMP grants that the benefits of benefits for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix was transferred only in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with an incomplete duit defective or hyperbarriphalopathy (brain damage due to high ammoniac disease) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonite is diluded on several single doses to the meals - swallowed under the food or through a gas cooker (through the stomach-leading hose) or a nose acconde (through the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was no comparable study since ammonaps does not have been compared with any other treatment or placebo (an anti-medicine, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonite may also be loss of appetite loss, severe acid content in blood, depression, repression, lack of loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) resulted in the conclusion that ammonaps with disorders of the urea cycle should be relieved in patients with disorders of the urea cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonite has been approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the rare condition of the condition at the time of approval, limited information was submitted for this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The commitment is indicated for all patients in which a complete duzymine has already manifested in the newborage (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with late-manifested form (incomplete duit defect, which is manifested according to the first lifespan), a hyperbaric encephalopathy is used.</seg>

<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer an early membrane deficiency of carbamide or ornipeg roscarbamylase, the substitution of citruline or Arginine is required in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a ArgininosuccinatSynase deficiency must have arginine in a dose of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with hatred disorders, since there exists a risk for the emergence of estophagusulzera when the tablets are not right away in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMOPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, correspondingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">In patients AMMOPS, patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and Ödembilding incoming clinical conditions can only be applied to caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolization and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat above the liver and kidneys, should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney disease.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous treatment of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronals and to an increased loss of neurons.</seg>

<seg id="2831">In a case of an overdosage with a 5 month old baby, a minimum dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) was accepted.</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed up to 400 mg / kg per day in an intravenous neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active link that conjugated by acetylylamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is divorced via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Intoxicity is seen from Phenylacetylglutamine with urea. both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative support for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of polyphenbutybutyrate between 0.12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early enough and the treatment begins immediately to improve the survival of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early initial form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always inffaust, and the disease did not lead to treating peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemmed alysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium Benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), proteinduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of patients to 80% within the first month of life.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients who diagnosed patients during pregnancy was diagnosed with hyperbareopathy during the first occurrence of a hyperammoniac Encephalopathy originated, but even in these patients with time with many of intellectual disability or other neurological deficiency.</seg>

<seg id="2841">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible to treatment, and in some patients may occur further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylGlutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after a single dose of 5 g Sodium phenylbutyrat, in an empty healthy adult and with liver cirrhosis, obtained from oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after an intravenous treatment of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral adult dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, 15 minutes after intake of measurable plasma level of phenylbutyrus were found.</seg>

<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentration in the third day are five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of conjugated product PhenylacetylGlutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no clastic effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral submission of an individual dose of 878-2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMOPS granules is either oral (babies and children that can still be swallowed, or patients with hatching orders) or via a gas rushing hose or a noseonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein should be kept in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer an early membrane deficiency of carbamide or ornipeg roscarbamylase, the substitution of citruline or Arginine is required in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMOPS granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for instance at unstable angina (a heart attack) or myocardial infarction (diarrhea) without "ST- uplift" (an anomal measuring value at the electric cardio program or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients that bind to a PCI becomes a higher dose and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to the heart in patients with angina or heart attack to maintaining blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients assessed the study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox in the sole gift or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) compared with hydrparin (an other anticoagulant) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often have a Stent (a short tubes used in the artery, to prevent a lock) and additionally they received other medicines to prevent blood clauses, such as ctaximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - with the preventing of new events (deaths, heart attacks or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year, as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who subjected to a PCI, Angiox was equally effective in terms of all indicators, except in severe blood vessels, in which it was much more effective than heaters.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox cannot be applied in patients that may possibly be oversensitive (allergic) against bivalirudin, other brain operators or other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Moreover, it must not be used in patients who recently had a bloodorrhage, as well as people with strong hypertension or serious kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is a substitute for Heparin during treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd issued an approval for the incorporation of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">To treat adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (instabile angina / non-ST-uplift) (IA / NSTEMI)) with an emergency-attack or an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If an PCI is performed in another result, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion should be increased to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight, and an intravenous infusion with an dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and effectiveness of a sole bolt of Angiox is not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to below 225 seconds, a second layer of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">To reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the stimulated and diluted medicine should be carefully depleted and administered intravenously to the application.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg Infusionsdosis is properly administered.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether disputed with Bivalirudin against ACS), a lower infusion of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT score is below 225 seconds, a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose can be examined again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney compensation, which led to approval was included in the phase III- PCI study (replace-2), the ACT score was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dossier adaptation (366 ± 89 seconds).</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In cases with severe kidney compensation (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also with dialytic patients, Angiox is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients during the treatment are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bleeding especially when Bivalirudin is given in combination with another anticoagulans (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI-patients suffer from Bivalirudin most voltages in arterial points, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronization intervention (PCI), during the treatment of principled rings.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients with warfarin and are treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Normalised Ratio) should be drawn in consideration to ensure that the value returned to treatment with Bivalirudin again before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or platelets), these drugs can increase blood stress.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of Bivalirudin with platelets or anticoagulants, clinical and biological matics are regularly monitored in any case.</seg>

<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in treated comparisers in patients and in patients over 65 years were more common to unwanted events than for male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy blood vessels were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy blood tests as defined in Table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both lightweight and heavy bleeding came under Bivalirudin alone as well as in groups of heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">A ACUITY equation was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, hematular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point of surgery, hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 g / dl without obvious blood pressure, reduction of hemoglobinction of ≥ 3 g / dl with well known blood pressure control, reproduction due to hemorrhage, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>

<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in treated comparisers in patients and in patients over 65 years were more common to unwanted events than for male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both lightweight and heavy bleeding came significantly less than in Bivalirudin significantly less than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive application in practice and are listed in Table 6 according to system organism.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately discervated and the patient is close to monitor a hemorrhage.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombin inhibitor, both in the catalytic centre and in the anion binary region of THROMBIN binds, irrespective of whether THROMBIN is bound in the liquid phase or an indoor clause.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to THROMBIN, and thus its effect, is reversible, because THROMBIN gets slowly cunlocked to the binding of Bivalirudin-arg3-Pro4, thereby increasing the function of the active center of THROMBIN.</seg>

<seg id="2976">The European Commission granted the Commission of Sanofi-Aventis, Germany, approved the European Commission for the transport of apidra throughout the European Union in September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh, or subcutaneous caused by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose levels and the reduced insulin delivery, the insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with one restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of activity intensity, the brand (her- Steller), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinkovdelays etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturer method can move the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage, or the termination of a treatment, in particular for patients with a insulinable diabetes, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin for a different manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may be required to change the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin, thus changes to the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase the blood sugar levels increase and increase cordiabetic activity, aniotensin-converting enzymes, psychoxetine-converting enzymine, propoxypha, propoxyphes, salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathy, such as Betabblockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserve the symptoms of adrenergen should be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies have no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if inulin lulisins exceeds the human milk, but in general insulin does not occur in the breast milk, nor does it resorates after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following clinical studies are listed with clinical trials, grouped according to systemorganism and subordinated, ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare (frequency on basis of existing data is unpredictable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold, cold and blowing skin, tiredness, nervousness or Tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion, confusion, excessive, concentration problems, headache, nausea and heart knock.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is failed to change the injection of injection within the injection unit, in consequence, a Lipodystrophie may occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness can be given by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), or by an intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a Glucagonal adjection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to convey the Ur- item for serious hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood glucose levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose levels (especially through skeleton muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose levels in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that during subcutaneous Gaisbe of insulin, the mode of action occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than in hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes melli- tus inferinglulisin in therapeutic aggregate dosing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more are a disproportional increase of the glucose tolerance effect, exactly as Huminsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast drugs as normal human insulin and persisted the complete glucosmic effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than Huminsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Data from the data was evident that at an application of catmandinglulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable postpranal glycemic control is reached, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If, Insulinglulisin was taken in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranal control was given by human teinsulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control as in human teinsulin, which is given 2 Mi- Nuts before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">At the beginning of the meal, the consinglulisin with gift of the meal was given in the meal 2 minutes (GLULISIN - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (picture 1A) as well as compared to human teinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">In gift of the meal, insulin-lulisin, after the beginning of the meal, after the beginning of the meal, the 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) was given before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
