the distinctive feature of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists in it , used folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree @-@ Map . each object is propor@@ tional to its size . this size must have the property , that the sum of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects is smaller or equal the size of the object .
if you are looking for the size of a file or folder , the size of a file size is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in this way . according to this way , great files can be easily detected , even if it is located far down in the folder hier@@ archy . according to this way , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you will be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the bottom line display that represents a file or a file in your files@@ ystem . for easier navigation use the rec@@ tang@@ ent colour and label settings .
the color of an angle checks that is switched over viewing mode , can be either depth for the light detection of the f@@ ect or picture of another file maker , such as name , owner , group or MIME type .
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can define if it is displayed at all ( where there is sufficient space for display ) . in addition , you can specify the relative positions of the marking in the right angle .
in the case algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ e@@ aps the rule should be maintained , that the area is propor@@ tional to the size of the entries , and this setting is not always at your disposal . consider that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ t@@ angle is square .
like att@@ ending the area of a single entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation depends on it . here it is possible for the ri@@ p and to avoid plac@@ ements that are as square as possible . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second .
you can define the minimum surface for an entry on the menu entry list . instead , a pre@@ mixed sample is drawn into the area of the parent place , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .

another mode is better suited to directly convert from a picture series . then you will navigate the first pictures automatically to the compar@@ is@@ ons . use the left mouse button in any screen display , in order to display it in the right side . this is simplified in the right area . this is simplified by a number of similar images .
of course the normal loading actions also work directly from the illumin@@ ant like F4 file works ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both screen@@ shots in the illumin@@ ated table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you find a built @-@ in Sw@@ iv@@ elling function , which you bend to the crossed arrows . in order to bend the visible area of the image , you need to click these and the L@@ MB ; then both photos will be shown in the same picture area .
the zoom also works like in other views . simply use the zoom control in the images or Ctrl ; mouse wheel to perform in the image and get zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you are viewing the mode .
what is a digital stock management - part of the process that has been shot every part of the process since the image has been shot up to the final volume and the permanent storage . any of the photos stored , sc@@ anned or digital photos does not make a form of digital components . but most of us do this not make system@@ atic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , you will find a set and practical tips how to back up your pictures , download , protecting and use photos . we will consider the download , ren@@ aming , remove , ass@@ ess , ass@@ ess , optimize , waiting , and export image files .

met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined according to your definition data , information about or documentation of other data , which are managed by applying or environment .
I do not claim to claim any more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know more or dig@@ ic@@ am ; then use the met@@ ad@@ ata to store in a database as well as in the image files , then use it as well as in the image files you can easily access using other programs , platforms , and formats .
the first what you do and know what to maintain in your system is the construction of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether you want to save the preferred drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; please ensure that you need to change to a bigger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly on the same place . if you can make enough pictures , then you will be able to use sign@@ atures like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; you will then use a folder for pictures which you print or publish on a website .
professional photographer have other requirements like e.g. ver@@ sion@@ ing images , arch@@ iving , running processes , constant enlargement of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will not want to re@@ organ@@ ise your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes st@@ acking stra@@ ins easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and desktop files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata &apos; to store the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; to activate it . if you forget that EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data can be written in the file , then you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database to select the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? do &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; them provide a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected at@@ tributes . these are of course the most important .
well , the real work starts since you need to as@@ sign and create a review . of course , you can select all images you need the same at@@ tribute and then select the value . you will start best with the evaluation or ranking . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos .
let us now start with j@@ ig@@ ures , key@@ word such as you are on in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import from a different source with embedded j@@ ig@@ s , then &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; automatically add the tree to the right place . the changing words within the tree is not done . the changed keywords are done by &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; updated while using the trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata are cut out . this is a very rough representation of each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth in many sections . filen@@ ames and calendar data consists of all images .
enough of Key@@ words - the next section rel@@ ates to labels or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they just want to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are safe to arrive like your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . then you &apos;ll take a closer look at some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; In the French Norm@@ andy 60 years after landing , memories , the historical time span is again present , you might even listen to the silence . so , you can even listen to the silence . the lab@@ eling has changed completely .
for other the photos , the title is perhaps more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember the key that you moved on with the motive that you can understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect when the starch has only a label for themselves alone .
with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you can also use a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , they can even export a sp@@ elling of images . you will even export it to your wishes and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system . you will need to tell the story for a second time .
do you remember the days before GPS ? when you had to find out in another city without GPS navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with photos the train shows the spati@@ al presentation now already with light speed .
you can imagine the Geol@@ ocation , and will be able to finish in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can easily capture your travels through images with geograph@@ ical specifications . you can also export your travels to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; using the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of removing cop@@ y@@ rights to remove restri@@ ctions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the furnis@@ hing page of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; should be stored as information :
author ( Syn@@ onym for Cre@@ ators and author ) : this field should be created your name , or name the name of the photographer , for example , if it is not w@@ ished for the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization is not changed . this field does not support Com@@ mas or Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
author itel ( syn@@ onym for author of the author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples for this can be title as a freelance photographer , freelance photographer , or American photographer , must be filled this subject .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors ) : do you use the provider to identify who wants to identify the photo . if the picture has a picture agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , this can be seen here . if the picture is a warehouse photo , then here the group / agency will display the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they don &apos;t have any protection against mis@@ use . anyone looking for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pro@@ s this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; will provide such a module for st@@ ack@@ able processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or fire . this type of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting st@@ ats , which causes an data loss .
to combat the problem in CDs / DVDs they have to be treated with more than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives quality . of course , you can claim more difficult and more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 that have caused a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you feel it is in your meas@@ ur@@ able space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good discre@@ et and good capture devices . the best DVD capture devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you &apos;re writing much more reliable . so it &apos;s about selecting the right way .
CDs and DVDs are very vul@@ ner@@ able for mist@@ akes , even if you just have written exactly . therefore , they use only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum@@ mers . despite this massive protection , they are needed by chemical age@@ ing , ultra@@ violet light , cr@@ at@@ zer , dust , etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster that works as a model program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster . it works with Windows and Linux ; but there is also similar applications that are damaged by damaged disks , hard drives , flash@@ media , USB drives , etc .
visual media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to store the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus said almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that &apos;s on CDs and DVDs , this also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burning you slowly with a good capture of high quality media in a not propri@@ etary format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author labels and afterwards in a clean , dark dry and prior to animals protected site . do not forget the data on the next generation of hardware or software that can read these media .
dis@@ cer@@ y will keep your statistics for themselves . your company &apos;s anti@@ ques com@@ prise a new disk , but not the data . Google is among this topic a large field study on the trouble mechanism of hard disks : dis@@ mis@@ erst@@ ated
soon : Dis@@ ks stay in the temperature of 35 ° C to 45 ° C in the temperature of temperature . electronic parts of the Control@@ lers are the most common cause of error , SM@@ ART . these are the most common fault of the Control@@ lers . these are particularly read@@ able error . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete missed due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also use data loss due to a power failure , but these losses might be recovered without any major problems .
while most electric devices could not expect too much , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed problems . thus , these an@@ om@@ al@@ ies may cause serious damage , destroyed mot@@ her@@ boards and other defects . thus protecting yourself against a loss of time and money .
the most spread protected against black@@ heads is an over@@ load protection . this is a device absor@@ bed and the rest is gro@@ unded . it is usually printed in the form of a plug bar . but remember that not each plug bar also contains an over@@ load protection .
if you are looking for a sur@@ ge protection , then you should consider the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum of protection . they should also be careful to protect against bl@@ ink and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since there is an over@@ voltage of any cable to your computer , you should also ensure that all peri@@ pher@@ als which are connected to your system . they also offer a telephone line for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and the TV map .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a number of these devices are especially developed for not@@ eboo@@ ks and therefore you also contain the protection for the modem . this makes it ideal for the road .
while over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller weak@@ ness in the power cables , it can lead to loss of un@@ fe@@ as@@ ible data in a matter of seconds . it can therefore be mean@@ ing@@ ful to invest in an inter@@ ru@@ p@@ tible power supply .
besides the protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can be automatically set up battery energy when a power failure occurred . if you want to store your data and keep up to the stream . if you have a UPS , it is also able to keep the same quality requirements like a sur@@ ge protection . in addition , the life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
give away the potential risk to get your computer system and get rid of your safety during power dis@@ orders with costs for avo@@ iding this . a high quality ratio is available for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference when you keep your computer . at the end you should always think all the cables to tr@@ ate before you arrive in your holidays .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save them as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer with which you can save data .
however , in comparison to the hard drives , they cost very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . moreover , you must send data over the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore appropriate as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . for this it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to check your pictures in the case of Flick@@ r . for 25 $ a year you will get unlimited memory , which should be ver@@ ified only in reality .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are automatically adjusted . data transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the large companies is included in the supply and a distributed memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ able .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are pr@@ one for transmission errors . the file system is at least secure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred . all these errors remain un@@ covered until you have not discovered any protection in your computer . no one seems to have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much saf@@ er data away than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss because they create inter@@ ference in data stre@@ ams . in normal files@@ ystem the mist@@ akes remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mist@@ akes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates up and highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many pat@@ ents and is available under one of the GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows is available .
Oracle has started an initiative with its flexible file system . it is still using the alpha state . it is used to use the same protection mechanisms and is also available for &amp; Linux . but it is still not part of the core .
don &apos;t under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at the work@@ station systems . at not@@ eboo@@ ks the proportion of the@@ ft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the Me@@ ists think . it is limited to a minor damage , e.g. the@@ ft or no@@ vel@@ ations . Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer could be sigh@@ ted .
open Source files@@ ystems are less pr@@ one to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to the common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent sc@@ ru@@ pts data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the study process at a sud@@ den break during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is not saved before the problem came up , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , the@@ ft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are being removed from 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . is that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go out in the direction of the 10 Meg@@ apixels . even if this resolution has already been too high for compact cameras and a high @-@ quality look , the optimum temperature for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a full@@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive will be charged today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do you leave anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a plan and test this f@@ use before you are any dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of discs or the size change of hard drives .
supp@@ ose you take your securities on an external SATA drive . if , if one day , flash hits you happiness when the drive is not connected in the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget an air@@ plane : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ ft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the whole house .
therefore des@@ ast@@ er@@ oom always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighbor@@ ing house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as stated above it is a common reason for a data loss despite f@@ use the pan@@ ic . if you don &apos;t have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
a complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be backed up . it is a sn@@ ap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at one time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete reference sn@@ ap@@ pers to two points : the full backup and the last difference insurance .
incre@@ mental backup : the backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . created several sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can re@@ produce the original status at any time . this f@@ use comes from a ver@@ sion@@ ate system in the next with the exception that it is only tuned and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool which allows you to set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer files , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed . this happens and if you want to increase safety via ssh .
secure an important pictures directly after you stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you &apos;ll be able to use a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment of reference for a month and a sn@@ ap@@ shot during each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have done a complete review .
topics : IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , original re@@ tained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ mod@@ elling images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , vis@@ it@@ devices , ... , use of the Internet .
thus valuable images that survive next 40 years is about the time span in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that you should be respec@@ ted :
since the future is not predic@@ table because of your nature , you have to look at once with caution . unfortunately , there is no other way to gain . unfortunately , you should ask yourself as a certain system down@@ ward . if less varieties you have used in the past , then it is easier to evalu@@ ate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered with ex@@ plan@@ ations in this document . use and switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to reading your picture , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : all your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format may change , and if necessary to convert your library and if necessary to update a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist card for the possibility to change a system in its size . that is actually always enlarge .
let us assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with the input and you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * n@@ ix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and put it on a new record :
check the dm@@ es@@ g command if your new record was detected on the system , but do not depend on it .
&amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; Dollar ; part@@ ed Re@@ size / dev / S@@ DC &amp; Dollar ; part@@ ed Re@@ size / dev / sd@@ d ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ er@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software there can read it , then you can create this self . this task will be easier by year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . it should therefore no longer use it .
PNG was developed as an open source standard and it should be a lot more . it is highly fre@@ ed@@ ented , supported by X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . the dis@@ advantage is that there are relative importance of administrative forms , but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression . this format will we recommend you to store your pictures .
TIFF was very common as a picture format . TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ sy @-@ free compression rate . it is also possible to store your pictures in this format . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital neg@@ atives file format is an licensed and open media format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the needs of the camera formats . it is based on the demand of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera producer is already available now and we hope to use the compet@@ itors Canon and Nikon as well .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe is launching its XML based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP is used for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; -@@ Technology to receive their data into a file itself . the file information is allowed with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; is stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to archive a original of your photo , mostly in the raw format , to arch@@ ived . X@@ MP is able to extract separately from the image file and as described above , it may use whether you use DNG as containers and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata initiative is an open organization that supports a large range of application purposes and models , which is a wide range of applications and mod@@ elling , discussion and community work in the DC@@ MI @-@ Communities and the DC@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and emerging efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are on the camera size , you can use that as a temporary backup .
convert blank files to DNG and save them in your re@@ pository . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fin@@ ish@@ able processing you can use external programs . edit the pictures back with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut down by the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright law with a digital water@@ mark . simply export it into web@@ g@@ aler@@ ien , then use in MPEG , you will use in contact , print &amp; etc ..
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you can add a description on your hard disk . you can already add some advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; connect this with the computer , switch the camera on display mode and switch them . another description of this you can find in the manual of your camera .
when you launch the camera @-@ interface , it will be possible to connect with your camera . if this is the case , a distance of the indic@@ ator appears at the bottom and the th@@ umb@@ nails displayed on the camera . some cameras do not display the filen@@ ames and a symbol for File , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you need to get the camera information on each entry . using the features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera @-@ interface , you can see the properties of a single entry or met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the prints stored in the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . NOTE that there will not be any information available for a few digital cameras .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata like EX@@ IF , manufacturer of packages , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; or the picture processing . NOTE that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras .
the eas@@ iest way to download photos from your camera is click on the button to download and then download all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted before you can delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the desired option with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button to download and then select selected . the button is selected as long as you have selected , until you have selected few photos .
if your camera supports this , you can download the new option again . these pictures are not yet purchased by &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; . in this case , the new images have been selected by a star in the show@@ case . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you are downloading the buttons , select a dialog box , with which you can select the target album , displayed in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums can be found in the section my albums . please select the list album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the album album , press OK , and dig@@ ic@@ am ; invites the pictures from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of them out by clicking on the button . if you only want to delete a few , then you must select this first and then delete selected items .
please note that there are no way to recover from the camera , you &apos;ll be able to recover from the camera , before you want to delete it from the camera , before you want to delete it from camera . if you want to delete it from camera . if you want to delete it from camera , it should be done faster than downloading the camera .
cameras use as a file name for the photos often not especially mean@@ ing@@ ful names . the filen@@ ames can usually be deleted after the pictures are stored in the same album . therefore , it can be mean@@ ing@@ ful , the date and time , at which the picture was taken , into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for turning and ske@@ wer @-@ based sub@@ bases . if you use this latter , you automatically create a folder a day .
the options while transmission opens three more options to be done before the photos stored on the record . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF data in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another date format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . switch the option time &amp; time . for more adap@@ tions you should read the command of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the possibility to change the file name in lo@@ wer@@ case , or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the dig@@ ic@@ am ; is used for a picture below the name , is stored below the name , when your settings are stored in preview , and automatically , if you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; can use all information about orientation of camera to cycle time . not all cameras call this information . in section Met@@ ad@@ ata you can find more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , you can turn on it ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic turn and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
if your camera is made information about the date where the picture was made available , and dig@@ ic@@ am ; this one can be downloaded on the picture data . all images from the same date will be downloaded onto the picture data . in the section side bar Met@@ a data you can consult which information about your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally disabled ; and in this case , dig@@ ic@@ am ; the photos will change directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button extended and select the Date Date Bas@@ ed at the bottom of the window .
the eas@@ iest way to download photos from your computer to the camera is to download . select File selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that you should be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file using standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the picture selection is done , asks &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you , where the pictures will be up@@ loaded . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted by your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in length and lat@@ itude . the identification of the data can be displayed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographs , it can be interesting to link an air@@ plane with a precise ge@@ ography . not everyone uses an air@@ plane in order to car@@ ve an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you for@@ got later , where exactly the photo was made , you can send a postcard to another browser which allows you to loc@@ ate the location of the photos , or simply want to loc@@ ate the location of the photos it is good to en@@ rich the position data of a photos .
the question is , just like coming the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map reference . there are at least three ways to reach this . right with the right hardware , via a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geograph@@ ic classification ( manual ) and most of the manual input from unknown locations .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera , which has integrated GPS unit . but there are a couple of working with GPS rec@@ eivers . either as card module or via transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Kodak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . but you need to store this data in g@@ px format as it is the only format that is supported by the module to the geograph@@ ic classification .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ related the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and lat@@ itude code or other data , you can use this script that will be used with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey , which can be used by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European roads . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , all navigation details for Europe show .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; try to give you much control over his work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to set up on these settings ; select the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
action can be set on embedded preview or edit video editing . Set the default behavior of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the ar@@ ardi@@ ability and copyright data . these data is automatically selected in the relevant IP@@ TC data fields . the data is also written in the IP@@ TC market .
aut@@ um@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should be the job title of photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer look at the author , this field must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors : use this field to enter the photo . then this is not the author here if it is a picture agency like e.g. Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then this image should be shown here . then , if the picture is a warehouse photo , then the group and the agency must be listed here .
the IP@@ TC action store data into the appropriate IP@@ TC rim . this means that met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently included in the image and not just in the database of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; imported without lost without lost .
image lab@@ elling as in@@ embedded lab@@ elling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images store : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos using the images embedded in the images . thus , your lab@@ elling can also be read by the images that are already written by the pieces of dig@@ ic@@ am ; over@@ ning it .
the page settings contains all options for the information which appear when the mouse po@@ inter can be displayed in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed , or not .
&amp; # 160 ; dig@@ ic@@ am ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; language is att@@ empt@@ ed , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove any of these extensions , by &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; igno@@ red .
the default settings can be reset again by press the button up@@ dating right from each category .
the settings of the brightness of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , if you do not have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode , you should only have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get a better results .
by default , the processing modif@@ ication has a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can turn it down here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the picture processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and coated areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the image . these colors are defined here . in the picture processing , this view can be set out with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the pictures are coded in higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance as in the colour form@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation .
with the setting of PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG @-@ files . this operation does not decrease the image quality as PNG a los@@ sy blade . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value to a high compression . 1 : a low and 9 means a high compression .
with the option TIFF @-@ files comp@@ ress you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression f@@ g@@ gle for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF @-@ images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ m is fun@@ ic@@ eless .
with the adjustment of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can select loss without loss . even if you have written the loss of quality loss and file size better than in normal JPEG . when this article was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not supported yet , but was in the planning process .
in the earlier versions of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; it was only a picture @-@ viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool for manip@@ ulating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the editing settings .
the default user is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option in sensitive to ultra@@ violet light . this option del@@ ays a little bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G- or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance is used simultaneously . otherwise , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a solid colour balance , which is based on a white card that is reflected in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras . the effect of the second sensors will have the effect that under@@ lined images in four steps . for other cameras , this option is igno@@ red .
the standard is the pointed star , so the parts of your camera is to begin to capture the pointed out white in the settings . the setting colors are trig@@ gered by some unusual patterns , as it can produce the pointed out of various ros@@ es . finally , you can try to con@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the hair@@ lights .
this is possible because blue pixels is generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; and d@@ cra@@ b try to re@@ con@@ struct the missing green and red parts of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a matter how many color or white you want .
if you select the option re@@ constructed , you will get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three com@@ promise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you &apos;ll probably have to put it somewhat higher than the Standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; pic @-@ editing . in order to keep the time for the demo b@@ ale , you should be conserv@@ ative .
a de@@ men@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorith@@ m is a digital image process to obtain a complete image from the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which have many cameras and which have a Matrix @-@ coloured pixels . these algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ on@@ struction .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; and D@@ cra@@ w make you three altern@@ atives to you : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests , it was the first algorith@@ m used by d@@ cra@@ b . it creates color arti@@ facts on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable score .
if you &apos;re familiar with the colour devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ ting values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour correction .
a profile transl@@ ates the color form@@ ations and returns instructions how they should be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and dig@@ ic@@ am ; information such as the color space of a color space in the other so are the colours as possible .
behaviour questions , if a picture is opened in the image processing module with raw files .
color Profile file S@@ ing here to store the folder , like / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you all save your profile . &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; then exam@@ ines the folder then during start .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the way &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile you can change . everything can be changed later on opening the raw file .
the colour management panel is an alternative to X@@ cal@@ ib or Arg@@ on@@ yl . here just your pictures are not managed on the whole screen .
the input profiles should be made to the camera producer and model which you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . currently there are no color m@@ apping or gamma @-@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not necessary to perform conver@@ sions of 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the colour m@@ apping itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your printer has been given back . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your camera and some colors , so you could manually correct , rather than to the blind algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious that the color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not for the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ officially :
the Canon profile extension makes the style to recogn@@ ise : F for an exact style , L for Land@@ scapes , N for Ne@@ utral , P for Ne@@ utral , P for the Standard Style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewed and image processing ; many modules supported , which have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your di@@ str@@ o has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . then , select a list of available modules . then , these modules are displayed as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some of the menu navigation menu .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be seen through the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ in .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjusted the time between the images of the screen , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other anch@@ oring off turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all the cameras supported . on the right side up , a button is connected to identify which the camera is connected to identify and in screen mode . including , there are serial port settings , USB and USB / FireWire mass storage here .
at the bottom of the bottom you can use the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ link ) . this field is only active when you have chosen a US@@ B- or FireWire har@@ ram camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Check your camera .
to use your digital camera with dig@@ ic@@ am ; you need to connect the camera to your computer to set it in the display mode .
check out if &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set up camera and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here .
the option of confir@@ ming dialog for the shif@@ ting of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash bin can display the talk of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; while del@@ eting a photos in an album , you can find further details .
the ed@@ itorial changes through the right side bar can be used in silence by &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any return . otherwise , you need to apply the changes with the button changes .
you can also make the display of the welcome screen of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; at the starting computer . this acceler@@ ates under the starting procedure of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ;
the attitude adjustment in the start to new photos search &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; the basic folder for new or deleted albums / photos . if something from the basic folder was deleted , asks &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you will delete it from the database .
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can select from the tool@@ bar settings . a preview of available design is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in writing a new design for &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; contains a quick processing with some basic tools . you can use these photos to view and fix your photos and add @-@ on to the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the video clip .
the processing modif@@ ication includes a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them stand as modules in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; they are not part of your di@@ str@@ ation . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section of sculpt@@ or .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the filen@@ ame , current file number , enlar@@ ation factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at upper edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
the editing functions change your photos . don &apos;t change the original photo before you have to store Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . NOTE that you can &apos;t use the original photo as soon as you have stored the image .
so you should possibly send a copy of your image before you change it . you can save and save .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu or restore image processing into the tool@@ bar . you lose any change in which you have done in the photo since last Stor@@ ing .
almost any action of the processing processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last promotion you can und@@ o and re@@ und@@ o by editing advice or re@@ create re@@ produce from the menu .
if you use this often , use the keyboard short@@ cut , Ctrl ; -@@ z to re@@ treat and Ctrl ; -@@ Um@@ s@@ alt @-@ Z to be used .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; push the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions are also und@@ one or restored .
once you have launched the picture processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or entries in the menu , you are asked if you want to save them .
you can print and cut out in the photo using Ctrl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu .
to fit a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select a magn@@ ification factor .
view Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you will be able to use the Es@@ c key . if you don &apos;t want to use the button dialog . if you don &apos;t want to call this in the setup dialog by &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you can see this in the setup dialog . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the image you can print the picture , select the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings , before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or all pro@@ positions . all images can be printed out of your choice . you just need to select the images from your choice . you just need to follow the wiz@@ ard , just need your choice .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which is available with important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side bar is available , without the navigation sp@@ reading , even if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple click on the same riders will be appearing on the side@@ bar and disappear again in the edge .
in the label screen , you can enter or insert lab@@ elling with unlimited size or insert it . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields to be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut according to the 2000 characters . if you want to use IP@@ TC in@@ scription in other applications , you should notice that limit@@ ations .
after you comment it , use either the button to use or switch to the next picture , the lab@@ elling will then be stored .
besides the using button there is a button more . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also use the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . however , this will always be conducted if you have written a met@@ ad@@ ata setting that will always be written in the images .
the section valuation shows a value scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting . it can be applied with a single click on the 5 stars onto the top bar , or with the keyboard short@@ est Ctrl + 0 ... 5 . to rate this , choose from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field urg@@ ency . coding of encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the head@@ note view shows a key@@ box to the fil@@ tering of the keywords , the j@@ aw and a selection box with those previously used in this &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; session .
the sample tree is customized according to a specified search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief after input j@@ ig@@ ures at a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be set through marking the relevant fields in the tree . all keywords are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the sample tree , this will be applied to the high@@ lighted picture , if you wish to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section j@@ aw filter .
the Re@@ ar Slide Strip is used to change the selection of the display in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , Key@@ word and search settings . if additionally , one or more key@@ word filter is used on the right side , only the cutting volume of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also pull and let off . supp@@ ose you have chosen more pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can move it out from the right side bar and on the choice . then , a dialog is asked if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example shows the main window the images on a calendar day . the sample filter has been reduced to no keywords . they were picked with Str@@ g + a and then saved there a key@@ word from the right query tree to the selection and dis@@ car@@ ded there . a dialog is asked if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings .
if you have a rule with and creates and determine that it is a must or be , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control range .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which in the database is sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : argument to the operator , which is a name or a string that is already placed in the database .
for example , you can define an Advanced Search about all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check@@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options look as follows :
why are Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution there .
this article / tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have adapted it mainly to &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; s specific implementation .
the reason why one is one of the colors of your camera or scanners from actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . you can easily print that colors on your monitor or scanners from your camera or scanners are identical to you or in the web with them from your digital dar@@ k@@ chamber .
if the subject comes on colour management , then everyone wants to know which buttons must be made for the results that he would like to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management work@@ flows . in addition , you will give you sufficient information to make your own informed decisions to make the desired outcome .
if your work@@ work@@ flow performed every six below , you must not take care of color management .
you work on a monitor that calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other aspect issues are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for all so easy , why would you use another color space and thus have to worry about color spo@@ ons ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the dirty region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB With some larger colour spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ently and click on info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
I have to C@@ out@@ i my monitor , when I decided to work in the s@@ RGB color space ?
Yes ! if you are working in s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to find your monitor from s@@ RGB , as s@@ RGB running on s@@ RGB mode , then you need to use it as a color space of s@@ RGB , then you need to use a monitor on the s@@ RGB @-@ standard or both a suitable mon@@ itor@@ profile .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can make a picture in most cases . use it before you try to progress further manually .
the functions norm@@ alize , equal , automatic and contrast extending from the menu correct and automatically expand your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see what &apos;s best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scal@@ ed the final value over the entire image , so the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without sh@@ ades . this feature is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
like : this method adjust@@ s the ligh@@ tening factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity values is as flat as possible . this means that the fact that the hist@@ ogram of intensity is produced as flat as possible . it is a very powerful operation , which makes either mir@@ acles in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic down : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue canal . they determined the dark and bright bound@@ ary and adjusted the rot@@ ten , green and blue channels in the complete hist@@ o@@ gram@@ med range .
contrast extended : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of RGB values of a picture by the move the lowest and highest possible values in between each possible range and one re@@ ji@@ ust@@ ation of all values in between . this is only visible with selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; is a semi automatic tool to perform the white balance of an pictures .
the white @-@ off correction is something limited to a color space of 8 bit per color . if you are able to run away from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you operate the white balance in raw mode , your ways are able to respond better in 16 @-@ bit mode .
this tool is based on a white balance sheet that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start it on the menu entry of white balance .
the show@@ case can be adjusted in the size . on the left hand , both the original image and the preview of the target image are adapted . the preview can be regarded as the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ eboard you want to click on the screen .
the view photos has a red mar@@ kers . the lumin@@ ance of Pix@@ els under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram displayed that as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very useful , even in well lit pictures , most Pixel will have very small Lumin@@ isc@@ ence . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or their sum will be displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . sh@@ adows you can enhance or down the attend@@ ance details of your photos or down .
An@@ st@@ at with the above controls around you should use the color temperature pip@@ ette . press this button and then on the image preview for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed indicator increases the colours , if more than a color channel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save and store exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be stored into a text file and load later .
the button pres@@ ets rec@@ alls all the filter values again on their default values and the associated neutral white balance . NOTE that also neutral settings will be displayed as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the co@@ di@@ ets per colour channel of the machined image format . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images , but this encoding is also needed for high @-@ quality images . this coding , calcul@@ ating time and stands only for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool will open the same dialog like the editing of shell profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour m@@ apping can be performed by the sub@@ windows for the use of color profiles .
another important tool in the menu is available in the menu under colors . this tool allows you to store a built @-@ in way to adjust for several colour channels simultaneously . this is helpful if you need the same problem and therefore you &apos;ll always find the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct equ@@ il@@ ibri@@ um is the tool for the gra@@ dation that you will find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool colour@@ ing effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and a can@@ ister filter available .
in times of chemical processing , also Sab@@ at@@ ite is called , an effect that was developed by the light of a short flas@@ hing . this had the effect that the ligh@@ ten diff@@ ers have been reduced by the second lighting . the result was a part negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
intensity in intensity . with about 50 % intensity , the image shows the image which is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally trig@@ gered a negative image that is not to be used on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited version ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation , that he has a stronger contra@@ sting effect the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a film which is made from the Japanese company Fuj@@ if@@ ilm is made . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via provides very saturated color but also some photographs , especially those are hardly imag@@ ined , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ Filter sim@@ ulates a tend@@ ency on the contrast monitors . the parameter level controls the magn@@ itudes of the results and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the Neon . for large images , the filter can strain the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to modify the color counter and the brightness of your photos using the tools in the menu below colors . all of your Just@@ ys you can look at the preview . once you are happy with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a good choice rather than to increase the satur@@ ation instead of increasing them . all the changes you can do in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple le@@ uch@@ y / contrast / Gamma , the tool can be very complicated . even if the dialog for this tool can be very complicated , you need only the range of the sli@@ ders just below the area of the ti@@ pping . specifically , the three shift under@@ ne@@ ath the hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ms .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active can@@ als or the selected area . below the graph , three sl@@ aves are cli@@ cked into the graph and the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright area .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn to learn to post@@ p@@ one the controller and respect it , how the image changes .
on the right hand you can see the original and the preview of the picture . the preview can be updated , with the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
scal@@ ing : with this selection box , the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is displayed . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic scale is useful .
three knob : the su@@ preme for the dark tones , the mean for the bright tones and the bottom for the medium tones , is frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color brush applic@@ ants can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the sh@@ adows , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for an entirely automatic adjustment .
output values : the selection values for each range . there are also two controller to change the output values . for example , the compression values can be used , for example , the compression values can be used for example , as a background to create something different in the background .
automatically : with this button the image values will be automatically set depending on the intensity values .
save as well as loading : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in files@@ ystem and later re@@ charged . the Gim@@ p levels is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pip@@ et , you will be able to use the font pip@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview values of the hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ms for red , green , blue , and lighting channels .
the F@@ exposure compensation regulation checks all the color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is what you &apos;ll see the effect on a preview only and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below , a sample for adjustment of the input values used on the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , and output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the revised image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamic in depend@@ ency of your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modif@@ ier channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel depending on the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with a digital camera , the linear mode of a constant colour produces a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move an injection valve to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that bright tones can be a dar@@ ker and the corresponding image pixel dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos it is to see a red mark . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original score . create a point on this line and move it on and down , until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you can have generated this file system and later up@@ loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p cur@@ v@@ format .
if you are using this method and the three colour pip@@ et buttons automatically create the control points for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun block . select the color pip@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for red , green , blu@@ e- and Lumin@@ esc@@ ence .
the option covers all color channels , to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you &apos;ll get the combined result . this is what you can see the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was correc@@ ted in the Lumin@@ isc@@ ion channel . shadow and sun bulb was applied to the colour pip@@ ette and the original image is ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing is a tool to enhance the color channels , or change the colour sh@@ ades of the photographs .
the channel @-@ Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu of the colours channel bl@@ ender .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels . the left section of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison to its own rider .
the preview image has a red marker . if you position this in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to indicate the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : regulator for red , green and construction allows you to dis@@ able these channels . if you want to dis@@ able this channel , the image will also be able to reduce the power tool for the generation of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portra@@ its .
sometimes , especially when you are Monochrome , the reduction of a color@@ ation comes from a visible noise that occurs from the same spot in colour channel . if this is the case , you can improve your mono@@ chrome conversion into which you could reduce the colour space first .
saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any any type of bl@@ ender options allow you to save and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the F@@ exposure compensation regulation checks all the color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is what you &apos;ll see the effect on a preview only and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a photo shown in the Blue channel . the Lumin@@ ance option has been enabled . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) .
black / white photograph was always fascinating because of your ab@@ str@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step step , as color pictures can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ cut with a green lens filter . it looks great when all the scenes and fits very well into the sky . so similar to the 004 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ien@@ ter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ cut with a orange relief filter . this improves landscapes , marit@@ ime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ien@@ ter .
rot@@ ors : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ cut with a red lens filter . thus created dramatic an@@ a@@ ids and can sim@@ ulate the moon lights for the day time . so , like the 003 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ er .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film @-@ cap with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 coil ( t@@ m ) light filter .
Se@@ pi@@ aton : creates hot bright and medium tones for a bit of cold in the sh@@ ades . this is very similar to the process of a print and re@@ development in a pi@@ pi@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) .
using the dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool tex@@ ture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a tex@@ ture to your image , regardless of whether it is a colour picture or not , you can look like a painting on a screen , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry picture tex@@ ture can be used for that .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimensional of the tex@@ ture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
with the dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool framework , a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
the eye of an Bet@@ rach@@ is in the borders of a photos is no easy task . to re@@ tain the picture of a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be started .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . tran@@ sc@@ ary the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , c@@ ashed it with a very thin three @-@ dimensional setting of the ideal accessory for a button effect and decor@@ atively add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : if the frame width is in percent . the range limit for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially when using the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple form@@ att@@ ed text into a picture . this also goes to several spots when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and the character set . at the end you will need to finish the character set . at the end you just need a frame to finish the text and / or a sem@@ i@@ bre background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture was saved once , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
using the dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool st@@ encil , you can put a template on a picture .
the menu image allows for use in the image processing can be used in order to put the image on a picture .
for the template , there is no restri@@ ctions on the size and orientation . if you want to add the template format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) . if you want to add a st@@ encil file format and should send us an e @-@ mail in English to the dig@@ ic@@ am ; mail list dig@@ ic@@ am @-@ Users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
when you use this tool for the first time , you have to set your st@@ encil folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder you will notice for the next start .
after the root folder for the templates has been set , a tree vision is reflected in the original structure of the st@@ encil folder . selecting a folder will update the st@@ up@@ tion of the templates .
you will find three buttons on which you can change the magn@@ ifying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the desired image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this knob shr@@ inks the image . if you want to use a template onto the whole picture , if you want to use a template onto the whole picture , check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move it : use this button to move it below the st@@ encil image . take the image and place it on the desired position .
do not use OK if you want to use the template onto your picture . then the image will be automatically adjusted .
dig@@ ic@@ am ; provides three different tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy to produce , particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
in@@ fer@@ ior mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not work to remove atmosph@@ er@@ ic Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken out of Gim@@ p and he is cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Chang .
focus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness . it is a little complicated in its application and has several parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ally visu@@ alised images require a correction of the sharpness that are combined with only minim@@ alist differences to a color point . the same characteristics will be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras will usually need more then suitable shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , some camera has been used to heat internal progress . images in the raw format should always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanner does a shar@@ pen@@ se filter already during the reading of the image . if you turn it , check out the control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by calling a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing thro@@ wing shar@@ pen@@ ing . this can be edited with the menu entry .
but they should be careful with caution when the results are not very natural , because the focus will focus on sharpness of the edges , but increasingly focus on the menu entry . they can be focused on the menu entry and further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to record the image is much easier than it is easier to focus and experiment something with the menu entry and experiment something with settings . the show@@ case on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp meas@@ ur@@ izing is a very good tool to remove ve@@ ils from your photos . a demonstration can you see here .
the original image and the preview helps to edit the image . a show@@ case shows the output of the filter with current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first . an increase in radius or amount intensi@@ fied the effect . if you increase the wrong mask , noise and get the impression of gr@@ ats near sharp edges .
the radius turns one how many pixels on each side of a edge is affected by the filter . high resolution images allow higher radi@@ i . you should see pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the p@@ amp@@ ered picture which is added to the original . thus the strength of the edge is set .
the threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB value and to apply difference amount . thus , this way can be applied with a soft switching between the killing of the shar@@ pen@@ es and thus avo@@ iding beauty ab@@ norm@@ s in shif@@ ters , belie@@ fs and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool re@@ foc@@ using focused on a picture by improving the edge . it used the copyright protected @-@ filter algorith@@ m by Ernst Lipp@@ e .
this tool tries to do a photo to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ using quot ; in which it is foc@@ using on a technique called FI@@ R Vienna fil@@ tering . it is used to boot better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ k@@ ware . you can start it from the menu by calling colors foc@@ uss@@ ing in the image processing .
in practice , the circular available is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; The F@@ altung . the rapid result is also influenced by the s@@ ourc@@ ecode , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel size . the FI@@ R Vienna version of the Gau@@ ß &apos; F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very strongly removed from remote pixel size .
this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the main parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . if your image should be very un@@ sharp , then , if your image should be very un@@ sharp .
cor@@ relation : the cor@@ relation can help produce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . depend@@ able values are 0,5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the cor@@ relation effect of the module .
coar@@ se filter : an increase of the pre@@ ference filter can help you reduce ar@@ tif@@ ical values . however , values are higher than 0.1 but only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still further dirty .
clarity : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; medium hot . use this parameter if your in@@ fer@@ mentation dice it is . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 if you should not use a value equal to zero , so you may also need to increase cor@@ relation and / or pre@@ ference filters .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ ge : this value determin@@ es the size of the transformation format to have good results , especially if you select a value for the circular sharpness or the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharpness , if you select a value for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value in the range from 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . each individual test focus will be placed for later and can be downloaded for later .
try to perform all the vie@@ wers , color and intensity car@@ ri@@ tures on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module , before you change the picture otherwise , the reason is that much operations are not immediately visible , but left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you can read and comp@@ ress pictures , eg . JPEG , you should apply the module on un@@ compressed picture .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ ks improve better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could cause this to shar@@ ply a bigger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , you must always need to remove arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it cannot display the effect of im@@ po@@ or@@ aries . for the Vien@@ nese filters you can also show the effect of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters as well as the wrong mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better with mach@@ ining of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp colour picture has to be correc@@ ted . this image has been taken with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused outcome is at@@ tribut@@ able to the Auto Focus lens .
for further information on methods to shar@@ pen@@ di@@ ec@@ or@@ rection in digital image , you can consult a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator is pus@@ hing the in@@ fer@@ mentation of the field of darkness to create a natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ted allows a modified color for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you like blue eyes instead of dark , you can set this here .
the tool @-@ error correction is one of the most developed tools needed to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented speed .
the In@@ ner Algorith@@ m was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS labor@@ atories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various prefer@@ ences than starting points to simp@@ lif@@ y the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the riders draw and advanced settings .
details p@@ ens@@ er &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value causes less homogen@@ eous regions of smooth and details . for example , a value of 0.9 should be necessary to ensure that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is not necessary . please refer to the detail main@@ tain@@ er .
dis@@ crete actuator Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions while being a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film piece or create a high value of well@@ - JPEG arti@@ facts are best placed at a value close to 1 .
smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this places the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ es@@ . p then define the relative humidity . thus add this value to the level of space in your image .
regul@@ ar@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns greater structures . the more this value is required , the more becomes more complex if it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ent effect , it must be higher than 3 .
rep@@ et@@ itions : there is how often the algorith@@ m go through . usually , there is 1 or 2 .
angle @-@ gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is chosen , it should also be small to produce a long term . so you should select this value as much as possible and for your needs .
integr@@ ale ste@@ pping distance &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral ped@@ ometer in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the multi @-@ quality you use by selecting this option is only small . it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to leave it .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later re@@ charged .
image errors is compar@@ atively very quick at work . however , it can take a very long time and yet a high CPU load . they can therefore break the calculation at any time with button pl@@ ump .
below you can see how image errors have been correc@@ ted with little ar@@ tif@@ ical products . as you can see , there is an independent black ar@@ tif@@ act in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad movie storage during the voyage was wur@@ del@@ .@@ The original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the fixed picture ( 2 ) .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; pre@@ beam is a very powerful tool to decrease picture noise . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool is available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , to remove . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ ire@@ ac@@ ute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor no@@ ises from digital cameras , you can read them in this tut@@ orial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny , which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you will need only the lower window details and the advanced settings may stay with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) needed for the filter . large values improve the time the filter per pixel and can be spo@@ iled for the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thereby smaller errors is adjusted .
sharpness : controls the focus level . this value sets the pixel pitch into the front line . if it is increased , sp@@ ong@@ es disappear when you need to change the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and pre@@ dat@@ ors or lubric@@ ating again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the edge . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot all the noise if you want to remove it at a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ e@@ factors .
illumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ous tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to enhance a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to enhance a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the G@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker ranges , which typically are stronger than increasing their own risk .
d@@ amping : control the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius at variations of the lumin@@ ance , when it is lifted up , a dec@@ ay can occur . if it is high , c@@ lash and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove pre@@ judi@@ ces and is the recommended method for it .
save under and store : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for pre@@ dat@@ tion that you have set can be stored into the files@@ ystem and later up@@ loaded .
this is an example of how tr@@ ash relief can change their lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the revised version ( 2 ) , with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . this solution makes it a bit soft to sign the image and experiment a lot more easier than an image entry and experiment with the sli@@ pper . the show@@ case on the right side of the di@@ alogs indicates the effect of this operation on your photo .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; photo re@@ stau@@ ration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease Photo@@ graphic file .
this filter for re@@ stau@@ ration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts to emer@@ ge in digital , original or night@@ life . the smo@@ othing is done along the image con@@ tours and thereby main@@ tains the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the tex@@ ture is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG ar@@ tif@@ ies reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ facts &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are visible in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should be correc@@ ted .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . each setting of photo @-@ restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo reproduction is compar@@ atively very quick at work . however , it can take a very long time and yet a high CPU load , so you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with rec@@ tif@@ ical noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that is taken on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera . you can see the not@@ or@@ ious film piece in the faces . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the revised version ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo reproduction . this time , Tex@@ tures were actually read on an old color photo that have been produced using a scanner . the original image is visible from the Sc@@ anners and the photo paper . this image is visible below ( 1 ) and the fixed picture ( 2 ) .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows different pixel size pixels using a CCD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels , especially when high quality raw mode is a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression has a built @-@ in supporting for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo using a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad Pix@@ els .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark picture . the tool will detect the hot and bright pixels . these are high@@ lighted in the image preview .
when you have an old digital camera , it is important that you have the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to correct image . NOTE that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically invites you in the next session .
the picture section and the preview can be correc@@ ted to you within the image shows the output of the filter with current settings . poor pixels are emphas@@ ized in all fore@@ stry dep@@ artments .
choose a area around the def@@ ective pixels at the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . this is the available filter :
dur@@ st : an average of the neighbor@@ ing pixel returns . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels pick up a distance of 1 of the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less on a pixel surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) are used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ isher pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel bug on a color photo , from a faul@@ ty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; Vign@@ et@@ al correction is a tool to correct the Vign@@ es@@ port , i.e. , exposed corners , one image .
wide angle lens , especially in the middle and large photo format , they often reach the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they often reach the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that indicates the sensor there .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many Center @-@ filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens , also with Center filter , a hole of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise in@@ fer@@ ment effects can be created through movement .
with the large exposure of modern film camera and colour camera models , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ less by sim@@ ulating an equivalent filter . the tool Vign@@ et@@ ening correction . the transformation using a Center@@ filter is applied on a picture . the algorith@@ m is protected by the copyright by John Walker .
with three re@@ gl@@ ers you can control the Vign@@ es@@ etting @-@ correction filter and with three further layers of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the level of light amplif@@ iers at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which means an optical filter with an aper@@ ture of 2 , or random@@ ly , reducing the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vign@@ es@@ etting .
glue strength , contrast and gamma -@@ settings : the beam of a picture with the Vign@@ es@@ etting @-@ correction will re@@ adjust the brightness of the target with these options . they need only positive values to adjust , because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er re@@ adjustment of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the gra@@ dation of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing from the menu of Color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ al correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ es@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a stronger beam and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; Linear dist@@ or@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colour acc@@ uses cannot be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ des handles the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion of lens and can correct the concave or conv@@ ex shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular @-@ effect , but flu@@ ctu@@ ating on the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient of gra@@ ves correc@@ ts the dist@@ ant corners opposite the second count . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric versions can be elim@@ inated almost elim@@ inated .
General : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion of the second grade . with negative values can be correc@@ ted t@@ onn@@ en@@ eous dist@@ or@@ tions and positive values of cal@@ der@@ ous dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion in the fourth degree . this value looks stronger along the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter illustr@@ ates the parameters of the parameter .
Zoom : this value scal@@ ed the image size and performs a correction of first gra@@ dation by negative values . negative values can be resi@@ zed while positive the image .
brigh@@ tly : this value is adjust@@ ing the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values indicate the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values it increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog mit a preview the dist@@ or@@ tion correction . the values you use for your picture are stored and used in the next start as default values .
the t@@ onn@@ - or rec@@ tif@@ ical correction should be done prior to all aud@@ iting or sizes of changes . in case you have to cut out a picture above all . in case you are able to cut a picture and then an error @-@ shaped correction would be the effect behind .
to help you find the best correc@@ ting you find this tool a vertical and horizontal environment line . move it to an important place , like e.g. the edge or a building wall in your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines on this site . in connection you can correct the t@@ onn@@ e- / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic dist@@ or@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cone @-@ like dist@@ or@@ tion , the resulting image will be black corners . you can remove them from the di@@ ver@@ id tool in the menu without cutting out the editing or on the zoom control .
for most pictures , the error @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some mot@@ ives as e.g. photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the all @-@ angle in the image 90 degrees . NOTE that when you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight dist@@ or@@ tion of a perspective .
this is an example of the spher@@ ical correction of a church in Norway . the original image is among ( 1 ) and the revised image ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method to sim@@ ulate the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which re@@ stores under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture .
below you can set two parameters for fil@@ let and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the iso controller changes the amount of a high sensitive film . the iso control is changing the amount of the film piece and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ oph@@ yll in nature ) in the transformation . green me@@ adows are white like snow !
since the filter is m@@ apped to the re@@ produce of infrared film , especially the Grün@@ canal does not make any sense the effect on black / white photos as the colour form@@ ations are missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ me@@ ek@@ ites applied to a landscape image from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the revised image under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of au@@ ra in the hair@@ lights .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter Film@@ piece is a simple to use tool to re@@ produce film piece like the B / W Kodak Tri @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of films to increase the manufacturers great silver @-@ grain of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ proof effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears in the past . the treated picture gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere . if you want to see this special , gallery @-@ like , street photograph@@ ic , gra@@ iny , especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , though often higher values are needed , if you need more gra@@ ins , so you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film shell element in a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the machined parts ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil paintings . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil paintings . natural pictures and styles live well for this effect .
there are two controllers around that effect on effect . the upper elec@@ ts the p@@ inch size between one and five . thick@@ er brushes are better suited for large pictures . smooth gli@@ des or , from the other side considered , the scar@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the be@@ ast is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels wide picture is 1 and Gl@@ Deposit 17 .
the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity in the drawing . it is helpful if you imagine what scene could have chosen for you to sk@@ ate it . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two regulator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper arm sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom adjust the contrast ( g@@ riff@@ s ) .
this is an example of the carbon filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity .
the pl@@ dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter engraving im@@ presses your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was shown in the wax . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the dig@@ ic@@ am ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ y landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the machined image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a work of po@@ uring effects . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells and makes it look like it is considered by g@@ lass@@ blo@@ o@@ ks .
wave blocks 2 : Analog to wave blocks 1 , the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with button end .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo using imm@@ oral effects . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom in@@ fer@@ mentation : spo@@ res the image along with glob@@ ular lines that im@@ bal@@ es out of a centre . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ om@@ y camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sport photography .
radi@@ cal in@@ jec@@ tions : explo@@ res the image by rotation of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ fer@@ mentation of a turned camera .
distances : dil@@ uted the image to generate a non @-@ focused camera lenses . the object seems to come back in the background .
movement essential : spo@@ ints the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ fer@@ mentation of a linear moving , z : b : a car or by train photograph@@ ing , camera .
us@@ ci@@ ous un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : spo@@ ils the image soft in the dark and strongly in bright tones . this creates images with a dre@@ aming and shiny focus effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portra@@ its , gl@@ amour photos or a ste@@ aming hot and sub@@ tle .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ un@@ sch@@ är@@ fe : destro@@ ys the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the in@@ fer@@ mentation of a arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
Intelligent Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : find the paint blocks in the image and pic@@ ks it out without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : it shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel score .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . this calcul@@ ates the calculation at any time with the button .
the reg@@ ent@@ rop is a nice little tool to make shelves on your image . this gives the natural your images a great look . it uses a protected algorith@@ m by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorith@@ m .
dri@@ p size allows to alter the size of drops . because the dri@@ p size doesn &apos;t necessarily reflect the size of small images , it changes the amount and the density of the drop . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops in the image .
you can stop using the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing a range free from reg@@ ent@@ rop . use the range of tools to select the area , e.g. a face , which will remain free if you want to drop off the filter drop off from reg@@ ent@@ rop .
this is an example of the Reg@@ urg@@ ent Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a silent sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset over a storm . the default values used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning to the right orientation . with the menu you &apos;ll find trans@@ formers or trans@@ formers .
photo Infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enhance a photo image for minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to zoom out is easy . the big question is , how can you find a picture b@@ list@@ ers and more details ? how can you find a picture of a picture ? how can you find the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see a good work here . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale in the desired size with the tool size . select trans@@ form@@ ations in the menu and specify the destination values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge A picture . &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; uses a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorith@@ m photo im@@ pet@@ us was developed by the IMAGE Team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the riders new size and are listed below :
maintain a aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the size of the new size is kept in the original image of the original image .
regul@@ ar@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns greater structures . the more this value is required , the more becomes more complex if it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons can store and store exactly . each one can be saved as a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo infl@@ ating is very quick at what it makes it happen , but it can take a long time and a high CPU load after yourself . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see an example of the infl@@ amed image by using a small colour picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of the linear standard magn@@ ification compared to comparison .
the tri@@ mming of a photos is not only a common surgical procedure , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool for a picture . the image processing allows you to create a picture with mouse , by pressing the mouse and draw up the rec@@ t@@ angle . then you will see this rec@@ t@@ angle when you move your mouse .
once you get rid of the mouse , the area of the photos is cut off . this allows you to change a good overview as your photo after the tri@@ mming board . you can create a new rec@@ t@@ angle by tigh@@ ten up to the corners of the square by clicking it with the left mouse button .
once you are happy with the cutting button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( Ctrl ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save to File menu , to store the newly tri@@ mm@@ ed photo .
in the swing area you can change the size of the angle by sliding the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog box .
in the Tools Fol@@ lowing the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high format or horizontal format . in the high format , the larger value of height and in horizontal format of width is assigned .
the tool I use a ratio of aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same whether you can see inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons are currently using ver@@ tically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
in the dialog box , you can set up with the Max . relationship button to the range of tri@@ mming on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool can be cut down on aspect ratio , depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) , if you are stored as default values in depend@@ ence on orientation . the modified picture measurements are shown in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data is reflected in the tri@@ mm@@ ed picture and not the original image .
the settings of the inter@@ ference help allow help to inv@@ ent us to make your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ ar@@ ity . like the third re@@ ins , harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles are possible to share a rec@@ t@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles at the diagonal .
Golden centre : the golden center is a division of the various natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blo@@ wers leaves of a sun@@ flower . it dives all possible things to feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to con@@ struct your tem@@ ples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos using your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is from the Fibonacci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; ab , where every number after 1 is the sum of their two advanced numbers . the resulting di@@ version is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that is usually follows as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center provides liquid relie@@ ving lines when you put together a picture . these help will be listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring your goal good results for your photos . compared with the third @-@ re@@ gel the golden spir@@ als creates the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the sight of the viewer along the line of spir@@ als and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the square of golden spir@@ als , also called gold rec@@ tang@@ les . it should be enough to direct the eye to the composition of composition . it can be a line that can be a line , or different objects . this something can be done without the eye , it will ful@@ fill its task .
the Golden Triangle also from the above @-@ mentioned golden spir@@ als . NOTE that in contrast to harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equivalent tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can be placed along with a static object .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame , you will try to pl@@ az@@ ate a effect of professional photograph@@ ers dynamic symmetry . the result is a very attractive composition which you can &apos;t reach .
the options horizontal and vertical mir@@ rors are used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can put the color of the au@@ xiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any corner .
if you make a photo then it &apos;s easy to fix the camera , not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture where things can fix at an angle . you can select this with the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation and adjust the target angles .
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can put the slide back to 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown above .
for your help , the module free rotation and a vertical line available . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to fix it with a pressure on the left mouse . right now , you can adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you shot an image you will find un@@ wanted three @-@ dirty holes in the corners . one way to repair it is the function trans@@ form@@ ations from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the auto cut . choose one of the following options :
option anti @-@ al@@ i@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . NOTE the above warning .
all per@@ spek@@ tive trans@@ form@@ ations are performed to a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which can help you change the perspective :
new widths : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are caused by the transformation , are in pixels .
new heights : the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are caused by the transformation , are in pixels .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees on the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjustment of a perspective , the image is slightly poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adap@@ tions produce an twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you &apos;ll get un@@ happy three @-@ dirty holes on the corners . a possibility to un@@ ite it is to cutting off the image with trans@@ formers from the image processing .
the mold is used to post@@ p@@ one a part of the picture in one direction and move the upper part in the picture . this is no rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle will be converted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via trans@@ formers .
she@@ ar your image by using the horiz@@ ontal@@ y angle and vertical angle . if you can press horizontal and ver@@ tically down the angle if you are displayed on zero . a preview of the effectiveness are shown and the new dimensions of the target table are shown on the right .
with your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , like e.g. the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the template tool to adjust your image .
after making the she@@ ar carried out , the picture will be a bit spo@@ iled . for a single she@@ ar this effect is neg@@ lig@@ ible , but two s@@ ings er@@ up@@ ward twice as much me@@ ag@@ ment and so you should avoid this .
after the she@@ ar the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to elim@@ inate it is to cut the image with trans@@ formers from the image processing .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images of your system and , in some cases , from the type such libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ bu@@ tions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ;
because of this depend@@ ence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they are always supported by JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; features only files in formats to the know . this is shown using the file extension and a comparison of this with a defined list . you can change this list of file processing the &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; in the section configuration you can find further information here .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you even to select the format . you can find a more detailed description of these file formats you can find in the Wikipedia . &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; supports both formats .
im@@ compression is the application of data compression method based on digital images . the redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , low results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also be loss without loss if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format , you can read from Wikipedia , The Lumin@@ ous landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions of English . you can find raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw screen@@ shots of &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; .
&amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; and her@@ e@@ by are supported by Dave Coff@@ in below . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; supported by :
many digital cameras supporting the recording short films . this clips are frequently stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format ; but if you are using no film processor ; but if you are not able to play movies and play a film file ; the &amp; k@@ de ; select settings for playing movies in order to start playing the program .
go forward to the previously visited album in the Chronicle . you can only go forward when you go back in advance .

all configured cameras will be added here . you can add the camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please visit the camera to add further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module has exported a range of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
if you sw@@ ap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four Just@@ ations with the module white .
many tools you need the photo@@ processing are in &amp; dig@@ ic@@ am ; include your description here .
all image processing tools like shar@@ pen@@ ing , sof@@ tening , Noise suppression , de@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ k@@ ware , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog module before the filter can be applied on the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; tex@@ ture . &amp; quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the present image . on the left of him , five buttons are allowing the comparison mode of the display . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without duplic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the range right of the selected area .
horizontal divide without duplic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower indicates the filter below the range below the selected area .
ver@@ tically split . the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section indicates the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the front and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general site page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can see this frame with the mouse within the picture and click on the picture of the picture you want to see the preview of the dialog , and the preview of the dialog is now updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to use all buttons on your default values . all adjust@@ ing of the last use of the module is noted .
the side bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely declared . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are written by the EX@@ IF data if these are available .
this rider helps with an intuitive card tool based on the Marble . push it inside or push it out . move it to the left mouse button . move it to the left mouse button . move it to the left mouse button . move it inside this coordinates and displayed . this sets course of course with the Geo @-@ Data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and choose to select colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either apply to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog p@@ allet , you can select from a list of selected pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the c@@ ursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it displays the color to it . colour is described under the p@@ allet placement . also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . in order to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor . then move the mouse at pressed left mouse .
if the c@@ ursor field is added in the c@@ ursor under the button color , color is inserted in the color plate on the c@@ ursor . the color is inserted into either inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ writing . this mode you can adjust the c@@ ursor down under the c@@ ursor .
a selection , which produces as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions , cut out and paste .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end character , if there are three payment values in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
the colors in a p@@ allet and the edition of the colour cho@@ ices can be drawn with the mouse .
a color somewhere on the screen and then select it in color choice on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for looking from &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ graphs are used in science , especially in science , especially in science , particularly in the computer science . so far , there was no modern and GUI ; it includes , according to view of the program author &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; -@@ project has set a goal to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly , with all features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; topo@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; displays graphs with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph in &amp; Kate ; the graph is calculated ane@@ w and viewer ; it is a graph )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphic ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and one h@@ ack to show more than these knots )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph is required . requires detail :
the main window indicates the opened graph , each in its own window . at first , when you start &amp; k@@ graphic viewer . in this case the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file open and the ( empty ) list Last updated files . click on the first icon to view the dialog .
after you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a solid position from this list or select this position automatically .
use the Maus@@ oleum ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
this zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently works in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; loaded file from another program is shown , the following window will be displayed :
you can select whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ign@@ ore the change , if you want to change the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can modify the menu item settings ; see also , see also .
if you open a graphic file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; -@@ Inst@@ ance open , &amp; eg ; in the file level or the command line , you want to open or want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic icon ; inst@@ ances if you want to open or present the graph in a sub@@ windows of the already running inst@@ ances .
as with the last option you can save your choice and modify them subsequently with the setup dialog .
when you start the program you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify what the graph should be split over several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be freely elected .
if you are using several sites , you can select whether the parts of the graph will be missed on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be obtained from the relevant parts of the graph .
with one graph shown on several pages , graphs without head@@ line and with another font
the page again provides the possibility to specify the behavior , if a file has changed on the hard disk , eg . by another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ign@@ ore any changes ) or the program every time .
the Open button provides the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; if a graph is opened outside a current session ( the graph will be opening in a new window or specify in a window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the page seat adjustment is the possibility to specify the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer . you can define a default behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if any starting at any start .
the context menu , which usually appears in a main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n window ; opens further options :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ ou@@ tal@@ es . the entries , as they are written on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geograph@@ ical local@@ ization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image to add and edit . the geograph@@ ic data will be displayed in an external browser in the EX@@ IF data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is based on geograph@@ ical local@@ ization tools to loc@@ ate pictures geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . altitude , sustain@@ ed and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ rel@@ ate your pictures with geograph@@ ic data you need a GPS track than XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device and convert .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical local@@ ization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ rel@@ ate in the main window and call the menu . in order to load a possible cor@@ relation between time and local@@ ization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . this file contains the same time as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded into an automatic cor@@ relation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera time should be carried out on the GMT . this can be done with time zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation is a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . is the devi@@ ation , including the maximum value for this period is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a site , edit the g@@ px file manually and add to the images . the difference difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ rel@@ ate all the images in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used when you &apos;re not using a matching data . if you know that in reality an local@@ ity between camera and GPS is able to insert these bound@@ aries here and then cor@@ rel@@ ate the button cor@@ rel@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next notice , you only need to use the button OK to insert the data at the current photo .
the local@@ ization can also be found with the displayed map and gradually . select this in the respective region and expand this . height must always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually , and the card can be changed between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script used to add a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module may be able to export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums the HTML pages to be exported and the parameter for the HTML pages . the character set will be en@@ coded as UTF @-@ 8 encoding .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the rider is allowed to select all albums . you will need to select this albums . you will need to select this albums on the right hand . you will need to select a great number of albums . in the area , you will quickly find a great number of albums . in the area you will find the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ schau and the lyrics displayed in the head of the HTML page .
the appearance is defined as the general appearance and layout for each side . this rider can also create a page on each picture . if you click on a picture a new page is displayed in the image . otherwise , the picture will be shown directly with your standard picture viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed .
the rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your own pictures . choose a folder with the name KI@@ PI@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information will be saved in the new images too .
with other colour depth , you can change the standard color depth and obviously the file size . all other settings are declared themselves .
the Rider th@@ umb@@ nails allows you to watch some of the album &apos;s slide for the th@@ umb@@ nails ; these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user like far the action . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has created the page , the window doesn &apos;t work automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to indicate whether errors during the generation . the web browser will automatically start to close the preview of the gallery .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to check out a selection of images and perform on them basic surgery such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shif@@ ts . the viewer can be used with short instructions and quick access to its functions .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
the m@@ peg co@@ di@@ ers module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG @-@ Video , with a defined length , which allows packages of m@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic image file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are scal@@ ed automatically on the correct video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide . with this module , it is possible to create a background color for the DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you will need to select images that are packed into MPEG slides . after that , you can create the module via Apple MPEG slides .
the images selected by you are then listed below image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should adapt the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD , you must select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds which is displayed a picture . the speed of the image is defined below . a low value creates a very sud@@ den , a high contrast .
the background color can be set aside . in doubt , you should put it black . in doubt , you should define the name and path of the desired file under the name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can go to the generation of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer , you can drink a coffee and enjoy the slides , if you are back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths of the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right button below .
the printer wiz@@ ard allows you to print several images on one sheet paper together in standard photograph@@ ers . this is also automatically wi@@ red with the picture processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or im@@ print with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or import your images stored in RAW format from three formats JPEG , TIFF or PP@@ M .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . there is a look at d@@ cra@@ w , that it may produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RAW file which should be converted and launch the module . the Raw @-@ Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . you can preview the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adapt the values to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the basic parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later .
a four @-@ color RG@@ BA conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera is in RGB mode , the RG@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and the filen@@ ame remains the default and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss car@@ ved algorith@@ m and produced the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , TIFF , main@@ tains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W comp@@ ressing .
if you prefer to process your images or later , you should not use the JPEG format , because it is only allowed to have a limited number of operations before the image quality is deter@@ ior@@ ated . TIFF and PP@@ M are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata files in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process so you can use ab@@ rupt@@ ing .
the fork processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode when you &apos;re sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file . however , it is helpful if this progress is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the image convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can pre@@ fix the pre@@ fix and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to alter the size of several images of a image collection . you can use the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can use the image smaller or enlarge . in addition , four kinds of image changes are provided :
propor@@ tional ( 1 d@@ in . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the picture will be automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust the screen size .
dis@@ propor@@ tional : not propor@@ tional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparations : prepar@@ es the image for photo pressure . the user can adjust the screen resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures before . additional images can be moved to the list of sending images and place there .
after you started the module , the image window will be shown to select the images provided by you . you can add another images with a file selected dialog . a preview on the right side will be shown .
you can also drag images to the picture list and add it to the list of sending images this way .
with the button images , the selected pictures are removed from the list of sending images .
after you have selected all pictures you have selected the button OK to open the new message box of your e @-@ mail clients . you have to add just the addresses and the subject . you have already attached you as an app@@ endix .
please pay attention to many images to once again . most e @-@ mail accounts have restri@@ ctions on the size of sent e @-@ mails . it is probably a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used each time until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients choose from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ mail agent on your machine before . you can download it here .
after selecting the comments in a file the comments will add the comments to the images in a text file and join the mail .
the PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in images file format and select the original files in JPEG format , the original Ex@@ if@@ details will be added to send pictures .
if the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down , so you can watch the status feedback , if your e @-@ mail programme will be started automatically at the end . with button closure , you can close this window ? EN .
after starting the module advanced , the slide shows a window with questions about how you want to see your slide show . you can select between the selected and selected pictures of the album .
the OpenGL trans@@ itions in the presentation is enabled very elegant pictures from OpenGL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show is very slow .
the file name filen@@ ames ensures that the filen@@ ame of images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop provides that the presentation will be displayed in a pin loop . then you can break it manually with Es@@ c .
the option does acc@@ ident@@ ally make sure the pictures will be displayed in a random order . thus , it is not used as the sequence of images in the album .
consider@@ ing the pictures , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effects depend on your friends you should show the presentation your friends !
there are more than a do@@ zen transition effects between them you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses a different effect on any transition between pictures .
during the slide you can access a tool@@ bar at the top @-@ left edge . move the mouse into this corner to view you .
with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slides .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team below k@@ de @-@ Im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ org@@ . respect : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a background image to set a picture for the working area .
this module uses the actual picture , depending on the selected option of the under@@ men@@ h@@ ment , as background for your K@@ DE working space .
once you have provided your pictures and video with notes , you can play with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture by this brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , then in persons , places and in the group keywords are present .
in the browser window , you can see the categories , for which you have posted on your pictures and video with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the file correction of your hard disk and of course view the current screen@@ shots . the following will be described here .
when you press the mouse on the entry level , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images will be shown on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of displayed images from a few thousand images on a few images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view images to view images of your active area .
in the picture , every person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can also save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for every person you can have their own image screen , this also applies to places , j@@ ig@@ s and other categories you have defined . see the image .
to view images aside from the name , select the button , which is right on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can display the view for each category separately , that you can display e.g. symbols with images from people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have appropriate pictures ) .
you must , however , select which image for each individual person is to be displayed . in order to see this image , you need to edit the image file menu ( described in closer ) and select the picture factor for the corresponding Person . in the c@@ ash@@ ts window , you can adapt the picture factor according to your wishes and therefore select which portion of the picture is indicated or stored in the context menu .
if you are looking for searching the entry in the main window , you will find a dialogue in which dialogue for creating the image features is very similar . this dialogue you can see on the picture again .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ elling or description , the labels or descriptions of the pictures will be searched for this text . if you wish , you can also use a date if you wish to search for a part of the total data , i.e. , for example , in 1971 , or the entire date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures in the bottom of the window , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Helene are shown .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like reading books , rather than want to try different functions , you have the following altern@@ atives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the first dialog box , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; - Demo will be downloaded - a few example images are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main center of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . here . as the name suggest@@ s , this strip gives you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the time bar can display several different time units . each strip gives you another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by view the strip only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar can be interactive to the following ways : you can select the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the time line will always show you the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button . if you select the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the time line , i.e. the time data is displayed . you can cancel a range when you click on a bar at the time bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML Web pages with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described above the menu to create HTML ... call upon the menu page .
before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three sectors contents , layout and finish . in the following each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the super@@ visor and a description that should contain HTML @-@ file later . on c@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ sample page you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; file will be prepared to see the page page . more information about export files can be found in .
last , you can select which information on the HTML pages will be displayed . this allows you to avoid information on the viewer without a description . please note that all images of a party are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to conce@@ ive certain images from certain Bet@@ rach@@ s .
in this area you can set up how the HTML pages look like . most setting methods are un@@ equ@@ iv@@ oc@@ ally , so it doesn &apos;t have been noted .
below on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who have to consider your website and have a monitor , which have a maximum resolution of 800x600 , or even download photos , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your side can change the resolution at any time the resolution you have to change . it can therefore also search your pictures with low resolution , browse . if he would like to see a picture above , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL where your site will be saved .
best of all , select a base folder for all of your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you must select the main folder where all your images will be stored . this folder will be saved and installed automatically for all future pictures . this allows you to select a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if you have created a URL in the base folder . if you have created a web browser , after the pages you have created here , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if you do not want to copy the HTML files to you yet in the final target file , you need to manually specify the import function . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , it is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder inside that are all sub@@ folder .
the just written adjustment possibilities were included all three on basic folder or URLs . in this case , a sub@@ folder , whose name is laid down in output file .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to have a lot of time for viewing the images , reception location , etc . you will need to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even easier .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ emp@@ lified with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you can only tell it if the images are stored in the file or if you have to use a link in the file , you can have all the images here and so regardless of them . the apparent dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ex@@ port@@ ing ... or together with HTML pages , see , create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file sear@@ ches the images in a two way . first , sear@@ ches are not found in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if you have searched the images you have created in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is naturally only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following phase , dialogue for ex@@ port@@ ing images will be described above the menu file ex@@ port@@ ing ... to call up .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act alone or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three selection options available :
when you select the manually select the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since the most images have been compressed using JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you wish , simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is maximum picture size limit . if you send your favorite pictures you would like to send your pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file otherwise would be very large . here you can say that each image is maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you are using a file with .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Import ... it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database is as described in it .
the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consist of four steps . first you must select which images you would like to import from , after which folder will import pictures .
it can be that you are interested in the category people of the imported file staff ( if you are a d@@ ull ) while this category is called in the third dialog window , which are to be imported as categories of imported file to imported file and to which categories are used in your database .
in the fourth step , you can collect the categories of the imported file using the categories of your current database . one example for this you can see on the image .
it simply must be easy to browse images and look : if you see pictures , you often want to view images from different picture groups and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depic@@ ted .
in this hand@@ book you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) to find information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) for searching and seeing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ t@@ ability .
K@@ photo@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it was expanded and today will also take care of your videos . in many places this manual will take pictures , but often also closes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all his information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the su@@ preme folder of their images . it is a simple XML file that you can ass@@ ure you with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal back and re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice@@ able the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Star@@ ts . if you would like to read another database with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
using the menu entry settings / photo album ; you can set up into a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of user manual you will discuss the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call the settings of preview and options for viewing the viewer . for each setting up an extensive help you can call on the F1 @-@ button and a click on the requested option .
it was described as you can select for each picture of different features , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
view the dialog box which is used to process already existing groups . you can select a symbol and select a symbol for each existing group .
in section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete list of members , e.g. all members of a group at a group instead of all groups of a middle class as explained in .
in view the settings possibilities you are available to determine the list of members . in the left list box , you can select the category that you would like to configure . in the left window of window there is a list with the current category and in the right one of the sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; divi@@ des his module system with other graphics applications , such as dig@@ i@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . more information on the homepage from K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called through the menu modules , and they are not described in this hand@@ book because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have an aid page which you can call over the modules itself .
since the modules of multiple applications will be used together with each other , it can always be used with the demo database ; therefore , you should use the demo database with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ inputs \ &gt; or via the menu . don &apos;t say , I would not have war@@ ned you !
applications that use the modules of K@@ IP@@ I , are very different making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which can also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , so you will be able to use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view , so all the images that shows you the picture preview now .
beside the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , e.g. all the persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will have the category that you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , so you can use the photo@@ album ; so if you should have selected persons to view and the module will continue to pass this .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove these from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are familiar from any other K@@ DE application , you can look at the top of an menu and a tool bar . at the moment , you can see the window in which you can see your picture database . in the section we &apos;ll see you on this window , but now click on the photos show that shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to see every picture with ob@@ serv@@ ations . this includes information about the people shown on the picture , where the picture is taken either individually or for a larger number of images added at the same time . if , for example , all images are shown by Jes@@ per and all images in Copenhagen have been added .
all these remarks may be used for searching and brow@@ s@@ ers as you can see in the section . if you want to see this comment , if you want to see the built @-@ in viewer .
in case you can see three lists using a text box by selecting people , places and j@@ ig@@ s . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always be able to use it if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the moving pictures inside the list : if you are for example a family celebration , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depic@@ ted , you can find that the used names are shif@@ ted up@@ ward , people can quickly find and as@@ sign the persons faster .
if you prefer to get an alph@@ abe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting after date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture , you may like to edit any selected pictures and add those photos with notes . simply click on the buttons and back buttons which are located below the picture &apos;s preview right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and add the menu item Sever@@ al entries to once with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a group . to show you that it is a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to a category or sub@@ category . attention , this ass@@ umes that you can not sort your categories alph@@ abe@@ tically .
you can shift the individual elements of the dialog , by clicking the bar that form the outer edge of the frame , click and move it . you can move it from a frame as well as you pull it out of the window .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , you have to be satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also send a frame also completely . if you would like to get this window later , use the button options ... and here a window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images showing in the browser , you get an overview with images of the currently selected pictures , or all the images if you don &apos;t see any filter . for example , you can see the size of the screen@@ shots , to configure the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
when you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is shown in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new ad window will be created .
you can delete images in the picture preview , and simply delete the corresponding images from the you , and select either the remove button or select the menu button . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use a photo album that you can have stored on your hard drive . in the picture you can take a photo album somewhere . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images from the hard drive can be loaded .
images where the right upper left is cut off , but for example , the images are stored on the hard drive . for example 5 @-@ 9 , however , the screen@@ shots are present , so you can see the preview of these pictures . however , you can &apos;t see these pictures with the picture .
as you see , this function doesn &apos;t require you to copy files from the folders and you would not want to avoid files from the folders . if you want to avoid any wor@@ ms to your pictures , please buy a bigger hard disk in order to save all images .
in the menu Pictures , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you wish to make a little more privacy you wish to remain un@@ accessible in the menu of privacy . alternatively , you can also view all the images that your little sister must be , control and the menu entry everything except the current view .
for this you have set what images will be hidden in case of F@@ all . if you want to insert the images in the case of your little sister , simply click on the images you have to be blocked . if you want to see the images back , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password , which to un@@ lock the images must be entered . to set up the password , simply change password in the menu .
please consider that this kind of image protection is very safe . for example , all images on the hard disk and for others can only be read or delete it on the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml ; this type of password protection is not used for those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to have a look on private pictures .
the reason why you have all your images with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage to describe them and hours over hours you want to describe it . for this reason you have to look at some time . because of this reason you have a picture _ and video viewer . you can see from the preview as described in .
the viewer you can see in . he naturally shows the image , but additional information you have to enter about the image , e.g. who is on the image , when and where it was done , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ Box in the upper part of the picture you can see , so you can also configure the mouse and follow what information is displayed . all these options are displayed on a right click on the viewer . then , the menu text menu can be seen down below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click on this browser , see the search entries to this . if you click on Anne Helene , the browser shows you all pictures from Anne Helene . as if you had selected a person from the browser and then Anne Helene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer you can switch between them and back , by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer you can run this as a slide photo . then you can select a new picture after a few seconds . how frequently it can be done by pressing the Ctrl button and Plus or minus . starting and stopped the slide show from the keys Ctrl ; S .
a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . just use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can use in the image and zoom out in the image . with the mouse , you can use a rec@@ t@@ angle . with the mouse button , you can zoom in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ om@@ ed . with the balance of the zoom , the zoom on the screen corresponds to an image of the image .
NOTE that the only Zo@@ om@@ operations can work with videos that are both in and out with Plus@@ - and Min@@ ut@@ aste .
with the background features from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make a comment on the image gallery ob@@ serv@@ ations from the context menu .
if you can see pictures , that you will find a picture with a person whose name will have you forgotten on the image . in the moment you can see the view and configure the configuration dialog of the picture to mark this name . you will probably submit only the picture to select and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see what pictures you want to see on paper . to see what photos you want to start with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you watch one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer will give you the opportunity to view images with features , while you see them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the respective letters . in case you see a picture where the features of A , B and C are set .
once you have set characteristics on your pictures , you can see them in your browser . if you have selected all the images you need , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want .
categories and special features can be displayed in front view . if you can view the categories in D@@ re front view , then you can simply add the characters for the feature when the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case you can paint &amp; photo album on the picture .
the painted value is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your own mixture later .
in an image you can see a painting on the painted text box . on the painting you can draw on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting menu , simply select the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully rule , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties below and the object in the wi@@ re@@ - displays yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object as all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select menu entry in the menu .
if possible positions , the following menu will be inserted , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the context menu from the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have properties , click on to apply these changes . if you have entered in@@ valid values , a message will be displayed with a error listing . then , you can rec@@ tif@@ y the input files and re@@ ject the changes with Canc@@ el .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution program you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 provides already the user documentation .
in case you edit a tex@@ ture or a part of tex@@ ture , you can see a preview of the property view .
press a preview in the at@@ tribute painting and a little example of the scene is structured by the chosen text , even if you want to render an arran@@ ging element ( for example a tex@@ ture in a tex@@ ture map and not the whole tex@@ ture map ) , you cross locally .
the screenshot showing the camera control points . you can draw these control points with the mouse , thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it becomes displayed a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the center for scal@@ ing and rotation and the position for shif@@ ts . you can change the shift by pul@@ ling with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a visual acu@@ ity . you can specify this value relative to visible vis@@ ibility of the parent object or as absolute value . Objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their vis@@ ibility level smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the property properties are left and the four graphical displays on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard shut@@ down or if you need any other arrangement you can also store several windows arran@@ gements and easily switch between different orders .
to view a window over or under one existing view , drag the beginner to the upper or bottom edge of a view . rec@@ t@@ angle will then show the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view .
if you would like to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views on the map plates above on the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the top left at the top of the above arrow in the beginn@@ ings .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the k@@ asser@@ bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can be an@@ cho@@ red at any point .
the current window view can save a window on window ... save . it will display a dialog box where you can save the windows of windows under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g to ren@@ dering this program was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 at present . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering The symbol ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . he determin@@ es the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you wish to insert a scene in different formats and quality levels , you can supply many r@@ ender modes , from a fast preview up to Full @-@ quality images .
when you click on the symbol The R@@ ender Settings in the tool@@ bar or select in menu View modes ... select the following dialog is opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can input any name , but it is useful to recogn@@ ise the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to use only a small area of the image , select the cross @-@ section and enter the image cut to the fields in the input fields .
drop down in combination quality you can select the properties that are used by a very simple colour and light model . this goes by a very simple color and light model with complex @-@ diff@@ use refle@@ ction lighting . you will find a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties available in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is generated with only one ray per pixel . these images are often displayed in curves and lines , sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is al@@ i@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses an technique called anti @-@ al@@ i@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this property is better .
when you switch off Anti @-@ Ali@@ ase , calcul@@ ating &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . the standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling is revers@@ ed ; recur@@ sively recur@@ sively , because every pixel is split again and adap@@ tively it depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray plays a beam according to the set @-@ value pixels with super sampling . if you need a grid value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , if you have a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 radi@@ als per pixel . if the difference between the color values exce@@ eds the specified threshold , the pixels is split into 4 sub @-@ pixel size , which can be individually tested and adjusted to further under@@ lines . the maximum depth of the re@@ winding can be adjusted with the depth value .
another option to reduce the al@@ asing effect is that the creation of h@@ iss for the ray process , called j@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn on J@@ itter@@ ing , the rays vary around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use refle@@ ction . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it is very long to calculate the diff@@ use light refle@@ ction . it takes a very long way to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels is calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated R@@ ays has no object .
opens a new window for playing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene file , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently it supports &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; not the complete set of set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , an dialog window displays list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you can import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to export the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . in order to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and drag it into the objects .
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can include source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is the P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
when you click on the Help menu , opens &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . place here the path to your document and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( for example height fields ) in the paths to the P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files in the folder , you need to insert the path to these files here . if a file is found in different ways of the library , the first file is used .
the color of the wire models . the second color will be used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for display of selected control points .
the color of the angle checks for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type designation .
you can set the pitch of points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire Model Views . you can set the pitch separately for shif@@ ts , scal@@ ing , and turns .
greater values yiel@@ ded a more precise wire model and therefore a better seal for the displayed exhibits , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detailed element for two directions .
if you cross the high Detailed tre@@ ble for extended projec@@ tions , all wi@@ re@@ tions are used . advanced projec@@ tions are used . advanced projec@@ tions with excep@@ tions of a perspective and ver@@ tically projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to the projec@@ tions but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is sli@@ pped . the wall is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross soil , a floor is sli@@ pped below the objects . the ground is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you are en@@ abling cant@@ il@@ is@@ sions , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ al@@ i@@ asing @-@ method used for the ren@@ dering of scenes . parameters for depth and sw@@ elling you can set . precise informations you can find in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page , you can change existing windows arran@@ gements or create new window orders . in the Section window orders , it explains how you can create and save window orders .
drop down standard window order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used the chosen window order in the program start .
the list Add existing window arran@@ gements shows all existing windows of windows . a new arrangement may be added with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and no blank may be empty .
list below are all views on the chosen window order . new views can be added with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
the new window on the window of the new window . create a new column on the right hand side of the existing window , with the original window , you get a map viewer in common with the above view and floating in the main window , but generates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to follow any more precise knowledge of both programs . if you &apos;re able to set the ultimate but simple scene , the ultimate but simple scene is very popular : a bul@@ let on one layer .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you decide to use just a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for the ren@@ dering will be applied as a result .
if you don &apos;t include lighting sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only receive a black image .
if you have anything wrong , you see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ set window order :
take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the Tool@@ bar . please read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
these menus and symbols are to be used frequently , so you should remember menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object too . select the scene and select the menu entry Edit . thus , you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model @-@ view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you produce . in particular , it is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows the result of the scene in the scene .
the slide tree is now a new entry with the name of the camera . when it click on it , you can find the contents of the view , where the various parameters of the camera will find . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
do not change anything about the basic settings of camera , this is later that you can change the camera in the view control point , with which you can change the camera in the camera . simply click on the left button on a Control Point , and drag him to the desired place .
if you press the button or press the input button , the wire model views and the object tree can be adjusted instantly with these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could set for example a f@@ ader ( inser@@ tion body qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complete method for resol@@ ving this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; is actually a sim@@ pler way . you can use an infin@@ ite level as a floor :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model @-@ view now displays the level , even if at the moment only as a limited level . if you render the scene , the level extends up to the horiz@@ on .
if you watch the object too , you &apos;ll find that you can see the entry for the bottom fold . in this case you will only see the different parameters for each new object : scal@@ ing , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizontal axis , so you can get to know some of these parameters . choose the values as follows :
just pick up the floor to introduce its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something flat at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog is where you can select as the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the property table . you can see the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button Preview you see , as pig@@ ment now looks .
of course the preview of pig@@ ments only need a matt black material , because you need to check your material yet with a click on preview . also , you can always try to check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many options , but take the sim@@ pl@@ est one now .
if you do not see a color on qu@@ ader or bul@@ let , just click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is right now . if you render your image now with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course this is not the colour that you have expected . here , you need to enter two new at@@ tributes . in the color list , you will need to do two new at@@ tributes . then , select this entry twice ( you can also do so frequently , but the board game list can only be used with two colours ) :
in the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal kind and change the colors in the view of the property properties :
you should already simply run this step as you should already have the basic working method of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ et@@ eler ; it is as easy as the ball can be created just like the ground :
in the bottom of the property properties you can change the value for the radius : on 1 ( please do not forget the input button or the button to apply ) , so the ball is suspended over the bottom . otherwise , the ball would float to the floor for a unit .
of course the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as previously to see , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put it in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can now prove your material now . as with the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pigment , select then used and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take time to introduce some finish features :
then change the values like in the following image maps and click on using or press En@@ ter .
the settings of gloss effect and refle@@ ction result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal is not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of that which offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have learned a lot that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is an ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional scene of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ vis@@ es a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , ren@@ eg@@ ame the ren@@ eg@@ ot@@ oth@@ ic rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflect the scenes ) as this beam is reflected in the scene and as atmosph@@ er@@ ic effects , such as fog effect . thus the scene is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , the camera will see without a camera , the camera is yours eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see anything , the picture is just black . obviously needs each scene , which should be ri@@ pen@@ ed , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files are usually the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
wh@@ en@@ ever you open a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space .
sets the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last memory .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you haven &apos;t stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog box , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or to write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ it@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for the change of keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add a new commands to this option , def@@ aul@@ ts to &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
opens a dialog for the device of tools . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; add the commands and execute commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to measure rough surfaces , without any ow@@ l on the surface , and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a tex@@ ture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : highly complex 3D models are produced by do@@ zens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a realistic appearance .
a tex@@ ture map is a way to specify the surface of an object color to pixel base , by using a picture file as a color chart .
Fun@@ c@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and web browser . the application features a file center where you can select images to the display .
pictures can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ cker ; is very simple . the file row@@ aves lists files on which you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return user .
you can adjust whether any picture will appear in a own window , or if all images should always be the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the filen@@ ame in the browser window . then , a small input field is found in the right lower corner . if a matching filen@@ ame is found , the input field is caused by pressing the Return of Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue In@@ set - &amp; ku@@ cker show ; there are five cards of card . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the work@@ ings of &amp; ku@@ cker . in the two other , short commands for the display , the key@@ hole can be set for the respective windows .
if the image is selected in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color which you can continue down . default is no full screen mode .
if this point is activ@@ ating &amp; ku@@ cker show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you see the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ cker show ; when opening the last open folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ cker show ; this folder opens in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . it is used in the screen to fill the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , also the background is filled with selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ cker show ; so setup that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also represent the program .
with this option , it is enlarged to screen the display grid on the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
specify when the sli@@ deshow should start with the first picture in the folder or the selected image .
the period between screen change in sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , this value is set to 0 , if it is collap@@ sed by the user , you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here the key@@ note for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ cker show ; in the flash@@ cards do short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser .
with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the files@@ ystem ( a window for sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .

&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a application to sc@@ anned images that do not make more than pictures to scan and to en@@ rich .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to sc@@ anned images that do not make more than pictures to scan and save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images from the store .
you can review the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal can be opened , if no standard scanner is set , then a dialog is opened to the selection of the scanner .
the user can select the required scanner and press OK to open the scanner . drain and exit the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options .
to can@@ enter a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ spin and then scan the scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be launched by the preview button .
to select the picture better , the user can also zoom in the image and choose out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview can fit in the window .
when the picture was selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings , then the image is shown in a show@@ case , displayed . when saving is pressed , then the image is stored and narrow ? en leads to a break@@ through and you get back into the main window .
through the button settings , the same named dialog is opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can see the image if desired , in front of the Save . in this case , the option must not be selected before saving a preview , then the user must not be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type and sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images saves dialog . dialog for each image open the dialog in front of each one @-@ named image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite will open the dialog automatically , then you need to ask Save without a file name .
this setting defines where the images can be saved without a file name without any file name . then , when the images are stored for each scan , then this folder is used as a default for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically save the images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog box . the automatically stored picture gets an numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the figures .
the user can custom@@ ize the image quality to store image quality . if you select the picture quality is not selected , the default value of Q@@ t is used .

you may need to set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Do you make your keyboard to Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE @-@ programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context brow@@ ning browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function rec@@ ess could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok still has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback , if the script will not be executed if all the required modules are present and use none dialog , so that the user will not see why a script does not run .

in the folder of scripts / Tem@@ plates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can quickly find it as a base for your own scripts . you will quickly find that writing is relatively simple .
with D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the eas@@ iest way is to use the command file d@@ co@@ p , which should accompany any K@@ DE installation .
most script@@ ing languages enable the execute of external programs and commands . this is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simple . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send messages to all running scripts . for this reason strings are to monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script will also ign@@ ore the events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to indicate the setup dialog . to store the configuration dialog itself , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok imple@@ ments the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change visu@@ alis@@ es that a new piece is played . the script could now call and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions may inqu@@ ire further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the tiles length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ posted a change of lou@@ dness . the new volume is an inte@@ ger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title : contains the path to the selected files of playlist . in order to add an own entry , you can use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu in s@@ ong@@ Title ) .
before and Amar@@ ok ; it stopped , or if the user stops a script , sends a script called SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed so for example , it should be processed for example , to store data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded by a web server . such packages are normally used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .b@@ z@@ 2 ) , that the user can also recogn@@ ise the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 are only allowed to accept script packages with the Advanced amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame automatically your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script &apos;s package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surpris@@ ingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily pull music into the playlist , instead of endless menus . you may also search for a quite certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it will be found in seconds to collect the piece within seconds .
maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never choose which you want to hear ? then , the playlist is still difficult for you . and if the decision is still heavily damaged , select the correct mode and intelligent play@@ lists automatically according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used as you can listen to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right to experience your music !
usually you need to enter and install Amar@@ ok on the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has as most applications running some options to enable or dis@@ able the configure point with the configure program . this is a list of available options .
certain depend@@ encies must be met for some of the comp@@ iling options , so they can be used in section system requirements .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug symbols . you have the choice of yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; without any effort using the setup dialog , the setup dialog has several maps to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the player window switches the player window , in addition to the playlist , if the option is switched off , only the playlist window is specified ( Ju@@ K ) .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only requires the k@@ ib@@ ib@@ s package and otherwise no further K@@ DE pack@@ ets . you need to have k@@ del@@ ib@@ s so far ( including the programs included ; for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; we need some of them to minim@@ ise e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small manual on how to comp@@ ile k@@ del@@ ib@@ s minimal .
some functions like the O@@ SD are pres@@ ently re@@ tained that your window manager will continue to support the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . we try to run Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ del@@ ib@@ s and Q@@ t , for these make an excellent development environment .
probably , you can see one of your files in the Tag@@ li@@ b library to days . you can see the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / AT _ scan@@ .@@ log . please also report the broken file on which the crash has caused . then you can delete the file and create the file again .
especially , it is because the lib when reading the met@@ a info from that file . please report the errors to the Tag@@ li@@ b @-@ Develop@@ er under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then leads to crash when editing the met@@ a info .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then turn off . off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ stroke by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically by a crash when it is a frequently occurr@@ ing crash , the error will be fixed .
this makes it possible to write many program files as UTF @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a info , but not the following Perl script fixes over the problem .

no . Yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; therefore the actual question no@@ d Which media types is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ins / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we can support such a imag@@ in@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you are using Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied in the default value any MP3 decoder . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
take the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option &apos; Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . this can be done through a sound card using hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in search of problems and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to indicate a different S@@ ink ( e.g. flat sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can only read one white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer writes the file , de@@ code it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , exactly as x@@ ins .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the sound server using the highest priority ( real @-@ time performance ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ rap@@ pers are set :

either you do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ins , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized strongly for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound and multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer . Yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all the components . run G@@ ST regist@@ ers to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Store out am@@ ni@@ peg files ( you will then find G@@ ST regist@@ ers ) once more than your regular user . delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config ( g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST regist@@ ers again . start now and run G@@ ST regist@@ ers . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .

this quick start guide will show you how to copy the steps with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you will have to copy a data CD into just four steps . to complete the steps , you need to have a te@@ qu@@ est installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and have set the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a machine @-@ CD , please select Extras , CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the button Start . you now see a dialog of the button so it looks like that :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of copying process . once the read of the original file is taken into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD @-@ media to which the data should be burned .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; it bur@@ ns the image file . you have to wait until the overall progress reaches 100 % .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; it bur@@ ns the image file . you have to wait until the overall progress reaches 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool UI@@ C can &apos;t find &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules cannot be found . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org . you can also get the latest version of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . you can also get feedback from the for@@ ums and news .
if you are using &amp; K@@ 3@@ b you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program runs audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the internet such programs are generally called R@@ ipper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , patented and professional technology for audio encoding and for handling with audio data stre@@ ams . OGG Vor@@ bis is from open source to MP3 . this library is used by Og@@ g Vor@@ bis De@@ ko@@ der@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio @-@ layers layers I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported by the MP3 decoder module .
LA@@ ME : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in the quality and speed with commercial encoder . LA@@ ME is used from the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ sy @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C decoder Module and the external Audio encoder module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ ret@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing of different audio formats . it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files , for example to switch to an audio CD into burning .@@ de@@ co
SO@@ x : a utility that can convert between different audio formats and can be used . SO@@ x is used by SO@@ x Audio Encoder Module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for the video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a well @-@ equipped authority system to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
Reg@@ ize : this tool will be useful to adjust@@ ing the volume of music files onto a standard level . for example , the different recording level of different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect , which can be played differ@@ ently according to music .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : here it is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD , and automatically add all the videos to the CD folder .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project is stored already once , the previously created file is over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked after a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save will be displayed , with which you select file and filen@@ ame for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would go to Save for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project is changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what it should be done . you can then cancel the closing as well and the project can also be opened .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will be asked for each of the saved project what should happen , just as if you had called for each project file .
includes all open projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each of the supplied project is asked what should happen , as if you had called up a file .
if you call this entry , you can select the released dialog , select the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the Project view . if the current project is an data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens dialogue &quot; Fir@@ ing for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the dialog box dialog . the only difference is for burning the media . you can only open the burning dialog only if the project has already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different settings , most of which are described ? -@@ help ( re@@ achable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . he causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b files to import files into the current project , even if you &apos;re not using files for a previously session , even if this function is not used , so that you can already see the files on the files and folders .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes no files from the current project . all other files are re@@ tained in the project . this function remo@@ ves files from medium , but leaves only the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows copying one CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD . alternatively , you may also use cl@@ oning if you wish to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . it also allows copying one DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a DVD with the help of copy . it also has to be able to record the target medium enough to record the whole ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for the Form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which makes the content completely er@@ ased . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you the choice between writing modes and incre@@ mental .
bur@@ ns a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog is inter@@ viewed for an * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need other tools like e.g. N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog is inter@@ viewed for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can be burnt immediately through pressing the burning button .
a previously released DVD @-@ Video can be converted . however , this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used as a single file . it also includes information about the read out of the size and even cut black edges .
displays information about the pic@@ kled media . this information is shown in the content and include the properties of the media , such as size and title @-@ length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . when this is not shown , the status bar is blin@@ ded .
turns on a folder view or off . the folder view includes a summary of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , the content is displayed on the content . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media @-@ Info , locking and un@@ locking of the drive or design of the media .
turns on a or off . the table view allows selecting and drag files into the projec@@ tile . the content is also selected to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD folder .
turns the head list in the projec@@ ting view or off . the head fl@@ utes is a narrow range when the projec@@ ting open has open projects . the head list has no real function , looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the other views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part has chosen , you can adjust the key order down below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; allow the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are needed , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
it opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings will be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b should work for a job . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and re@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ Interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to your taste and the type of your task is crucial , what the crucial program you can take advantage .
in this chapter , we supp@@ ose that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then , then give a bit like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have created all &amp; k@@ de ; program measured , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) void cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the Project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface that applies only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void remo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void fl@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String earlier Name ) void set@@ u@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
so it is possible to fill out a script project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders , and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT @-@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can be easily read audio CD ; also read and in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on the hard drive ) and of many co@@ di@@ ers ( un@@ los@@ sy ) . currently , l@@ ame packages must be installed from the Linux di@@ str@@ um . further co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( un@@ fun@@ nier and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats such as the los@@ sy @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; used by &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is put together . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package , if this is not installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , Og@@ g@@ Vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other code@@ c have already been installed , but it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile anything up to yourself . if the code is not needed , the installation is not necessary , the installation is not necessary .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / file format will be used ? the text Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction about co@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and composition factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; it is not possible to cr@@ ack the audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid any copy of the CD ; it is not possible to avoid any copying system . even avoid the mechanisms of head protection . avoid the purchase of copying @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once a suitable setup ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration ) , after a suitable configuration you will be read on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) for understanding for the slim approach of the user interface that will be stum@@ bling at the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which code@@ c programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; take information from Free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without network , where all can be recorded manually .
this is only a quick list of the master &apos;s commands . on the page you find more information such as this program is used as well as screenshot with descriptions of the program tab .
starts the CD@@ DB inquiry of CD data accordingly to the installation of Inqu@@ iry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online in the latter case first , first connection must first be made to the Internet . )
starts to read and - when an encoder included in the tab @-@ tab , the coding settings can be configured in the configuration file .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , allowing the selection with another encoder than the standard can be read out . it is too aware that the encoder settings in the tab dialog is configured in the setup dialog .
the file opens , so that an already selected file is chosen to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
open the setup dialog for the kind of messages ( like protocols , pie@@ p@@ ses ) for programming events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ates ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; with different map types ( like encoder , for setup of the encoder ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter includes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rati@@ os and helps you select the right code .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; mon@@ key &apos; which may not be available for this distribution . the cons are the low compression rati@@ os and barely any commercial devices that can play these files .
amongst the audio formats , we lose information through data compressed depending on their psycho@@ ac@@ oust@@ ical model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG files today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but the differences are less important , as both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distribution channels , but there are open license questions
+ High up to high quality quality ( at high speed rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - When only music belongs to a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - support these devices usually only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and resulting from resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setup gives good transparency to most people and the most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer more transparency to most people and most of the music pieces of acceptable transparency and has already high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . well enough for music from y@@ outh@@ s , portable devices and auto@@ ster@@ e@@ o@@ ids . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you really want to see the absolutely highest quality without consider@@ ation to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which can be inserted into the program or automatically fet@@ ched from the Free@@ DB file via the Internet are available as a list of parameters . you can commit / needed to create and used with &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; and to create the program name and the code name and the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the j@@ ig@@ ures ( in english ) If MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame will be added if MP@@ 3s must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; the result will be added as : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that are needed ( = butt@@ on@@ hole in assist@@ ants ) :
this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can read / enter the information , so that all the other information can be downloaded from on@@ es@@ elf in the computer , so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
Yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. des U@@ e@@ ber@@ aner ) is not att@@ or@@ ney . however , no one can find out the public on the &amp; CD ; however , no one can be found out by the &amp; CD ; any more or less worth@@ less , so it can be obtained from the artist yet by a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual ones .
in &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; it is active to select a check@@ box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it does not seem to use the e @-@ mail address when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator is setup ; the topo@@ graphic will be used to use the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and displays the load between the computers .
a visit to Fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org will provide a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; for information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database can be downloaded .
which mak@@ e@@ up program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save WAV files on my computer ?
there &apos;s rum@@ ours that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used , seeking out in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed first if this is not done .
to store the read WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can and thus select the desired file format . in the first opening you are selected for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution to be used before en@@ co@@ ders . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . further information about co@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter World Co@@ di@@ erer .
following the installation of a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about his switches as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive on it and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio @-@ co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . they might run on both programs with a command line in a terminal .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ in audio CD ; check out the p@@ ouch of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step for example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips how to proceed .
have you read the whole manual , but you &apos;re still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step for example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up the program what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all setup and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 j@@ ig@@ ures ( tags ) .
the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame must already be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as a comp@@ ile packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , what you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have a write permission on it ( eg by trying to copy the quer@@ or somewhat in the quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; for each ex@@ iting &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here , we specify the resulting co@@ di@@ ers to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) , and which structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the Free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we &apos;re not likely to change their settings at any time , if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is provided to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; read data / pieces .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbo@@ lic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be supplied , so a glance into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to use the existing entries for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . here are not much to do . here , an additional conversion will be defined . in our example it will be shown as shown in the screenshot .
only in case of in@@ complete information please ask , so you will be informed when data about j@@ ig@@ words ( tags ) are missing .
the map CD ; -@@ Settings . just select both items . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD ; data to automatically download the Internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
NOTE : the machine must be connected to the read out of the &amp; CD ; allowing the internet to access the Free@@ DB server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , begins immediately with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries , can be easily changed with the database entry and the tag / filen@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , this example is further to be observed when you wish to enter the selection boxes and Free@@ DB . however , you can download the selection boxes and Free@@ DB . however , you can download it twice if you &apos;re worth@@ while . in order to use Free@@ DB in offline use , the two selection ranges has to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map segment .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data enqu@@ iry , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; for information from Free@@ DB server about the Internet . as white the system , which data will be given to the CD ? read it all the way it is shown in the screenshot above .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page Fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and take a look at a mirror server in your area . on this way the load is spread between the computers . this setting is however first to work .
both work equ@@ ival@@ ently as the server concerned , because many fire@@ walls will bo@@ ast the protocol 88@@ 80 as standard , there are usually more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to sur@@ d on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transfer &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server ; the first check@@ box should be sufficient .
just take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the file / tmp is defined on your computer )
Number of simultaneously dis@@ fig@@ ured pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one of the same time with only one existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and coding ? the author knows not to try it yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : tick it around &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom files for temporary files : when you cross it , then the path / folder can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored , if only space is installed on another drive . if you don &apos;t forget the files in private files , if you don &apos;t want to make them something with WAV files .
all this as it is on the screenshot above . the command is slightly long , under circumstances , something must be blin@@ ded according to the right .
&apos;@@ --@@ Pre@@ set Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting output factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . it is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
NOTE the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of entry file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
use the rest as in screenshot . some comments on future use outside of this sample :
Number of simultaneous WAV files : with a dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be att@@ empt@@ ed to de@@ code more than a WAV file .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic furnishings of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; it is used as a standard for each read out of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section is described , as is described in the previous section as the process of the reader was set up and set up . first , we will create a connection to the internet , as we are comfortably and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ DB will be picked up . the process of the process is described in this section , must be repeated for each ex@@ iting &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in Free@@ DB , the screenshot can be a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn how to remove the &amp; CD ; data instead of retri@@ eve them from the Internet . comments will refer to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done so now the &amp; CD is ; into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a brief moment , the pieces and length in the window should be listed as in the screen . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; can be identified and from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this does not happen , check the questions and answers by the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been collected from Free@@ DB , all pieces of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the case it is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window built @-@ in , and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion the best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not have selected the check box for automatic query by Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings for the settings ) , you can also dis@@ solve this manually by selecting the first button . if you don &apos;t have a local database , it will need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 @-@ 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD &apos;s data and title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen screenshot . the title of the piece in the first row of the input field &apos; updated title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be given no more in the input field &apos; news Title &apos; unless you have a comp@@ ilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for single comments in@@ valid@@ ation . the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
warning : after the successful demand of the data from the Free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to see the content of the CD editor , so you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. either all words with letters of letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted notes .
NOTE : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comm@@ entary ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the tab character settings ; let it take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers or file formats . check the co@@ di@@ ers in order to obtain more information .
simply select one entry , which is obviously un@@ locked with the style of the ex@@ iting CD ; this example is not important because we will not transfer the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data any@@ ies@@ o . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for instance will be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &quot; you get back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the CD @-@ editor &apos;s window appears again and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have gathered for the first piece . simply give the title of the item in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure click the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
warning : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB . it is sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . NOTE that the artist and the album are displayed on the board .
NOTE that there is a check @-@ in before each line of each line . only the titles are selected . simply click on the line the choice of the piece is selected , or fill the button All tracks on the lower edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
when clicking on the button selection read the reading process , this window appears to be acknowled@@ ged . click OK and then we will create a look at the window with the proce@@ eds and track what goes .
click on the rider &apos;s request to turn off on the order window . it &apos;s in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the jobs . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window .
this error message you will notice if you are trying to work with a coding , which you don &apos;t have to have been successfully en@@ coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the client list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we checked here in the example . did you checked if you have typ@@ ed on the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first stage .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and coding in parallel . NOTE the status at the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found any configuration settings to read this behaviour . the use of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the use of the parallel processes is un@@ clear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to read and code ( from however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while a different piece will be coded and a third order in the waiting area is added , a small window will be added with a message for a short while in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . respectively 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the en@@ co@@ ders of your choice .
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; will be able to get there today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS use a pre @-@ compiled par@@ cel , da &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is . if you &apos;re reading this package you have already done it ...
this section is directed to people , compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of its distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program is adapted to your needs if it is running once , then is the following right for you :
a program that provides many different different programs , has many variants of settings . the best way you can read the options and settings . it shows screens of the different card types of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu is cli@@ cked on the program , without any c@@ lue as it will go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what &apos;s it ? who reads this , pres@@ um@@ ably the program has already started . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator . if you should always read or modify it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has sent this section and is therefore agreed with this suggest@@ ion .
strange if you have succeeded in taking the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N you don &apos;t need to use this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er from &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others he has a real @-@ time graphics and Kar@@ aoke @-@ real newspaper of texts also , some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; works under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus works on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supported by &amp; Linux ; Ultra@@ Sound project drivers , which is needed for CI@@ S cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with var@@ ying color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic display of the activity of any MIDI channel by setting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop that you can enter into &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to KM@@ id can be moved .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song , or text events ) .
seat support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; qu@@ it while playing a song , S@@ id will start playing back with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select your first file from the menu . it appears the usual file dialog , where you can select the required song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and tigh@@ ten the button Ab@@ bot in the tool@@ bar , select the record play from the menu item or st@@ aff@@ le the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts automatically , once you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window , they will be added to a collection and then played another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece is playing , you can jump at any point by using the middle mouse and drive off and drive .
if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows to turn left and right of the tem@@ po . to get the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , it causes printing on the space bar like a pressure on the button &apos;s break or the extension of the menu in the menu , inter@@ rupt@@ ing the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use lyrics event , others use lyrics event and other both . some songs have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events will be displayed , and even better : the sound @-@ type is automatically set if you select a song , so you &apos;ll have the opportunity to change the Kar@@ aoke text , but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a type of er@@ ect , select your entries , select text events or rec@@ ap@@ shots . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these are recorded in the series . in this section , how to use collection of files .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point . click on New and give the name for the collection .
you may also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included at the beginning the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the bun@@ dle down in the collection Manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . remember when you add a lot of pieces .
in order to add songs to a collection , you have to add a song in the collection Manager . there is again the file dialog , with which help you can choose the song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the settings for the collection .
when Autom@@ atically activated the collection , a piece can be added automatically by opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when Autom@@ atically add the collection to the collection , the opening of a piece will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you &apos;ll need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song , then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the menu sequence of menus , the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection .
if you are adding songs or remove any random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
to play a song for a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list over the Kar@@ aoke text .
to jump on a song , select the button next song , the next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song back to jump , select the button pre @-@ piece , the record previous piece of the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button del@@ e@@ tion .
the temporary collection could not be deleted . however , this does not play a role when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events can be translated into events that the syn@@ thesizer is under@@ stand@@ able .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus getting a trumpet sound if originally playing a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are compatible ( including A@@ WE - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
sorry , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . therefore , you have to edit the hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that saves all the required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear before the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which is so often appear as desired . the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but each occurr@@ ence is a different text ID ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... I define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... END OF KE@@ Y@@ MAP ... Find a further Key@@ map ... END OF CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END options ... END
you see that define it is needed to indicate that one section begins ( except options ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
this section shows how the patches sent from General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal name is igno@@ red . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that require this instrument to set the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not used for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which should be similar to like a tissue .
so if you should play a MIDI file with patch 127 ( R@@ if@@ le ) , it &apos;ll take Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the clay 60 , regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file .
please note that the term drum patch is shared with the term drum patch of patch , where every tone is a different percussion instrument ( Drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the sound level of the ever same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
like the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as their presence . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use several names in the first row .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to run tones on the per@@ cus@@ sions canal . watch as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be needed to de@@ duce some channels to another . if you want to sw@@ ap the first and second channel , simply do it in CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
N is the channel which is depic@@ ted on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , it will be able to use the key@@ map with the name Name for this channel . if you are igno@@ red by the For@@ ce@@ patch option , you will need to change the patch on this channel . in this case you will always use patch x .
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ cus@@ sions patch on the per@@ cus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is identified , in which ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events will be multip@@ lied with the value of n * ( r / 4096 ) and then passed on . the value 4096 is used , so that in the map file doesn &apos;t stop as dec@@ imal .
this setting is needed because GM provides a keyboard to play a pitch @-@ playing event with the value 4096 , a sound greater than playing . unfortunately , some key@@ boards will try to play two tones for up to one oc@@ t@@ ave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use an MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find them in the menu on Settings , point MIDI @-@ settings
the Channel view is a window with a whole range of Kla@@ vi@@ ets ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this manual you see which sounds can be played .
you can also use the channel to change the instrument on a specific channel . if you have changed a select list where you can select a instrument . if you have an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views to display the played sounds . in the menu , select Settings under the point of Channel : settings
the pace LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you , e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows turn left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it , like a music piece . it contains the music , the pace , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus the same MIDI file can be played on two different devices , just like two different musicians who can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can not only force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file requires around 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file requires a similar sound quality . in addition to a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , DE@@ B ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; to fix it . to elim@@ inate the problem , you have to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agreed , therefore Supp@@ orted &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
once you need to add the automatic shift to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to temporary collection .
you can use the arrow key on the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the pace , you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop work with my MIDI files and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I play a MIDI file ( if I play a MIDI file ) or h@@ ips ( if I play a MIDI file ) or I &apos;d like to play a file only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window switch and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file only , without adding them to a collection , turn off the Automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection .
let us take you , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . you only want to play the first file . so , select your automatic file to the collection and open your temporary collection then it contains exactly these MIDI file .
then join to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people were sent to me MIDI files or postcards . all thanks ! if I see these songs or watch the postcard , animated me to program further to &amp; k@@ mid ; .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; also I study at the University of Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time . I try to collect music files , music and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where you can download a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you wish to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
don &apos;t really make me a lot of fun , if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group ; if you want to send me a postcard or send an MIDI file , you should contact me as I already have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; full in my spare time and was w@@ ishing to get money back in my spare time and I would therefore emphas@@ ize that I &apos;m only going on it because I can only receive feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - re@@ taining the bug that the pitch of A@@ WE @-@ cards was too high .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the test@@ if@@ ies of the A@@ WE support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bie@@ ker , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Marc Die@@ fen@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magnus Wes@@ the@@ ider , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone that sent me a patch , an error message or also only a supporting email .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians in the web , who gives us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his home page , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also see the development of pages with other kar@@ aoke @-@ songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because it depends on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM device or a A@@ WE card .
if you don &apos;t have sound card , you must comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it works as if you could have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if any problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ m@@ peg . the program will be used to play video files from the M@@ Player or ph@@ on@@ on formats supported by DVD , VCD , or TV and Camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE site for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user ma@@ iling list .
the application window is formed from so called and@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . and finally , there is a window of information . and finally , there is an information window that will only appear when information appears .
it is possible to secure the preferred connection under the book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you wish to create a list of entries , which are to be played by each other , so you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional Hier@@ arch@@ ie@@ x . when you have an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category is copied and reproduction starts with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , Television and Perman@@ ent playlist may also be modified by directly editing of XML configuration files . of course you can only do when it is running , but also by the application itself . by clicking on a name of a category , it is necessary to select the XML content of this item by clicking on a name page .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu and selected either the edit mode , or select another category .
any changes are lost when the processing mode left or another group will be selected without delay .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on through changing the XML configuration files .
the animation of the Start and Finish can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ taining option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / .x@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
the animation of the starting does not need to be brief , it will automatically end through the opening of another source , but it would then end the user a second time at the end @-@ animation .
a simple example of an start animation can be the display of your favorite photos ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ defin@@ ite &quot; src = &quot; file : / / / home / Koo@@ s / m@@ um@@ .g@@ if &quot; get ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; ) ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path of the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from network and other things can be set .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player clearly .
there is no rider for this playlist in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . here is an example how a flash &apos; must be played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
Flash &apos;s can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in playlist .
to enter the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be back , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash .
the Cond@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is designed in a con@@ soles application while using error messages related to the loading of the browser Library . if there is no fault , the back@@ end issue is required within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from context menu ) .
this is always a given back@@ end for a particular hy@@ mes type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done through manual modif@@ ication of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on should re@@ play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before television , you need to be configured to use the device and the TV channels . this can be compiled with the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port you should be found ( for example it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name might probably contain a DVB .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ linux is also supported for the X server . therefore , it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
intern@@ ally become used by S@@ ME for the source different names . at the time of origin of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ source , carto@@ on@@ ource , tv@@ source , ur@@ ls@@ resource , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when activated , they start playing with the playback of the playlist .
are there some hin@@ ts how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive when I &apos;m playing from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
Yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be used as user root after setting the device . it is absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom shows at the CD@@ ROM Drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphic user interfaces and network support and becomes comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . on Unix @-@ like systems , it is probably used on the package &amp; tex@@ ture ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the &amp; Linux ; distribution program . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD should be moved .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ bu@@ tions . they permit a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website included .
this manual is for everyone , independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users need to hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for the documentation is required , the support of this project or documentation should be made via the k@@ ile ; web site should be made .
if you have any questions or comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; you should be asked for the ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ environment . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a simple , direct and tail@@ ored access to all rights as well as conversion and transformation tools for these . lock@@ able are to be easily operated , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate , and learn how to explore the hand@@ book for Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin by reading the developer with the Editor of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right le@@ pro@@ position : l@@ ay @-@ TECH . is the measure of the origin code &amp; cor@@ tex ; it is also possible to use a La@@ ie ( English @-@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic argument is that it is the name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a great review of &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book for this . by &amp; lat@@ ex ; you should know good books , e.g. H.

just like other recording languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction to be specified with the general properties such as paper format , page plate , and text size . the introduction must begin with the command \ \ document@@ class , and must be closed with the command \ \ inf@@ ill { document } and must be closed again .
the Quick entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a remote function for rapid production of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of Assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ r ) offers a few options for the creation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .
document methods : this includes the type of document generated by this document : article ( article ) , Letter &#91; Letter &#93; , Report &#91; Report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ 2@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ 2@@ cl &#93; , Pro@@ jector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; manual &#93; or user @-@ defined .
coding : this will be used as the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly used to use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . otherwise , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct work@@ manship of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used extra packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration they only be chosen in the cross @-@ field .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the documentation of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users can now worry about wor@@ ries . it is only a short description of the functions and further information provided in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also , - just like other source code ed@@ itors - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is not noticed by the mod@@ est appearance of the output file . however , it gets notice@@ able by the mod@@ est appearance of output file . however , it is supported by the emphasis of time and time .
with the automatic reading of the har@@ sh environments ( e.g. \ \ E. { var } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ ) and associated code ( e.g. \ \ ) command ; this function can be activated in the menu options ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; review of the document in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ tle element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be checked and watched by a mouse click on the respective drawing .
when creating it &apos;s own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; leg@@ ally &#93; file ( English D e V ice I n@@ v File ) &#93; created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file provides a description of the format document and also other information such as the font and is available in addition to PDF the Ã ¼ s@@ output types of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for view , transformation and print out of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the field search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor is click on a DVI ; file it is click on the exact opposite . once upon a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , is used for the respective passage in DVI ; viewer is bur@@ gl@@ ed .
Master @-@ document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified with other in@@ bound .@@ tex files . when using a project , project program can be set up with a project project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will automatically be displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
file support : in this mode the DVI ; file is based on Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ es@@ â s . , and there is no appeal by &amp; eye@@ piece ; according to the quick installation .
with consider@@ ation of the editing tool bar , the three large numbers of choice should be developed for the rapid amount of common elements in the document . the first selection box is for the rapid amount of document in parts , chapter , sections , ... The nar@@ r@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders for the division are :
the drop down sel@@ ector is available for articles such as keywords , Fu@@ els , no@@ des or links . the available methods are :
name : with this command you will have a section for a section , a picture or other element .
concerning : to be used for reference to a specified name ( selection for a selection box ) .
when using a quote , a list of literature will be displayed . for &amp; Bib@@ Te@@ X ; it works only if the file is necessary in a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; kb@@ ib@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; Bib@@ Te@@ X ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the foot@@ notes , etc . it will be the following documents :
when calling us &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria for creating a new document are supported by selecting the document type and pro@@ found@@ ly of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by the hand .
the brackets for the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the text can not be determined by default . if the font is not defined at the beginning , this can also be done in text .
once the source code text sample has to be compiled , &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is to use the operation of building or the button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
the comp@@ iling of the document is missing , should be found in the protocol following the faul@@ ts . when using folder custom@@ ization and eye@@ piece ; this is not the case , the recording should also be respec@@ ted .
an area ( English ) is a text that will be treated differ@@ ently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the written format will have been created and only a few SÃ ¨ s will have a different font . the command \ \ etc . \ \ end { environment } encour@@ ages the opening of the writ@@ ers in the environment - the Ries@@ ig@@ â s . ( in English ) .
the subsi@@ dies will be reserved only within the area ( from \ \ oration { environment } to \ \ end { ks } ) . there are no evidence ( number ) for the shipping within a environment .
there are many M@@ Ã ¶ n@@ ications to ease your read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , sub@@ str@@ acts , sub@@ str@@ acts , sub@@ str@@ actions , etc . they can either be added to the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ t } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is as long as G@@ Ã ¼ l@@ tig , until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ t } or another environment . one single word in one sentence can be shown with \ \ sen@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote from the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after the background to writing the source code with &amp; lat@@ ex ; label language , follows now a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the wiz@@ ard a bit text was entered , there should be a quote for the better read@@ ability of the document . these should be min@@ d. a quote , a few positions in the grease and a po@@ em to the application , to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be re@@ printed by editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E ( on the internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and have fun .
DVI ; is a file format file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ v ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Con@@ version or computer screen .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are as for how to view the document ( see ) . when the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar ex@@ changed the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code has been created , the conversion should begin with the Kn@@ Ã ¶ P@@ FE in the tool@@ bar .
the advance search could be used to direct jump from Editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ ders . just click to set up the Modern ™ settings ... tools must be chosen .
to search for the advance search , the mouse po@@ inter must be cli@@ cked on a line of source search and click on pre @-@ search button . the jump to the respective place in DVI ; viewer takes place .
this function in &amp; eye@@ piece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; k@@ ile ; it is necessary and for the corresponding line ; I need &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; eye@@ piece ; selected as a text editor ... Editor )
if using quick installation of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot be able to present a mistake . should an error present , this will be displayed in the recording file or the news window .
the recording file can be found in the source code . in the editor , the Kn@@ Ã ¶ P@@ FE Previous @-@ Er@@ ror and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X @-@ errors are always seen in the error . to view the error in the recording , the file must be cli@@ cked on the faul@@ ts and k@@ k@@ ile ; jumps to def@@ ective line .
once on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will be cli@@ cked on the selection of the re@@ usable template for the document . the set programs are available :
when selecting an empty document , a document may be either re @-@ written or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
hand@@ ful users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to nearly all documents . templates are created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facil@@ itate creating a new document .
to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file format or a new file created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and choose from the template of document .
when creating a new document , using a new document , some string chains replaced by other data ( i.e. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in ways to set up settings .
to create your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings of which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SOP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string will be substit@@ uted by entering the category class : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SOP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and that is related to the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps has been finished :
when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the standard devices .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . it is necessary to create a simple way to create a template , should be performed by one on the Internet and performed in described steps .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the M@@ Ã ¶ AND of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bib@@ Te@@ X ; ) . many edit@@ ings for &amp; Kate ; can be made out of menu item directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
to learn more about Kate and Kate &apos;s guide , the hand@@ book should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; here you can start with reading the chapter of Beauty by the Editor &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command set , which can be called for the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . they enth@@ r@@ ens an out description for almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; how to find use and their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed Ctrl key to enhance the &amp; tex ; -@@ word that means that in this way , click on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ sk@@ ip merely \ \ par .
when pul@@ ling the text with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button , the text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , the pieces of the source code can be combined in the ed@@ itor@@ window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; the M@@ Ã ¶ ace@@ fulness has the various kinds of source texts to search and to emphas@@ ise this . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders from the normal text and also the mathem@@ atical form@@ ulas are emphas@@ ized by another color .
many Assist@@ ants can be included in addition , it is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ bar@@ gain controls the jump to n@@ Ã ¤ n@@ els or last jump mark . this jump brand is also emphas@@ ized , so they will be automatically qualified for the first input of a drawing .
the work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already offers great items for writing . &amp; lat@@ ex ; always supported many environments and groups and therefore under their choice . under special features , the following commands are included :
if a text is made out of ( group of lines , which contain on both sides of a blank lines ) . this extended importance is not a text with per@@ tin@@ ent lines . this extended importance is not a text , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source . the only be@@ u@@ cle@@ ated thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the query can be separated by two empty lines .
if the word has been made under the current c@@ ursor position . this option also has an extended meaning , since this command is also bo@@ di@@ lat@@ ex ; orders with an area ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for drawing a part of this document , it can be removed by pressing the button Ctrl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the whole line . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands this includes the following commands to read the text of the text :
removed a complete paragraph . definition of a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing the paragraph .
it has already been noted that environments are a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for NF further commands under control and for a great simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current area ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command trig@@ gers to the end of the current area ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the structure of the environment .
if the c@@ ursor is begin before or within the command \ \ E. { surroundings } , the end of the environment will be in@@ jected to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
at the input of many f@@ lin@@ ated ambient conditions can be lost quickly to the opening statements . this command will be able to den@@ ounce the last environment , so that the missing environment structure could not be ref@@ unded .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . among others Te@@ X group are some important commands given to those of the environment .
with this command , the c@@ ursor is placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the ru@@ ff@@ ered clamp .
with this command trig@@ gers to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the sli@@ pped clamp .
if the c@@ ursor is off or behind the p@@ inn@@ ed cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is located , then the other end of the group is in@@ jected ( or vice versa ) .
at the input of many loose groups of cl@@ amps , the group cl@@ amps can be lost too soon . this command stopped the last group , so that the missing structure of the &amp; tex ; groups can not be clo@@ cked .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple adjust@@ ments are used as G@@ Ã ¤ n@@ se@@ w . for the purpose of execution , the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign is suitable for two simple instructions . for this case , the sign is suitable for two simple adjust@@ ing characters for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic set @-@ up for double support can be set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be set up and power .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) , and thus can be used as a lot of other languages too .
when pus@@ hing from Shift ; Input button to get &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line @-@ break@@ through . if the current position is located within a lists of environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ates or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line @-@ up@@ heav@@ al but also the command \ \ item .
connect your current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ bring to the current line in a tables .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to gain pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be set up under settings .. La@@ Te@@ X can be moved .
some users were able to arrange the columns for tables in tables . &amp; k@@ ile ; tries to encour@@ age one another . when this tab@@ ulator is not allowed to be used . when this tab is missing , it is necessary to add &amp; k@@ ile ; some spaces for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; Kate is already a good source code reading , these in &amp; k@@ ile ; they are still extended by special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are installed and the other two are suitable for automatic scanning modes . all these modes can be set up under settings ...
at the beginning of a new environment through the command \ \ begin { surroundings } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { setting } according to an empty row ( for the text ) .
when drawing the field , the last character of the input is removed and reduced the result list . on the other hand , the list can also be resi@@ zed by entering a further letter .
all commands are removed with a brief description of their arguments . the description of the description are removed by selecting from &amp; k@@ ile ; also jump to these positions by editing the jump brand N@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ste jump is possible and the wanted parameters can be connected .
under Settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; can be made to these lists . there are different ways of items for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ Ã ¼ cher of common language uses will be chosen .
the command mode is not supported for the handling of environments . it will always be used as a few letters with \ \ dep@@ artments . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of the environments .
when calling the full @-@ area mode , the command will be fully initiated and the key to the opening of the environment will be automatically ro@@ uted and it appears , \ \ begin { . afterwards the ambient le@@ stick will continue in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be termin@@ ated by pus@@ hing the input key .
once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogn@@ izes that there is a first \ \ item command with inser@@ ts .
sub@@ set among settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; able settings to these lists . this mode uses the list of the kn@@ itting mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders .
&amp; k@@ ile ; additionally , custom lists of ab@@ bre@@ eds . the lists can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... for example , the lists can be set up under settings ... file ex@@ ample@@ .c@@ w@@ l , for example , the file ex@@ ample@@ .c@@ w@@ l is included in the file name L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L is typ@@ ed in the book , and the word is handled by the string of the Ctrl + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
big W@@ Ã ¶ s W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher is not helpful for automatic reading costs . however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ n@@ ter will be written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion of the file is already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu of tile ... k@@ ile rein@@ forcement . here , the threshold value for the display can be specified .
the file inser@@ tion files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / or / k@@ ile / complete / mode / the per@@ former home folder . mode is available for bre@@ vi@@ ation ( ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ si ) or tex .
the dialog for Graphics is sort of graphics as simple as possible . for consider@@ ation the basics of the graphics form , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not known as PDF files , but offer an outstanding basis for the dis@@ abilities and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are newly arranged and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file will be converted to PDF file .
to inspec@@ t the outcome of work experiences , the source code must be compiled . all components are group@@ ed together into the menu , create converting and create viewing .
for comp@@ iling the source code for vie@@ wers such as &amp; eye@@ piece ; or another conversion can be used with Ctrl ; 3 ; afterwards , the DVI ; -@@ file is converted to a PS file via Alt ; 4 , and via Alt ; 5 the PS file is considered .
when using the command , a viewer will normally be called for comp@@ iling . if no @-@ in viewer should be used , each time it will be a new window .
a new project will be asked about the project &apos;s new project .... The following information is asked for the project :
when using the file name -@@ Fen@@ sters the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r -@@ project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allow the export of EC@@ MA@@ Script @-@ Ko@@ en . the scripts can be managed to create a script@@ ing in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet evol@@ ved and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
first of all , it must be said that the scripts of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system@@ ic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinct system in which the basic functions can be extended by a large number of multiple packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ ture ; they are delivered with many documents . this includes a documentation for the pack@@ ets and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a full @-@ digit Re@@ ale for &amp; tex ; and s@@ ein@@ e@@ â ; Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â s . . here it is not only for a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but it is ideal for searching for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . because it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; into three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k offers , which provides a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; related documents and here for a graphic design surfaces .
all documents are divided into categories , and the great advantage is the search of package sections or keywords . by &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .

the plug@@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly can do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it may benefit from the additional functionality and you must not wait until someone can use the s@@ cour@@ er into &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements you will find below .
to install an plug@@ in or a part , let &apos;s start with the plug@@ ins menu . this means the following dialog is opened :
this dialog allows to manage all plug@@ ins to manage and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element inside :
here you can enter the search path . when plug@@ ins without a memory site uses &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to sear@@ ches of plug@@ ins .
many people often work in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties tab .
the name and email entries are self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ ing . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to un@@ clear identify .
one member can have several ro@@ les in the project , such as team leader as well as sub @-@ project leader .
the user can look for himself from the list of Team members who is looking for . this happens when he sear@@ ches the team member from the list and the button S@@ etz@@ e as pressing . the currently selected member ( their identification ) seems to be bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and setting of their own identity is important for news and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage of the members of the team : there is an event for information to the team leader when something specific is happening . see in for more information .
event actions are actions which are executed when something specific in the project is done . one example would be to describe how much someone wanted to work on it , or a script that will convert a file to CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Side Event Con@@ figuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties button lets events create , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the recip@@ ient of the recip@@ ient . the address can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such ladder can be set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
notes type is simple . it can be either selected or input from the Editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment area followed by graphic text .
ob@@ serv@@ ations can be sent a member of the team members . in this case , the nick@@ name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , being a leading role in the project from the team member , the corresponding asset or sub@@ project leaders should lead the relevant asset or sub@@ project leaders , as described in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and cast@@ ors names are independent of large or lo@@ wer@@ case , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the numbers are in@@ valid .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script@@ ing and form@@ att@@ ing languages supported by DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script@@ ing languages .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for others can be found .
the settings can be set up with Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog is extended to a few pages that are covered in suc@@ cession .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including auto@@ comp@@ action can thus be changed . the entries are :
large / lower fri@@ ction of tags : large / small storage of automatically added tags . normal large / inf@@ lo@@ graphy means , the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of at@@ tributes : large / inf@@ or@@ tho@@ graphy of automatically added at@@ tributes . normal child / inf@@ lo@@ graphy means , the at@@ tributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if h@@ act , is optional for tags that is optionally available for the final day , that is right after &amp; gt ;
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
automatically update the starting and end day : if it is switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and inver@@ sely .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent elements : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during the typ@@ ing .
MIME types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . using the standard , the default specifications can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or embedded files ( where the encoding of the file may be passed ) , but this setting is thrown by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files that DT@@ D is not detected , but this setting is excluded from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; created regular backup copy , allowing for a power failure or crash when the program is recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . also , a backup is regularly updated , according to the set time produced .
the preview and documentation can be displayed in the editor of ed@@ itors or a view ( or documentation within a map series ) which makes it possible to view the preview and the source code simultaneously .
set the window settings on the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through modif@@ ying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / susp@@ end views of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ worm command parameter parameters .
the warning message area serves taxes of the possibility to dis@@ able war@@ nings of war@@ nings from no more inqu@@ iries .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may display the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be dis@@ continued in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change by clicking on the ground floor with the mouse buttons .
in the structural timber settings , vis@@ ibility of tree is automatically opened to the tree and how deeply in a change of structural tree is automatically opened , empty spaces are to be adjusted , while empty groups are found in which no element found in the current document .
the area for defin@@ ing ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that are dis@@ sol@@ ete with re@@ sign@@ aled text . ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be considered for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are actually used by third page , which can be used by any part of the application , the most well known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug@@ ins , the following must be :
address : the path to the plug@@ in , if it is not on a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will open the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the current file ( path of current file ) or the folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is refused to load the plug@@ in . just @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts does not den@@ y the load if this option is not selected .
check the plug@@ in : if this is activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the specified information is correct . then , if the plug@@ in is not available in the moment the plug@@ in is not available , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the bug @-@ search was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) deb@@ ugger . instead , a deb@@ ugger @-@ Plugin concept was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations on plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , supporting the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add .
the use of the deb@@ ugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable deb@@ ugger @-@ plug@@ ins in the Project Properties . the Options button next to the deb@@ ugger @-@ Plugin provides the specific settings .
if a deb@@ ugger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the contents of super@@ vised variables . normally appears in the left dock .
a view , in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed normally . normally appears in the lower dock .
a view , where the output is shown ( as in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ gers all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the deb@@ ugger , if necessary , or it shares the plug@@ in with , on de@@ bug rules if a project is opened if a deb@@ ugger that doesn &apos;t have to be respec@@ ted on it .
the counter@@ part of Deb@@ ug@@ ging Session Start the meeting . includes the connection to the deb@@ ugger or termin@@ ates the leaves .
send a HTTP request to the server to include a Deb@@ ug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is shown in the deb@@ ugger Edition .
indicates the deb@@ ugger , with the execution of the script and the currently led line continuously . if this happens while the script is done , the execution proce@@ eds before a deb@@ ug@@ request has begun , the script will start with the request .
indicates the deb@@ ugger , with the execution of the script , without inform@@ ing the variables and the current line number if this happens while a script has been given before a deb@@ ug@@ request has been given , the execution starts as soon as a request has been made .
the deb@@ ugger will execute the next pres@@ cription in the script , without running into the functions or includes .
the deb@@ ugger will execute the next pres@@ cription in the script if possible in functions and includes faul@@ ts .
shows the deb@@ ugger that the order to go and go to the next way , as would it not be the current .
opens a dialog box where a variable or expression can be input which is monitored . the monitored value appears in the comp@@ ilation view .
this dialog can set a variable , or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter explains how you can custom@@ ize &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to adapt to your needs and how you can and quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; can help you get better .
document type ed@@ itors ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore , to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . they enable &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ability to give ease and flexibility ; for fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are in two ways , family 1 , the characters and family 2 , the script languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bars . day folder contain two file types , the text and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and di@@ alogs of image buttons ( above the additi@@ ve @-@ window ) , insert text and instructions faster in a document called one user ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be prepared ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details on the conversion .
this document describes how to create XML files , create &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific at@@ tributes for tags and the content and content of the propri@@ et@@ di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file holds the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars enable a fast insert of tags in a document without any danger .
tag folder are not known as a folder . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and the day XML files . tag folders bear the name of the read @-@ language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML &quot; and decl@@ are whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use so many as possible to allow other users a better viewing and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes any element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be made in an easy way .
this is the root element of an day XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain a just element type above themselves otherwise .
the tag type is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; One argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only for the day type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
just valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common at@@ tribute group and at@@ tributes within these tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
descri@@ bing a at@@ tribute of a tags . this element can only appear once for each at@@ tribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this at@@ tribute is to be displayed , and etc ; This is a only element type element .
specif@@ ies the source of source codes for at@@ tributes in day @-@ Ed@@ itor@@ dialog and tribute tree to the at@@ tribute dialog .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; will be used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p metho@@ d@@ Name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and one process name . the arguments given to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ less % , which means the name of the current Tags .
a container tag that group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an at@@ tribute description . it is a only element type element .
specif@@ ies the position of at@@ tribute within a dialog box within a dialog . this tag can only occur in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and the size of a field in dialog . this tag should be available for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements which occur within the specified tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just element type .
all di@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ cle@@ ation starts : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at and closed .
spaces affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be done by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ any &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to ver@@ ify the XML files , the tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ M . another dialog is published , whose simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , checking only when charging the daily XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; Schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Schema . the filen@@ ame for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
an example of a function@@ ing family 2 day XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the filen@@ ame of this day XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor , accessible via DT@@ D function . thus , you can be di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be created with a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
an action can set up with Settings ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut of this promotion . with clicking the user button , a ke@@ ep@@ le button can be assigned . with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ ens is removed .
the eas@@ iest actions . it can be inserted into the detailed settings and with execution of this text , this text is inserted in the document on the current c@@ ursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action yp . using the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which are started or as input ( or parts of the document ) are started . examples from &amp; the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Script@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is advis@@ able to use the % script@@ ing variable in command line , such as sh are script@@ ing / my@@ script@@ .@@ sh@@ . In this way , try to find the script : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of current document . in the case of a local document , file is removed : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ process replaced . if by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is used only if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the filen@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script can receive input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the default input can be adjusted . in the drop down dialog , the default input can be specified . options are :
selected text : the selected field of the document is sent to the script . usually , the % input variable is normally useful only with this setting .
according to the input , also the output of the executed application can be directed . there are two types of output : normal output , based on the standard output . it can be specified , which is set to the default output by default output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in this case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand .
once you have added a tool@@ bar , you need to add or configure any actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory . press the new action at the bottom end of the window starts working mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
fill out all and if the day at@@ tributes has and you are planning to use the dialog box , call dialog , if available for entering the action of action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit . choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol is not only helps you to notice what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered as sil@@ ly , rigid , further interpre@@ ted ; it should be drawn ; it is ready ; it is ready ; - day in the current document ) .
after creating the symbol you need to be connected with the action . this happens on the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is , select it and confirm by OK .
press the button and commit them with other tags , so it still gives , or confirm you with OK to complete .
supp@@ ose you want to comp@@ lement some common &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool bar and it should be able to adjust the tool to better overview with some differences in multiple groups . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( on top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after choosing the element it is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to add a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator will support the group@@ ing . anyone , who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by giving all the symbols to make sure everything works .
if Neu@@ e@@ XML is not existing , it will be setup im@@ bal files , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) is required ( will ) if a file is opened by the according type .
perhaps the most not@@ able extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script@@ ing language or the form@@ att@@ ing language which you like most . this is why I describes a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check back the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ re@@ pository , if anyone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search a existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then , you must create the doc@@ rc file . we &apos;ll have to tell you the first part we &apos;ll be treated here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements described in the Main Index Top element = your description for such document@@ aries such as &amp; PHP , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , check out now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 operating system = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting started , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
NOTE that # In front of Get@@ ting started and Language Reference . it shows that it is not known for sub@@ folder in a tree with its own content . there is no known border for the batt@@ les@@ bi@@ ds ( except through the exter@@ mination ) md@@ ash . but try it out .
NOTE that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently ) at the top end of the top view &amp; md@@ ash ; direc@@ tories is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; res@@ p files .
the document section is the range of the doc@@ rc file , which is intended to be displayed by using a &amp; PHP ; scripts for the m@@ ys@@ ql _ fet@@ ch _ array function . by pressing the function and pressing the documentation here . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file downlo@@ ad@@ able .
a simple list of written context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ rc to save and either to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( such as doc@@ rc code and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these well and it is worth to be shared , send your doc@@ rc files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud of being involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the dis@@ cri@@ pts resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with promotions , scripts , templates ) to others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send via email to friends , partners or else by whom you send an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email ship , in context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , where all others &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can be downloaded and only available when our team is considered a correct and useful for publishing , if our team does not provide a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are in demand for your private G@@ PG key ( the passport cannot be saved ) , or in the case you have to look for several key . in the dialog New resource you need to stay longer ( URL preview can be empty ) and starting with OK the up@@ loading process will be started .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , Tool@@ bar , Tool@@ bar , and in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource is war@@ ned and the sign@@ ation . if the integrity , and the resource is given accurate and the resource is correct , appears as a result with the indication of the ur@@ ine of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is necessary to work by adding a D@@ TE@@ P package . it gives the sim@@ pler way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be used from DT@@ D store and converting a DT@@ D menu . then select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target version name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ itive header : the string used in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PUBLI@@ C - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after the conversion : if activated , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; -@@ editor , with details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these concepts and powerful benefits from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so you must first try to close these concepts with these fundamental concepts without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefits .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided in three areas : global , locally and projector . this differenti@@ ation affects a range of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars over actions , it is stored in the joint folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it allows the group of admin@@ istrat@@ ors to secure action to secure actions and patterns in a global tree , which will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . this is user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; - patterns can be customized for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which are supported by all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Ed@@ itor@@ window , the module &apos;s window with information and the tool . please contact in , and for further information about these areas .
click to click into a context menu with the right mouse button , to re@@ load a context menu with the current document possible , re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump into book@@ marks or execution of CVS commands to present the current document .
right @-@ click in the Ed@@ itor@@ region lead to another context menu regarding the revised document mode , such as basic mach@@ ining steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , the word below the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file , when the string is described under the mouse po@@ inter .
at the top of the Ed@@ itor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers you are currently using &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional as a standard to which a set of tool will be shown . in the course of the further extension of tools , the tool@@ bar will be adjusted to the new features and thereby connected user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , for example &amp; lt ; in your document , you should insert the date for that just added day . now , you can insert a day that fill several at@@ tributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the components ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate in the information to &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate to open and play through . in the presentation with boxes , document systems , scripts , at@@ tributes and documentation components are available .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by far right click . actions as adding , remove , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu .
another way of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website and etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which it can be used in which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the respective users and templates are available in the project . more on templates are available .
here you will find information about the available script@@ ing languages . the concept of the integration in Global , local and project works well here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can call the available information to a script . via the right mouse button , you can start writing , edit or send your script via email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on it , the c@@ ursor is placed on the position of the element . by the right @-@ clicking an element it opens a list of commands regarding navigation and r@@ hin@@ ts of the tree .
this tree appears among the other buildings . with it can change at@@ tributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . these can be updated to the contents of all available at@@ tributes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development . you can create documentation site for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation and supported by adding a folder in doc , editing and viewed a project .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two card drivers at the bottom end of the window can be achieved - the user window and the problem window .
this card holder shows information on each in Qu@@ anta running script . such as the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes are displayed for DT@@ D .
this card guides shows all mist@@ akes in the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there is ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bar are exten@@ sively expanded and easy to understand . they are shown on a symbol and they receive the according command . the chocolate is able to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; K@@ Mail . if it has received a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure them in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable when you want to con@@ struct the site of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to adjust files on your system . for example , auto@@ conf you can pass a number of options that can be configured to configure the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path no . 3 am folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of her bin Fol@@ ders . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a large powerful features .
during the effort , the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an exceptional idea , what if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , ext@@ endable up @-@ language editor would be ? well , this would do it for the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML , limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already on the way to a general and extensive web development tool . summar@@ ize , if you can define it into &amp; XML ; then , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore suitable for the application / IDE ;
well , to the above mentioned claim must be said that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows that , in good use of free software , the idea of what anyone has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ s@@ caff@@ old , not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows Web@@ developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . it can expand the productivity of virtually any task . by using the program compression and tools , they can clearly know without any exec@@ utable language syntax . ( read more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly developed to a mat@@ ured editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developer sent the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details here is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either these URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta run ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and served by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for the future use . you should try to save the file / text outside the local / project program folder , only an error will be reported .
convert from the cli@@ p@@ board from the cli@@ p@@ board there contained a special sign to &amp; HTML ; -@@ s@@ ore , so that they can be displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ s@@ ore , which is the correct way to paste special characters and space in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used to paste &amp; URL ; s into the anch@@ ors day .
switches the block@@ range or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if you are running PHP ; -@@ Script messages !
sear@@ ches a string of a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre@@ defined ex@@ pressing will help you .
displays the news window at or not on . this is the window where you can see the script@@ ing actions and deb@@ ugger .
- and turning the problem cl@@ ut@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main sequence . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you are changing to the structural tree .
shows the symbo@@ lic links from the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if using book@@ marks in the current file , it will appear in the menu with entries of previous or next , depending on the curs@@ ors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents in the menu will be group@@ ed according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory according to new files that could be there . this allows for example to add video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded other input modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , how &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find details .
invites one project tool@@ bar . they are kept in re@@ pository / tool@@ bars and are only added to this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog box to store your tools . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . which only created the name . actions must be added by means of tool@@ bars . you are stored on tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
remo@@ ves a tool bar out of the sight area . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you don &apos;t have saved the tool bar , you are asked if you want to do that .
so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team , with that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item will open a new email message using the tool@@ bar .
enables loading of tool@@ bar to the main server , where every other can access them . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you did or anything else has done and convert to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own dead@@ lines .
to rene@@ w the ent@@ ities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is mean@@ ing@@ ful if the ent@@ ities of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not available , it does not fail .
this menu includes a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a menu menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allow access to the current day setting dialog , when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ men@@ s .
activated and de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent paste of tags . it only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent displays means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; paste using tool bar , when this day is ref@@ ute to the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu points . click on it . click on an activated plug@@ ins de@@ activated .
choose the current survey mode for the current file . the list of available origin schem@@ es depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
choose the Type of line identification . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limit@@ ations in the K@@ DE libraries you need time or cause im@@ perfect graphics . recommended is the card slot mode , which is also the default window mode , which comp@@ lies in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition this menu provides an entry for each open window . with selecting a single entry , the corresponding window will be activated .
to@@ g@@ gles the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main chief or off .
the changes in this dialog appears any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; Web@@ brow@@ s@@ ers .
judge the behavior of the Ed@@ itor@@ f@@ enst@@ ich . in the documentation of &amp; Kate , you &apos;ll find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete items from the tool , or add the sequence and changes .
this should not create a help accordingly to the maus@@ oleum , but it is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with every open source project , developers can always use the help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , click here the way .
the fields are self @-@ ex@@ plan@@ atory and should be filled up at the top of the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information can be automatically set up later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . in the input name , file will be completed automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ project file . by default , it has stored the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine , to which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ample@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
lets use this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocols are used . depending on the remote computer , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a common collection of files used for different projects , this file should be set rather than the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects , this file should be set rather than the standard .
this allows to add files from the local files@@ ystem . you can be selected multiple files or entire folder .
this setting is great if you want to download and modify the static web site , you can download and modify . when using server script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed in a different manner .
act @-@ act when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be bound . if a project is started ane@@ w , it is not oblig@@ ed .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the folder and you can make a precise selection of the crew .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files through investors , or by removing the tick , from the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings which can simp@@ lif@@ y your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded with Project Properties in the menu of the menu in the menu window profile or using the C@@ TRL Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some flags will correspon@@ d to those in the project assistant , and are explained in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of filen@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) , which are igno@@ red in project operations like project folder .
additional option to above , even files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project . can be read more about project prospects .
the desired deb@@ ugger can now be selected . it is currently only supported by G@@ ub@@ ed . the deb@@ ugger @-@ Plugin can be used with the Options button . the deb@@ ugger that is described in the deb@@ ugger .
in the sub@@ windows profiles up@@ loading , high load profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted as well as display of a module for the contents of the server for each profile by adding a separate building view for each profile .
in the Under@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . look for details .
in the lower window event configuration , you can turn off event actions and add these actions , change or delete events . event actions are executed if a previously specified event occurs as to en@@ rich in a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project was opened . this behavior can not affect .
to open another project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project open and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . they are asked if you want to save the changes before leaving , if you are exp@@ ecting a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder be@@ have likewise , however , the entries are opening and open ... in the right mouse menu with the right mouse menu :
different profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the site of up@@ loaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and is forgotten by programming . this option is useful if necessary up@@ loading files is necessary and the more un@@ secure password from the disk will not be found in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ speed profiles can be created and thus up@@ loaded the project ( or parts of the project ) to various servers . during editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed k@@ io sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . usually this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate at the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ st@@ ion , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . if your password is stored on the disk , it is not easy to read , but everyone with program knowledge can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view can be loaded , and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved in the menu or the project tool@@ bar , re@@ achable on Settings tool bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows custom@@ ization of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own work@@ ings .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; most of the menu tool@@ bars are available . use and add of tool to add in the section Add of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols are set to be set either by the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , other actions such as tool bar can be performed which can be performed in the dialog , where indicated in the dialog , where can be specified , which actions will be visible on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to a tool ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries will remove the promotion and action , which are self ex@@ plan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool ... and adjust@@ ments actions set .
templates are in key document chain , code @-@ car@@ ving and files for lin@@ k@@ way . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates , like a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move it or any system existing in the local@@ ity . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limit@@ ations you have to push for the files@@ ystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template .
binary is everything that is not pur@@ er text . it can be included any file apart from text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; b , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary lists in documents by means of links ( e.g. images with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples are usually found in the stock tree under global templates . other information on templates are available .
documents can be written by any text documentation . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be generated in accordance with the purpose and organ@@ izes work in this way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the stock tree under global templates . look for more information on templates .
this kind of templates are useful when you should not include a new document based on a template , but the same text area is to be inserted into the documents . they can be found in the stock tree under global templates . see in for more information on templates .
as the name says , these templates are used for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder structure . currently , there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a documentation structure after application ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As a template . store your template down ....
once that occurred , you notice that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . watch in the lag@@ tree under project paper .
select text in your document and click on file The template to store as a local / project template . alternatively , the choice can be easily drawn with pul@@ ling and put on the tree view templates .
creating binary templates is simple : the file is just enough to copy the file . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pul@@ ling and dis@@ assem@@ ble or add the storage space of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can also select a file space or in the project files tree view onto a folder right and secure site template , and secure a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be saved as a local or global template .
project documentation allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert header and foot@@ er , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , create files or link with them . in addition , there is a few things to use templates in projects very deep in mind .
the system structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and $ HOME / Qu@@ anta / Tem@@ plates and
to specify the behavior of a folder , click the folder with the right mouse button to select the folder and to select the text menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop down sel@@ ector with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low , once el@@ ter@@ able at@@ tributes can be adjusted .
this is enabled by default and if a regular folder would be enabled . if a regular folder would be enabled , it would be explic@@ itly enabled . in case of a normal order , the Bla@@ h would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a regular folder .
allows using or presented text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , we have a context menu ( press on the right mouse menu ) via a complete command collection for adding folders , or copy and paste templates from a place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which will be re@@ achable via the menu View . the first mode is re@@ placing the source code in two parts : the source code editor and V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it invites you to edit a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor . then , you can edit and return the source code editor , where the performed changes are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains PHP ; it shows a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ enh@@ y of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Editor is still the source code editor . there are no plans to alter such behaviour .
the second mode is just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor syn@@ ch@@ ron . with pressu@@ res in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , this mode is already active , if the button is maintained in a window to the others , where the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta and you can automatically choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in the selection , the recommendation can be adjusted between synchron@@ ization after a single click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is a small f@@ ir for fast calcul@@ ator and a large sp@@ oil for slow .
supp@@ ose you want to change the title of the website , thus the editing of invisible tags in the work with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called upon as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . thus , you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allows the storage of information about the document itself i.e. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click into the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of design@@ ing the look@@ out pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules to the list below the list or delete a change above the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by selecting the file and select the file .
the use of the c@@ ursor is as in a word processor , because of moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the c@@ ursor is strange and the marking works as usual . text can be inserted as usual , and can be deleted by typ@@ ing button or distances .
past@@ ing tags will be made in the same way about the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it is too aware that the inser@@ tion of tags is not removed if a anchor day , surrounded by text , each other must be removed .
some tools like the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists of wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later on &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining sty@@ li@@ ances . in contrast to other programs , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be followed .

there are many graphic tools for compar@@ ing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain how I was written .
the assem@@ bling was very complicated , because one of the contributions had been made and simultaneously re@@ vis@@ ing the re@@ jection . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflic@@ ts while con@@ tribut@@ ors .
the program used by myself was only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no hin@@ ts to the places where perhaps only the revers@@ ing was a small album .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences between one line and changes made to white signs . later , many more useful functions have been added .
for example , if you would like to compare the text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function which made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way inter@@ ference will be fully supported if two persons are working independently in one piece en@@ code and make changes in the same time . the collaboration Editor makes it possible . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result by editing three quiz files at the same time :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you con@@ struct the compar@@ is@@ ons and merge files . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; con@@ dens@@ ed by folder co@@ con@@ es :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and adjusted to the features of current color monitors . if you often have to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , this can be seen at a glance at the view@@ point in the column at the left side . ( no more off@@ ence changes . )
when a file is equal , and the other diff@@ ers in one line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both differ to files .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can facil@@ itate the typ@@ ing program by using only the file name of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Fol@@ der 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o Ziel@@ ord@@ ner k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 -@@ o Ziel@@ ord@@ ner
the opening dialog allows manual type of filen@@ ames to select the selection of a file browser ( file ... ) or select a file in the next time . you will not specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
through the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ is@@ ons or mer@@ ging of folders . if for A file is selected , for B and C , but uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A to the two other folders .
when merge operation is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to specify a output file immediately . you can take this step even later .
the setup will open a dialog with settings . here , you can set options before you start with the compar@@ is@@ ons / mer@@ ging .
sometimes , you don &apos;t want to compare the file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active comparison window . in the opening dialog , you do not need to select any files , you can easily connect the dialog with the inter@@ rupt button .
you can also use drag and finish : just drag an file from a file or selected text from an editor and let it fall by a compar@@ ative window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains several similar features . if you want to figure out how similar these features are , they would have to create two relevant files , they can easily copy and compare the relevant sectors . now , you can copy and compare the relevant sectors .
NOTE : currently you can &apos;t get anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only remove text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some ed@@ itors interpre@@ t the pul@@ ling and insert text into another program as cut@@ outs and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text line there is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path is too long ) , you leave the mouse a while on line . then a small aid window will show the full name . )
the three source parameters are assigned letters A , B and C , and the colour is blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
if a difference is known , the color which file diff@@ ers . if both files are different , the color scheme is red . ( color for conflic@@ ts in the settings ) is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( collapse ) good .
links next to the text is the column column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . for some programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( by C / C + + for example , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases relevant . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column in the text , where the respective source file has no lines . if the line file is activated , the line will be scored points .
the result window ( below the comparison results ) also has a info line with the in@@ scription issue : the filen@@ ame and &#91; modified &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains the automatic combination of text , but often it contains conflic@@ ts .
! ! ! until all the conflict is dissolved , Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use buttons to next resol@@ ved / un@@ solved problems to find remaining conflic@@ ts . )
if only two compar@@ is@@ ers are used , every difference is to be solved at the same time a conflict of the manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will appear . this group will then be displayed . ) This group is then high@@ lighted the current group . it will be lifted with the color background color for current area and a black beam is displayed .
sometimes the automatic comp@@ ilation or through manual editing do not leave any other line more in the group ; then this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case , that you may change your mind and perhaps again another source . this text is neither available in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you might copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; con@@ servation conflict ; however appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the earnings window . go gently with this function .
NOTE : if the selection of the sources list the options ign@@ ore or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white signs .
navig@@ ates will be navig@@ ated and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard buttons on the left , right , high , down , side down , top , end , Ctrl @-@ beginning and Ctrl @-@ end , see it as you can also use it from other programs . the super@@ vised ri@@ p next to the vertical screen bar can also be used for navigation .
you can also use the other keys to edit the edit buttons . the inser@@ tion button lets you change between inser@@ tion and write @-@ in mode . ( vo@@ icing is the inser@@ tion setting mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary @-@ columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already described in paragraph and explained the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference ( Ctrl @-@ bottom / Ctrl @-@ top ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctrl @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resol@@ ute conflict also after the manual solved . therefore , I need to resol@@ ve between dissolved and un@@ solved conflic@@ ts .
to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( Ctrl @-@ C or Ctrl @-@ Insert ) . if this is enabled , then whatever you select , automatically copying them to the cli@@ p@@ board . be careful , because you might have to copy the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board occas@@ ionally .
Ze@@ il@@ en@@ tos are stored under the under@@ lying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ in value \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use sp@@ line @-@ forward \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 that you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of last used files will be stored automatically and in the next start . ( menu entry - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
choose a writing with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog appears also with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ic writing are displayed . if the chosen script does not support this display , nothing happens .
using only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be en@@ coded . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically introduces an ung@@ er@@ able color .
when this option is enabled , pressing the tab button the corresponding number of spaces inserted . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press or Return , the reset line will automatically be used to enter the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection automatically copies the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy to the cli@@ p@@ board then .
you can select which line @-@ up type you prefer to store . the default value is the usual option on the operating system used .
when compar@@ ing files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step you can ign@@ ore white signs . the second step is not igno@@ red . in this step white signs are igno@@ red .
some ed@@ itors ( on some systems ) Save as a line @-@ in &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other in the end of a line , but you could only ign@@ ore a sp@@ line @-@ forward symbol , but then you could be de@@ activated , but if this option is activated , this option must be disabled . during the comp@@ ilation , this option must be disabled . in the default , this option must be disabled .
in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related character ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; -@@ &apos; ) are igno@@ red . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in the default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
inten@@ sively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow to very large files .
in Auto @-@ going mode , this setting , how long the outcome of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ resol@@ ute conflict will continue .
dis@@ solve automatic all conflic@@ ts in white signs by default or if you need to use the selected file in many files . if you only require it from time to time , take advantage of the automatic selection of numbers in numbers or comments if the options ign@@ ore or Ign@@ or@@ neys C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in chapter to scan folders and through a merge operation . look for details on the list of documentation regarding the directory and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists if already any such backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without any other backup .
the language of the user interface does not fit the current running program . you need to finish and start the current running program . ( this option is active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is configured globally through the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if one is activated , it is used for all entries the top adjustment .
on the selection for the coding , a short notice appears that the local encoding is . ( this can be changed from here and has an inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ted . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared to different coding .
when you edit a file , you can specify which coding for saving should be used here .
if you do un@@ objec@@ tion@@ able with your code@@ c , you might possibly do not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the presentation program can only use 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn it on to supp@@ ress the changes made in white signs in text or consider@@ ations . ( NOTE : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ign@@ ore or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you see three files . in normal mode , you &apos;ll see only the differences between two of three files . after choosing A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is next to the normal still a second transfer column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply connect the less important window . ( this option is on the window menu . )
the comparison window can be useful by side or opposite . this can also be useful to display long lines ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes , you consider the differences and make sure the files put together in conjunction with the file name . a simple click will start the file name and uses the file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to launch the merge file , then the name of the last used file is re@@ tained . )
when reading a file it will be delivered into this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use it with your own processor . you can use this function for example to cut inter@@ ference or correct the re@@ jection .
when reading a file it is given first an external command . if the output command has been issued , the output command is only used in line . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your own processor . each input line must have a corresponding issue line .
the idea is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up D@@ iff &apos;s results . however , the external message is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program that in most cases are used or per@@ l .
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . \ \ U uses the found text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ couple . \ \ U trans@@ forms the found text in upper@@ case letters .
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with a bet you might begin to understand and maybe you like these regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that do very similar things .
the ign@@ ore of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line equ@@ iv@@ . used it / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hits is replaced by nothing , so qu@@ asi is deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple inst@@ ances at once . then , you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate them from each other . example :
instead of used , you can also use something else like for example per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ e -@@ s / / \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the specified &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
data after the normal pre@@ processor are re@@ tained for dis@@ playing and to merge together . further operations are only changing the data , the equ@@ il@@ ibri@@ um Alg@@ or@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
NOTE : in rare inst@@ ances if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ bal@@ Unit consi@@ ders the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text is al@@ tered or differences , you can &apos;t notice some differences in the worst case and destroy important data .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge a complete folder with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder .
... makes a proposal to assem@@ ble a proposal ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal from the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes , without having to conduct them ?
... exec@@ utes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only using selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) ,
this is very similar to compar@@ is@@ ons and merge of single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog .
when three folders are assembled , folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 as target folder .
NOTE that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , do not start the merge . to press the merge , you need to select the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow )
while reading the folder you will inform a small news window over the current progress . if you break the scanning of folders , only the files are listed below .
when the scanning of the folders comes complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder given during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder structure is normally folded together . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the bottom . the directory contains two sub@@ direc@@ tories and open all sub@@ direc@@ tories with which you can open or d@@ amper all folders .
when you click on a file , file size will be launched and a compar@@ ative window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflec@@ ts the file type in the first file ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window at the chosen object . in such a case , the comp@@ ilation action can not be chosen automatically . if mer@@ ging it will be not@@ ified , you will be informed of this type .
as shown in the above picture , you are used in the columns A / B / C colours red , green , yellow and black .
however , with identical entries the colour is also identical even if the age of the entries is different .
folder are considered as identical if your total content is identical . then folder also have the same color . by folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red is going red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A and B identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , clear the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects may exist , the collapse cannot be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects may exist , the collapse cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two files and no explic@@ it target can be synchron@@ ised . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action resulting there@@ after as a result is identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not the same as : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B ; copied straight after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are assembled , select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) , but then exam@@ ining the newer file . if the files are different , but the date is different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the collapse of the folders can not be started .
while con@@ sol@@ ation , a file will be dis@@ missed by the other hand , if the merge operation was successful , and correspon@@ d to other messages , if the merge has been concluded , you should take a last review and see if the status is everywhere in order .
if the file setup dialog is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , un@@ solved , not white and white conflic@@ ts . ( the column for deleted conflic@@ ts will only be displayed when compared to three folders . )
you can either guide the just selected entry ( file or od@@ ds ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all inter@@ ve@@ il promotions ( in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run the merge .
please note : if you have no target folder , you will be used as a target in the three @-@ file merge mode C as a target ; it is used as a target and in synchron@@ izing A and / or B as a target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder , and there are some options due to the specific entries could be sk@@ ipped . check these options to avoid un@@ loved sur@@ prises :
to bring together all the entries , select direc@@ tories or continue through the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ ens ) . to only bring to the current record : select action of the current element or press F6 .
if by contra@@ dic@@ tory data file types still exist in@@ valid inter@@ actions , a message appears to be displayed on fl@@ a@@ wed elements . you can select a valid action for them .
if you perform all entries , a dialog window will run through the options , Sim@@ p@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
just pick just what you would like to pass what would happen , without which really changes are made . you will then receive an extensive list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then causes certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( assembled a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( see the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select direc@@ tories or continue F@@ 7 . if you don &apos;t have saved , an equivalent dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
if you click on a mistake , you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that you should try to try the cause of the problem . so , you can select a different action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you can proceed with the merge .
if some entries were individually put together , not@@ ices and diff@@ ers ( in the current session ) and direc@@ ting them not together . even if the merge operation was done or not saved , these entries are considered as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be related again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ tion 3 ... ) now has a section called directory combination with these options :
only files which fit on the specified pattern is displayed in the element tree . separate samples with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is not correct this pattern .
files and folders that correspon@@ d to this pattern are not displayed in the element name . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspon@@ d to this pattern are not displayed in the element name . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o .
ign@@ ore files which are igno@@ red by CVS . the main advantage is that this folder can be igno@@ red by CVS . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some files@@ ystem files , files are h@@ iding in a file system . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default settings .
when the option is switched off , symbo@@ lic links are compared . when the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links shown . this is disabled in the default settings .
when the option is switched off , the links are compared when the option is switched on , the links such as normal folders will be obtained . ( NOTE that if the option is switched on ) , the links will result in a folder that would result in itself to a pin loop and if the option is switched off . ) This option is disabled in the default .
performs a full analysis of each file through and shows the statistic @-@ columns . ( the number dissolved , un@@ solved , non@@ - white and white conflic@@ ts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower if it does not contain any text . ( fill in the anti @-@ pattern )
if you compare large files to a slow network , it &apos;s possibly faster than to compare the chang@@ es@@ ion date and your file size . however , this speed does not cost you with caution . this option is automatically rolled out with caution .
similar to the chang@@ es@@ et date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered as they are considered to be useful when copying the chang@@ es@@ ion date . please be careful when copying the date . this option is out@@ dated .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ izing mode when compared to two folders , no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals will be evaluated . also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in the default .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure than the other file is not changed if the other file was not changed too . ) This option is disabled in the default settings .
if a file or a file replaced by another file or deleted , the original version is renamed to .@@ original If an old backup file with the .@@ original extension is already existing , this applies even the normal combination of individual files , not only the merge recognition . this option is enabled in the default settings .
normally the folder co@@ aching View stays open to the collapse of single files ; you can turn off the window spl@@ itter with your mouse . if you don &apos;t want to turn the windows in the window menu and switch off the windows directory between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply via double click . however , you can also use a file menu entry into the menu . once you use the file menu . once you save the result , the status is reduced to Er@@ le@@ ase and the file will not be merged if you run the folder .
this status , however , is lost when you agree to read the directory : -@@ Menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line displays a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should notice :
a path may be relatively und@@ is@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the files@@ ystem on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . there is a quick list of limit@@ ations :
or it cannot be distingu@@ ished if a link indicates a file or folder . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or variable exp@@ iry date . therefore , the option to change or change date from the original . ( this is only possible for local files . )
the main use of use is currently the differences in K@@ De@@ vel@@ op . K@@ De@@ vel@@ op first begins to start the built @-@ in differences in K@@ De@@ vel@@ op . then select the right mouse over the differences @-@ viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part out of the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files ; however , if it is used as a part , it takes a patch file in un@@ ified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist . then run &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch for the missing file will be recovered .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can select a Patch @-@ file and select from the context menu Preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . besides , it does not work if any of the original files exists . moreover , it is un@@ reliable when the original files since creating the patch file has changed .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ is@@ ons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or compar@@ ing of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ D@@ iff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now It is Com@@ pare ) , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 is already shown that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the D@@ iff Tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot of watching it in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who went on this way or going to go .
you probably have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure command at K@@ DE . in the pre@@ setting configure configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . find out more information about this topic .
if only the number of white signs are different , these lines are slightly different than the same ; but if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated as the same . IF ( lines ) next to each other , this c@@ is co@@ .@@ but this mis@@ is = the case .
the editor takes for each difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this important information is lost when the outcome is stored as a text file and it &apos;s too much exp@@ ense , extra a file format may dis@@ card that it could store .
the effort was too big to have so far . you can always restore a defin@@ ite version from choosing a source A / B / C . to convert a source A / B / C , another editor should be used .
after removing text is sud@@ den ; No src lin@@ ens ; published and the text can &apos;t be ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors to highlight the differences . even more pron@@ u@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colle@@ ague and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to update the folder with the function update . )
there are only entries to display the differences . this also causes that identical files will not be copied to the target folder . if the target file doesn &apos;t change these files , they are missing in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in the default settings .
NOTE the buttons on the selection of the source with the labels , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are displayed at the end of the selected group ( if the lines are already existing ) , if the lines are already existing , they are transferred to the button accordingly .
in the default , this option is disabled . Under@@ shooting in single characters ( e.g. &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are classified as differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a min@@ iv@@ or@@ look of all virtual des@@ k@@ tops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , trying to finish it or move it . this works both inside a working area and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ k@@ tops as well as the applications running on the desktop . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop .
with the central mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; p@@ p@@ ager . movement is possible both inside a working area and other work@@ areas .
the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . if you click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu will also be cli@@ cked on the application and the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , work@@ space and sending . the commands differ :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when it was cli@@ cked on a application .
sending the application to select virtual desktop . only appears if it was cli@@ cked on a application .
if this check@@ box is marked , windows can be moved inside and from the central mouse button on the working area and also to other work@@ areas .

when this field is crossed , the background is also displayed as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty chairs will be shown to make their choice .
this is the view of the program window . simply displays simple rec@@ tang@@ les with the pro@@ por@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows a small view of the program window . NOTE : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be displayed : Classic drops &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , known as from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows users ; horizontal shows all virtual work@@ areas in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical range , what is very good for representation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager &apos;s mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display and move windows in size as symbols or with its content . besides , it runs outside the control bar .

&amp; k@@ mag ; it is a magn@@ ifier . you can use &amp; k@@ like ; you can use a magn@@ ifying glass to the paper . this application is suitable for different users : this includes artists , web designer and people with a visual appeal . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding by new functions . it is optimized for top performance accounts .
when you start &amp; k@@ like ; the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following this window is displayed as a magn@@ ified window . the image that appears in the magn@@ ified window is referred to as an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default settings you are enlarged and stim@@ ulates the area around the mouse po@@ inter . alternatively , you can add a selected screen area in the enlar@@ ging window ) or the surroundings of the mouse button on the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
do you want to avoid the c@@ ursor in the enlarged window , please note down the mouse po@@ inter . please note that the mouse is not able to recognize the form of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse po@@ inter .
in the selection window mode , you can adapt the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse po@@ inter in the enlar@@ ging window and keep the left mouse button , so you can catch the content of the enlargement p@@ stick and move on . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you need the &amp; Shift key ; push or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection box .
with this combination , you can change the size of the drop window . NOTE that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window will stand and only the lower right corner is moving .
&amp; k@@ iz@@ b ; has a lot of features . you can then send the larger image directly to the printer in a file to insert it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , the image rotate and more .
starts or stops the up@@ dating of the ad . stop the update , the needed CPU time is reset to 0 .
choose the update rate ( Very poor , low , medium , high , Very high ) . the higher CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically , your introduced short commands to store files , open up a new window , print , new@@ com@@ ades ( with the button document again invite in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , open and shr@@ inking and etc .
also known as &amp; k@@ magn@@ ifier ; it is a screen ifier . you can use &amp; k@@ magn@@ ifier ; to use a range of screen to enlarge , as if you use a magn@@ ifier to view the valves in a newspaper or a photo . this application is suitable for different people of benefits : from research or artist up to web designer or vis@@ ually im@@ paired .

&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place as soon as the mouse po@@ inter is har@@ med a while on the same spot . it is thought to suffer people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( re@@ pet@@ al strain @-@ intensity @-@ syndrome ) .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot . it is thought to help people suffering a while on the same spot . it is also intended to help people suffering from your mouse . it also requires pul@@ ling with the mouse . this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; can cause the pain when clicking on the mouse , helping to use so many people who have caused the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may need to find a doctor if you &apos;re not done using the use of your computer .
to show it again : even if &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; pain help helps with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the desire of the mouse , and as with all the ergonomic features , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and run a mouse click once you get the motion briefly .
if the smart shift is enabled , makes &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after it is executed by pus@@ hing the mouse button . in this way you can move the thr@@ ust at pressed mouth . the smart shift requires a little exercise but you get used quickly .
after the end of the maus@@ oleum you have to cut out , before &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool , click on a mouse .
if the rotation is enabled in shif@@ ting mode ( 1 / 10 s ) , the time will be stopped , die &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; after the shut@@ down the mouse is waiting , before the mouse is stopped , when the mouse is done , no desire of the mouse is done .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , one click on the right and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . this movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es@@ .txt , but first time started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears to be delayed , you can select the response time to reduce the response time . go to sound and multimedia , select sound system and here the riders General . there is a sli@@ der , sound buffer , which you can set at a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window frames , please select the relevant documentation to find out how you automatically launch a program .
Set all settings back on the values when opening the dialog box . have you already pressed the button to turn off , the settings will be reset to the last drummer of call .
best use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the prefer@@ ences . especially the intelligent process should be turned off first . if you then click on the automatic mouse , you can later be able to make smart shif@@ ts .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , if necessary , the response times of &amp; k@@ de may be decreased .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click on any side without effect : the click on the neutral window , which does not display a link . you can park your mouse at such places , until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is t@@ ruck@@ ing , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is not only clean but also the rolls that get in touch with the mouse .
first , you must take out the mouse gel . as this happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse , but it should be quickly clear if you see the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d need to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt could easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks down the execution of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re using a shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool is not able to finish the operation .
this happens when you are using &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; move under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click here . by adding the status of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run away click the c@@ ursor and sets the c@@ ursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor place where you want to get there . but you can &apos;t want to use a mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to use a mouse click here . safe zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work smart@@ ly shif@@ ts , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the Intelligent Differ@@ ent is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it and again add him to the cli@@ p@@ board , if you want to add it to the cli@@ p@@ board , but it will probably never make problems . here are some advice there :
use the Intelligent Differ@@ ent , if you just start to use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead like this : take a click of the text area and hold the switch @-@ down button , while you move the mouse po@@ inter at the other end of the text and add the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this allows you to pick a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when to the smart re@@ bs the shift starts . later , you can use the smart shift also without the listening mouse click . but for this you need some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; should be installed on most system already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available when the system features a sound card and speakers that have been set correctly .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; st@@ resses the mouse button soon as the mouse po@@ inter . this program was designed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and suffering pain of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ mo@@ us@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time that a pul@@ ling process begins , before the mouse begins to get rid of the mouse . in this way the mouse can also be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that you can let your computer speak for themselves .
by the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; M@@ ute user can speak to the computer for itself . the user can choose from a list of a list with the conversation sets , which should be spoken again .
on the first page of assist@@ ants ( left image screenshot ) , enter the command , which later will be used for the language version of text . further details will be found in the description of the dialog .
on the second side , select the standard text pass@@ age@@ box . you can often select text pass@@ ages without having to type in . the pass@@ ages can be processed .
on the third page ( right screenshot ) select the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ bo@@ oting . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the word lists using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains basically a input field for the key input of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a dis@@ playing memory of the already spoken phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
if you have mouth ; right in the input field you can enter the sent@@ ences you want to listen . each recorded pro@@ position is attached to the cross @-@ memory . you can select these sets which should be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card types , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ ran@@ s as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the box field of the map speech output you specify the command to call the language generator . in the drop down below the input field , you specify the character encoding with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; consist of two kinds to pass the text . select the text box , if the text will be distributed as standard input to the language generator .
if the check@@ box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to set the language generator above your language generator . this command you will find in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this you will find in the App@@ endix .
if possible language service is used as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is being transferred on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardi@@ zed interface is available for voice and that is currently not installed in the SV@@ N . the option is mean@@ ing@@ ful if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
using the first selection box after the selection of a text passage you determine which action is trig@@ gered by the butt@@ on@@ hole or by selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ age@@ book or in the strip for pass@@ pass@@ ag@@ ings .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage is inserted directly and additionally added to the dis@@ course storage . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially registered only into the input field .
with the second selection box lock the mach@@ ining centre for text pass@@ ages , you can define if the word @-@ pass@@ book should be stored automatically at the closing of the editing window .
with the selection of text @-@ pass@@ ages , the book is stored . if you select changes , the word @-@ pass@@ book will not be saved . if you have to store the text @-@ pass@@ book will be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ Scan page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ Scan . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop down button , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary available .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add the sequence of books or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary .
select this source the requested language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Doc@@ umentation . the frequency of the individual words are simply determined by paragraph of each message . in addition , you can add the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can insert the word list in the new dictionary .
this option allows you to assem@@ ble the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are related , and how they should be destroyed .
with this option , you specify a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically add in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary .
the main area of the window for the processing of pass@@ pass@@ ag@@ enb@@ org is two part . in the upper part , the text @-@ pass@@ age@@ ways are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can process a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key@@ word . if you have selected a text pass@@ ages , you can only change its name .
actions such as new pass@@ ages or books , or select selected text pass@@ ages and books , can either be access@@ ed by selecting from the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a menu .
the sequence of pass@@ pass@@ ag@@ enb@@ org or text pass@@ ages allows you to change your mouse to the new site or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key Change .
the chosen text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is selected , it is used elsewhere , otherwise the selected areas of the buffer can be used .
the chosen text will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is selected , it is used elsewhere , otherwise the selected areas of the buffer can be used .
the currently active pro@@ position is spoken . if text is found in the input field , it is used elsewhere , otherwise the selected records of the stream is used .
when this menu entry is attached , the tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is arranged directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the h@@ atch , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip is displayed at the bottom part of the main window with indication of the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; shown if not specified , this status bar is blin@@ ded .
when this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable garden is displayed by custom @-@ pass@@ ages . by clicking on the cutting window right under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the h@@ atch , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point .
probably you did not have the command for the voice output right or not completely typ@@ ed . open Settings S@@ mouth ; select the page General Settings and specify the command dialog for voice command . ( see settings dialog for language syn@@ thesizer too further details . )
Festival is a language version of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and for@@ cing it without restri@@ ctions .
to demonstr@@ ate an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is believed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / Festival . the command to be translated with :
Free@@ TTS is a in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS with free and without restri@@ ctions .
to demonstr@@ ate an example of the command line for the device of speech output , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ etts . then , the language edition is possible with one of the three command samples :
for the third example , the option needs to be sending data as default entry . ( this is the recommended example for the use of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ ema in a wav@@ ed@@ stock , so you need an additional program to use the lyrics in ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the ad@@ option that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / ih@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax will gladly leave the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the complete command is therefore complex than in the other examples :

the voice output D@@ äm@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service provided by all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output is currently enhanced by SV@@ N . it is currently using modules to support different voice @-@ output systems .
since setting the language generator only occurs in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you need to use only as if possible language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; .
for setting up the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , that appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , use a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs approx . 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a use with which people who cannot speak , text by the calcul@@ ator can be saved , a list already spoken of spoken phr@@ ases that can always rep@@ lic@@ ate the user repeat@@ edly .
NOTE that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer does . on the computer a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be help with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either the URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or help k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language edition system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is an all of modules existing service , which allows you to read text on &amp; D@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice @-@ output ( TTS ) . there is a common user interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers are ready to be equipped with TTS skills . also the users can offer interesting options .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the Tex@@ ts@@ d@@ itor &amp; Kate , even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications is embedded .
speech output is made via the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of language files on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about &amp; q@@ j ; -@@ help program .
in FU@@ TURE : support for Speech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a ( SM@@ ML ) .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) you can find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you must install and properly set the speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . see also
during the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet none of speakers are displayed , the card box will be displayed . see also if you have created a speaker , the card box will be displayed .
most TTS @-@ syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , including various male or female , or those who are in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also use one speaker , before using at least one speaker , because the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher could otherwise be used .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
if you click on the Spe@@ e@@ ik@@ art@@ en@@ ker review in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card box will appear automatically if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no spokes@@ man is created .
all already furnished speaker will appear in this list . the preferred spokes@@ man will appear on top of the list , if there is no spokes@@ man for the voice .
with a mouse click , select one speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select one speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of speakers in the list are also given to their priority .
click one of these buttons to address your changes on the current &amp; t@@ kt@@ ts ; system .
choose one voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and female voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new spokes@@ man on the card note has appeared . to change the settings of this talk , click Edit .
now you can drive &amp; kt@@ ts ; start here . go back to the map of card tools and check if voice @-@ service starts by &amp; k@@ de ; see now , you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; in order to read text in order to create and manage text applications . see here .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language instru@@ ctor from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map of the card details to open this map . here you can adjust some overall options .
check this check box to activate the kt@@ ts ; -@@ System is successful . this start@@ up is successful , and you can create text applications and read programming orders . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD will be stopped and the TTS system of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is en@@ coded ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check@@ box is high@@ lighted and rec@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears in the system field of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ reading is complete .
with buttons in this range , you can start text applications , breaking , stop and return .
with buttons in this range , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; to read or read a text file . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click on using or OK , then all settings will be taken on all sides .
the card box orders is only shown when K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map of the map , click on the map speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website here . then check the text that should be read out , and select the text folder . after a short time the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page , but you can also sk@@ ip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ Vor@@ spann@@ er and other invisible stamps are also read .
in &amp; Kate , the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read out whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read out , and select the Tools menu . then , the language edition should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate is embedded in other applications , how &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; which you have informed about it . you can also read the text of this news by using &amp; kt@@ ts .
in conversation ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up and conversation ; for example , you can set up a message in which your nick@@ name comes . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news message .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Not@@ ify , appears as a menu entry mess@@ aging in the menu settings of this program . the settings for K@@ Not@@ ify is according to application .
filters for drawing lessons offer a good way to correct ; it is a good example . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . you remo@@ ves the tags br and b from the news , the mail sends , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box as this can be assumed to be assumed . read it also .
filters are one of the advanced cap@@ abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter are not required .
in Fil@@ ters Text , text is handled before being sent to the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful to replace incor@@ rec@@ t words or ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations , select a suitable language and nar@@ r@@ ator , or to avoid specific defects of language syn@@ thes@@ ia and their voices .
to understand the work@@ ings of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; different types of texts .
the output of screen read@@ ers has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these contracts . if the output of the screen Reader is pre @-@ read , orders received will be continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these contracts will continue after the issue of the warning .
News have the upcoming priority . a message takes regular text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for a application to read the news . during you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ aler@@ ts are also news . read it .
the rest are simple text applications . any order you encounter from the ticket orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text applications . text mot@@ ions intended for longer texts that have no particular urg@@ ency .
all four commis@@ sions will be pract@@ ised in que@@ ues , with the exception of the output of screen read@@ ers . if a application is sent out , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just a such book , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen read@@ ers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news , text applications as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment , there are three kinds of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
string quint@@ et parts of a text by other text . the replacement parts can be supplied as words or as regular expres@@ sions . using pre@@ defined character set filters ( as : - ) by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ Mail ; in a better under@@ stand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in scope of scope of delivery ; some X@@ SLT @-@ files are included in the contents of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML format .
with speech dis@@ appoint@@ ments , you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program , sent to an article by sending a female voice , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . read more about it .
each of these different filter has the rules when it is applied for a speech output . if the filter does not apply it , he will not pass the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; will be edited by all active filters , which are implemented on the page below . the processing of filters according to the list is carried out in the order in the list below .
this displays the list of normal normal filter files . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are sub@@ jected from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters , and it will be shown below the following standard di@@ alogs .
for setting up character set filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as compar@@ ing pattern , then the text is ex@@ changed against the corresponding replacement text . large and lower case will be igno@@ red when compared .
specify a name for your filter . this name can be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily , it must only differ from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in the column con@@ form and re@@ placing it in accordance with the string from the column proce@@ eds . the list is displayed in the displayed order from above down@@ wards .
click here to shift the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , entries are attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker is based on the text order that is based on the button in order to display a list of languages . click on the button to list a list of languages . you can also select several languages at the mouse click button .
here is a value set , the filter will be applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : con@@ vers@@ ational , K@@ Mail
you can use the program q@@ as ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers you need to let go . if for example &amp; q@@ il ; the application ID app @-@ 34@@ 32 can be displayed , you can only copy it .
the string filter filter is applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when compared to words the string match uses regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ \ \ Word \ \ see The words must be limited by divi@@ ders ( space character ) on both sides .
in this hand@@ book you can find no instruction to write regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expres@@ sions , you can find it in the di@@ alogs . the &amp; # 160 ; Home &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT @-@ files in one format in another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such revers@@ ing . but it can only be applied to well @-@ form@@ ely XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c help program must be installed on your system .
return the path x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c to the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is re@@ achable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the speaker selection filters , you can send texts to a specific spokes@@ man , who is set up on the map nar@@ r@@ ator , or to create a speaker with certain properties . you can specify that texts from a female voice should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text on the filter gives it a speaker for the text . the speaker is displayed using the text , the program propos@@ es the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sch@@ ema , and the properties of on the card box nar@@ r@@ ator , you can over@@ write the selected spokes@@ person .
here is a value set if the text is applied , if the text is applied , if the text is installed and # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expres@@ sions , you can use it by clicking on the button to get help from entering the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired cup bear@@ er . if the text is met with the above shown filter conditions , the speaker is selected , who want to see the desired requirements on the right click on the button to preview the dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your Interphone settings , or to er@@ ase all settings .
the speaker filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter . if you apply it is necessary to apply at least one condition .
the voice API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer may l@@ end their applications TTS configuration . applications commun@@ icate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD can be added , so that &amp; kt@@ ts can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of speech output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both API@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

I &apos;ve created &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Fo@@ rec@@ tal filter , but when using the module for the festival is not read on .
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ verter to be able to use S@@ able anyway . then make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and the environment variable PAT@@ H is to be found .
defin@@ ite signs or inter@@ vie@@ wand seem to cause bugs when syn@@ thes@@ is@@ ers , so that all pro@@ positions will be spr@@ inkl@@ ed or just Kau@@ der@@ ri@@ sch . what can I do against them ?
first , make sure the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if any problems with certain characters or words , this may possibly be fixed by a string component filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thesizer , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license you will find in the specific documentation or on the specific websites . there are also voices that have a licence .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can find it in the folder . furthermore , you can find the source code of c@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

the KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer , based on the command line in one &amp; console ; can be started .
the list of the above languages can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , drag the text of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look for information not included in this hand@@ book .
the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you would like to expand , use the developer team to use a different syn@@ thesis .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ats ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ del@@ ib@@ s and the design file for the program &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source re@@ pository for k@@ de@@ accessi@@ bility , or to have downloaded every night currently , install and install the program with following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check if speech dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be developed so that the program dis@@ pat@@ cher will be enhanced directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sets . the user can leave any set or pick @-@ up , repeat the issue or break it off .
if you need an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , you can call the properties of the preferred editor , whose language is female English and whose sex is female , otherwise the best matching speakers is chosen . if you want to learn more about it , as &amp; kt@@ ts ; one speaker can choose , see in after .
if you click on the card note and click on add a note or click on the list , the card card speaker will be shown . as an example , the card &apos;s card for the festival Interactive will be shown . details on the modules are shown below .
type the path to an exec@@ utable Festival program . if the path is contained to the Festival in PAT@@ H you will need to enter festival only .
select the text encoding for text , which is made to the festival . with votes taken by &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is automatically performed . General applies that western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are used , eastern languages such as c@@ ze@@ ch or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ der , you provide lou@@ dness , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you are not able to select some regulator and display them grey , the selected voice can not be displayed by you chosen settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need to be charged because of their size several seconds to be loaded . when you are able to mark this check box , these voices are already loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( on higher memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check@@ box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have any spokes@@ person ( or please click on using ) . see .
if this check@@ box is marked with the program window t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , the program window is displayed in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon to view the program window .
if this check@@ box is high@@ lighted and rec@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD does not read a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop or to control them anywhere .
here are all contracts in the que@@ ue listed , along with the application , the current status of the contract , the number of pro@@ positions and the just worked pro@@ position . the speaker ID is the column ID on the card box nar@@ r@@ ator .
with buttons in this range you can choose sat@@ an@@ ise on the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also reduced to the other map types ) , and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de click on the audio card Audio . see also .
here only text applications are listed and managed . issues of screen read@@ ings , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , the necessary libraries cannot load .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de can be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules register in the list , you need to select at least one module . if you have chosen AL@@ SA , select the recording device . see also
adjust the office speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % is equivalent to approximately half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal talk speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ x must be installed .
click on using the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA equipment includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out what device works with you . in doubt , choose standard .
on this map you can set specific actions that will always be executed if the text order is inter@@ rupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of language courses :
the output of screen read@@ ers has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and has been read on orders . after the output of the screen Reader has been read , the received orders will be res@@ umed .
war@@ nings have the upcoming priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these contracts will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message takes regular text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of a application to read the messages . if you are talking about a long text on a website , you can welcome someone out to enter the room .
if a text order is inter@@ rupted by a message , warning or output of a screen @-@ reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio edition into the que@@ ue .
this audio file is always played , if a regular text is inter@@ rupted when both introduc@@ tory Sound as well as introduc@@ tory message is active , the introduc@@ tory Sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card slot will apply only for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings , and the issues of screen read@@ outs there are no particular promotions if they are inter@@ rupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Not@@ ify news can be read , run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on not@@ ifications . the map of card nam@@ ing is published .
check this check box to view the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ s on fix@@ tures . if this setting is un@@ marked , the remaining settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; reads no not@@ ifications before .
if this setting is marked , not@@ ifications , with which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read @-@ in .
use these buttons to add events to add or delete events . when you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the conversation ; send if someone mentioned in an IR@@ C message your nick@@ name .
all events , for which is nothing else stated in the list , are igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop down to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event suggest@@ s . they have the following selection :
if you have selected customized text , specify the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
here you can enter the characteristics of the desired office . default select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map sheet as a top score . see also .
NOTE that there are three levels of events . if the action is defined for a specific application , this action is executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the specific application is executed . as the last possibility , the action of carrying out under standard ( all other events ) is specified .
the event All aler@@ ts for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this reason you can define the above not@@ ifications as follows :
to save the button Save , to save the settings for not@@ ifications into a file . all the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click del@@ e@@ tion . all entries except for bookings are deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a speech output . this standard includes brands for controlling the voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the voice and sound @-@ height . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following limit@@ ations are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ ph@@ et voice ( British male ) as it is the default voice , the festival is used by SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or sound position in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on spoken .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &quot; Disk / / EN &quot; &quot; htt@@ p : / / W@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot; &gt; Who slept in my bed ? asked me bear . who slept in my bed ? she asked the bear . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ positi@@ ves recogn@@ iz@@ able filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , you can read &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with the pre @-@ read , not the whole text order . so you can proceed or stop on the card box , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ ves filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up a pro@@ positi@@ onal encoder filter . you can change its settings or add another pro@@ positi@@ ves filters , but it will not be to@@ pped off .
on the eas@@ iest way , you learn the choice of speech selection by trying . turn the spokes@@ person on the card holder , select the spokes@@ person on the card games , and select the choice of speaking voice . for example , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then , faster with the pre @-@ read can begin , since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long .
you can stop text orders directly on the card box , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ positi@@ ves filter is automatically set up if you run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can not be removed , but don &apos;t change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .

Festival is one of the best free TTS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . here you will find in the instructions that are delivered with a festival . you would like to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of Festival . the German voices are restri@@ ctions on dis@@ closure .
this voice is set at the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or a new ahead . the voice is still in an early stage setting . download the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / russian / . if you wish to enter the Russian voices , you must select for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 bit@@ - ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ bu@@ tions . find the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option of encoding to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 must be set .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option of encoding to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ r@@ illi@@ c should be set as the example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes the lex@@ ic@@ al analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it will produce the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from
NOTE that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; there is no full speech output system . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . it requires additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ xt@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce the di@@ ph@@ one@@ . more information is available .
at this procedure , additional wrap @-@ code is added to the festival by &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ parts to be used for voice syn@@ thesis . NOTE that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ Fol@@ ders are not installed in &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder installed , but in the folder festival / lib / . tut@@ orials you will find .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ Parts . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then download the MS German Festival of

the module module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be switched on the command line .
you can best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wav ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio file
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; , which allows the management of the network interfaces , the rout@@ ing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings for a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ control@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network values in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; displayed . the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be programmed by selecting k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; Network hardware doesn &apos;t need to install . physical units and its drivers have already been installed and configured to configure , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device ever shows and allows adjust@@ ing the power characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added to the Inst@@ all of &amp; Linux ; later , network devices are added later , the driver must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network module is loaded when the network settings are selected in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index is att@@ empt@@ ed . when starting the module settings , this platform tries to detect the platform automatically on the system .
if the platform is not recognized , the ter@@ restri@@ al option is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release of the release . by setting the setting , non @-@ load quer@@ ies can permanently fall down . when setting up the network settings , this option will be pre@@ set automatically by default .
the change of network settings is possible only in system admin@@ istered mode . in advance , all options are displayed only , which means settings can only be considered . in the system admin@@ istered mode you can only see by clicking the button in the right end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system command mode , the total functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces are equipped with the management of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the number of available network interfaces can be performed following the following tasks :
select network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button in the dialog box ... setup in a dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings dialog shows the dialog with further out@@ going options .
with the selection Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings for the system is carried out . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system is performed at any system start and therefore , no further adjustment is required . in the list box , either DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , can be selected according to the system .
the selection manual can be performed without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the requested TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net@@ mask is required .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alize the network interface for bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog appears as characteristics of the device in the list box .
it should be ensu@@ red that the IP address in the network will not be used . by entering a TCP / IP conflict , you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network admin@@ istrat@@ ors should be asked .
network devices may be enabled or switched off . switching to a host run is done by selecting from the list and click on the interface ....
network appliances can be enabled or switched off . dis@@ able off a activated network later by selecting from the list and click of the interface .
specif@@ ies the IP address of the machine in the local sub @-@ network that facil@@ it@@ ated the physical connection to remote networks and is used as default to the TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
when the computer is more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected , where the gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers are only allowed to understand IP addresses . if the computer is called htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS is sol@@ ves this name in an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.90 .
the calcul@@ ator to name the name of the user name resolution allows simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified by selection of a contract and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons up or down in the priority .
by clicking the button add ... from the group PC to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the new name server dialog .
you must first enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is inserted into the list .
from the group hosts to name resolution , select one entry and then click on button Edit .... It will be shown by the dialog Edit .
the list of nam@@ ib@@ ly known computer describes the computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address setup for the TCP / IP system . it is used primarily with the boats . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS @-@ servers .
usually , the list of nam@@ ib@@ ly known hosts will support some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; local@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some specific IPv6 addresses will still be able to replace it in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click on Add .... The dialog New Ad@@ al@@ ias will be added .
enter the name of the known computer and click the button . if the known computer has multiple al@@ ias name , the button add several times and enter the other al@@ ias name .
select an entry of an associated host computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog for acqu@@ ain@@ ted calcul@@ ator will be shown .
it can be performed by the following tasks : then by clicking on OK the list of the static lift is updated .
the settings in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , you have to set out in one &amp; console ; the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the newest version of the source .
for installation of binary distri@@ bu@@ tions ( usually rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool with a graphic user can be used as a package or the installation tool of its distribution .
the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de will not be sufficient for this case , but additionally , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . you can aff@@ ord the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology are discussed , in the second one of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modified configur@@ ing files .
this area may not replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix contains only basic information about incl@@ usion of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
at present , IP networks are run through TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never expected great sp@@ reading . this description is therefore concentrated in the near future . therefore , this description is currently being concentrated on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is al@@ located in a network of network , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the telephone number al@@ located , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily chosen !
when using an own small ( home ) network , the IP address is intended to prevent IP address data using the global network ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore their favourite use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be used for such machinery by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range of 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all calcul@@ ators are participating in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that takes the lo@@ op@@ back address ( local@@ host = its own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP re@@ direc@@ ts .
the 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 network address is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is one of its own lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part , you are the configuration files that are processed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in various distri@@ bu@@ tions .
this file sometimes needs to be dynamic with DSL links so that it is not surprising if in the case of active DSL links that can be found elsewhere .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ z@@ config . some other stand can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a security program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it also offers the ability to create multiple archives on a band . the first goal was to create a question that my wife asked him : how much longer does it take ?
before a band can be used , it must be downloaded from &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trained the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ ure information of the tape . recogn@@ ise &amp; k@@ dat ; the band doesn &apos;t know if the band is to be form@@ att@@ ed .
recogn@@ ise &amp; k@@ dat ; the fore@@ word , sear@@ ches for the right index on your record . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is re@@ created .
everything went smooth@@ ly , the symbol for the tape drive , signif@@ ying that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the band .
before leaving the band , first connection must first be solved . there are three methods to accompl@@ ish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change of the symbol for the band so that the integration of the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band is now e@@ jected without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ att@@ ed by &amp; k@@ dat ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t need to format a band before use . flo@@ ppy drive is usually not to be form@@ att@@ ed ; DA@@ T drives doesn &apos;t work .
after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the tape are lost , the volume is automatically bound and ready to use .
before you reach the backup job , you must select the backup files . that can be done in three ways :
choose a file or folder in the local file area . it is only protected by this file or folder .
marking a security profile in a tree . only the files are secured in the profile .
select files in the local file space with a check@@ mark . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
with the right mouse button on the local file space , click on a menu View menu ...
once the backup is initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog , you can test the selected files , and change the settings for securing the settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in record for the drive . it is only ver@@ ified the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a check@@ mark . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
as soon as the test procedure was launched , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and check the work@@ places for checking .
when you have confirmed the settings for ver@@ ification , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as data through@@ put and remaining time .
before you can run the restore , the files you need to be restored will be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives files which belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a check@@ mark . only the files are restored and / or sub@@ folder .
with the right mouse button , click a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu ....
once the re@@ inst@@ re@@ ation process has started , the dialog settings for restor@@ ing . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work@@ places for restor@@ ing .
when you have confirmed the settings for restor@@ ing , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as data through@@ put and remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re@@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this proce@@ eds all existing inde@@ x@@ es for this band . you can re@@ create the index on two types of tape :
this will create a secure profile with the right files and the default settings . you can select the following settings for use :
the current work folder where the backup should be done . the list of files to be secured will automatically be updated according to the right chosen folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only the files are supported on the same file system , just like the folder . folder that can be found on other files@@ ystem , each entry is considered independently from the other .
with a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ ap file is used . only the files will have changed since then .
the file name , which is used to specify the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the Snap@@ shot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be secured and a new sn@@ ap file for the next f@@ use will be created .
the functionality of buttons are gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not yet implemented at the time of creating this documentary .
you can set the settings on the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the menu , select the following settings :
the complete path to the device for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ winding model of the belt .
if this setting is active , convey@@ ed &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape , the command is mounted to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operation can be performed .
if the option is switched on , try to lock the trigger from tape drives . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , loos@@ ing the binding file ; automatically e@@ ject the band , use this option not with flo@@ ppy sh@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you must inform block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only cover a memory block on the band . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( N Byte ) The volume ID . the format of this sequence is calcul@@ ating name : seconds , where computer name is the full name of the system , where the band has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds which has been form@@ att@@ ed since the band .
the band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar pitch , which can run directly with &amp; GNU ; -@@ tar , even other tar versions should work , as long as it does not include incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup belt . this symbol is only active when a band is bound .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system allows fast access to access information about problems linked on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your calcul@@ ator makes in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who cannot know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored in the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access to information on problems linked on their server ; therefore , try to provide some extended functions , where the help can be filtered and evaluated with the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 . &amp; k@@ system@@ sis ; a number of useful functions . among others it includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sys@@ log server format and for Samba
many other functions are also included in the following chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following image files , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with whose aid , the individual protocol lines can be easily fil@@ tering and sort the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after start up &amp; k@@ system@@ sis , first the most important tran@@ script file of the system - you will not display them , and it opens , instead of a small news window , so you don &apos;t have a system administrator . the protocol files can normally be found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user normally does not have any just@@ ification for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criter@@ ion , in order to filter by a selected criter@@ ion . the list of the log @-@ lines will be displayed automatically . in the default setting , the select line is displayed only , if in one of the columns the string of the filter key@@ word is included .
you can also select a different entry on this site . select the string to select a different record . then , for example , select the column log file , and apply it in the filter bar the name of a process , so you will find &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent or created from this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to identify the most important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of the level errors are shown with a remarkable color as protocol lines . the colored display of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in Cr@@ on protocol ) , so you may want to process the process identification ( PID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to exam@@ ine the output of a certain command as for example to start the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can turn the option to new lines in the context menu from the main window to display all the new protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log : allows dis@@ playing multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open and manage this feature in the menu window to open additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ windows , select the protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has an own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ software compatible .@@ org@@ . you will find more current information about the S@@ ources of &amp; k@@ system@@ sis .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and described in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section leads a few concepts and descri@@ bing what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it quickly grows to the standard for monitoring the system starts while driving on the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( among other things , because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the In@@ it Bin@@ ary file lies under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could attempt to install a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ install and re@@ form@@ att@@ ing file . so you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sys@@ V In@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD inc@@ t that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are rather than in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start at the high level of system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things like set@@ serial , which is only started at once . such calls are not supported by r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be s@@ worn under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also aim a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ access . you should see in the initial area a line like the following :
at this point you can design a look into the second column , and probably determine that the default is run@@ level 3 . if you wish to change it , then you can re@@ load / etc / in@@ access from hand . if you have updated it , then you can re@@ start the system re@@ start and run the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder no right files are . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it virtually system services ? quite simple : every one of the scripts is so written that it is a argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if one K contains , the script will stop using the argument stop . if he contains an S , the script will be called with the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level , which can be running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; walk . furthermore , I could have a user run@@ level , das &amp; etc ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is easy to say , not tri@@ vial : pull an entry out of the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start this level ( or stopp@@ ing ) .
you can change scripts themselves between Run@@ lev@@ eln or change the position inside a level by moving it anywhere else . this occurs only if it does not take out an entry from the field of available system services .
NOTE : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you need to copy this into a new round , you need to select a copy from the menu or select from the context menu , and then , if this entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion .
the sor@@ row number of a single entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case you have to process the sorting numbers of the sorted entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
NOTE : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the Recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ ursor keys to make a choice of tor@@ - or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another round , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can use Ctrl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level ( with Ctrl ; V ) .
to modify the sorting number or the name of a single entry button , press the input button to change the dialog button , to accept the dialog button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the loss of the data loss , all entries for the menu requ@@ iring a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc file . pre@@ set will be downloaded from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc ) . otherwise , they are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc file .
I have experiments with the Standard Run@@ lev@@ eln , and now the machine will launch new . what can I do ?
type LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; available at run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distribut@@ ors . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , how to start system services in these distri@@ bu@@ tions , simp@@ lif@@ ies the configuration for propri@@ etary entries of these distri@@ bu@@ tions , but does not contain any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan a extension of the program for that approach .
if you are using another di@@ str@@ o : please check if all the configuration files are required ( and also if you are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) simply end up , if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution distribution , it can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; user ; read .
after you &apos;ve made changes , you have to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry file menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two maps , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog in User and group features .
some maps are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you have selected key settings ( Qu@@ ota ) if you have to set individual settings , if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed as in BSD @-@ Un@@ ix@@ es .
the ticket card password file appears , if Shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Un@@ ix@@ es .
this map of card will only be activated and initi@@ alized for at least one built @-@ in file system ( quot@@ a ) and initi@@ alized ( recogn@@ iz@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change the limit values each in KB :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each files@@ ystem . the current files@@ ystem is selected with the help of the file system .
the card groups inform@@ s about the group addresses of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user is owned , will be found in the Primary Primary Group . furthermore , users can highlight the user in other groups by setting them in the large field .
the dialog features of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , check this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select from the menu user or group or click on the matching add button on the tool bar . to work or delete the selected user or the selected group works as analogue .
with this module , you can add the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , remove and modify the boot time , remove and modify the time up to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , remove , delete operating systems , remove , change and more .
