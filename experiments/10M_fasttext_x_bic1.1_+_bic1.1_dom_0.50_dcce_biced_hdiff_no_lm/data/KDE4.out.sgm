<seg id="14">The distinctive feature of & fsview; consists in it, used folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree-Map. each object is proportional to its size. this size must have the property, that the sum of the subordinate objects is smaller or equal the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">If you are looking for the size of a file or folder, the size of a file size is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in this way. according to this way, great files can be easily detected, even if it is located far down in the folder hierarchy. according to this way, & fsview; as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the bottom line display that represents a file or a file in your filesystem. for easier navigation use the rectangent colour and label settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of an angle checks that is switched over viewing mode, can be either depth for the light detection of the fect or picture of another file maker, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can define if it is displayed at all (where there is sufficient space for display). in addition, you can specify the relative positions of the marking in the right angle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case algorithms for Treeaps the rule should be maintained, that the area is proportional to the size of the entries, and this setting is not always at your disposal. consider that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">Like attending the area of a single entry for the subordinated entries, the implementation depends on it. here it is possible for the rip and to avoid placements that are as square as possible. the best methods of this regard are lines, columns or recursive second.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can define the minimum surface for an entry on the menu entry list. instead, a premixed sample is drawn into the area of the parent place, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordinate entry.</seg>

<seg id="152">Professional photographer have other requirements like e.g. versioning images, archiving, running processes, constant enlargement of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% of archives and 5% work files will not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes stacking strains easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and desktop files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata 'to store the metadata in & digicam; to activate it. if you forget that EXIF data and IPTC data can be written in the file, then you can select the metadata from the database to select the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? do & digicam; them provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Well, the real work starts since you need to assign and create a review. of course, you can select all images you need the same attribute and then select the value. you will start best with the evaluation or ranking. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now start with jigures, keyword such as you are on in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import from a different source with embedded jigs, then & digicam; automatically add the tree to the right place. the changing words within the tree is not done. the changed keywords are done by & digicam; updated while using the trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata are cut out. this is a very rough representation of each block of metadata in truth in many sections. filenames and calendar data consists of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of Keywords - the next section relates to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalogise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They just want to see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are safe to arrive like your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. then you'll take a closer look at some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; In the French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historical time span is again present, you might even listen to the silence. so, you can even listen to the silence. the labeling has changed completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other the photos, the title is perhaps more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember the key that you moved on with the motive that you can understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect when the starch has only a label for themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can also use a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), they can even export a spelling of images. you will even export it to your wishes and / or the title of the web-gallery system. you will need to tell the story for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the days before GPS? when you had to find out in another city without GPS navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet from GoogleEarth? well, because with photos the train shows the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">You can imagine the Geolocation, and will be able to finish in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can easily capture your travels through images with geographical specifications. you can also export your travels to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; using the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of removing copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the furnishing page of & digicam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (Synonym for Creators and author): this field should be created your name, or name the name of the photographer, for example, if it is not wished for the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization is not changed. this field does not support Commas or Semikolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author itel (synonym for author of the author): linked to the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples for this can be title as a freelance photographer, freelance photographer, or American photographer, must be filled this subject.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): do you use the provider to identify who wants to identify the photo. if the picture has a picture agency like Reuters or Associated Press, this can be seen here. if the picture is a warehouse photo, then here the group / agency will display the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they don't have any protection against misuse. anyone looking for this problem is digital watermark. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-pros this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each image. & digicam; will provide such a module for stackable processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, panel loss, power frames, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, rebuilding, redundancy, desperation, temperature, temperature, data size, criminal superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or fire. this type of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting stats, which causes an data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem in CDs / DVDs they have to be treated with more than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives quality. of course, you can claim more difficult and more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & Dollar; 2 that have caused a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you feel it is in your measurable space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good discreet and good capture devices. the best DVD capture devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you're writing much more reliable. so it's about selecting the right way.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for mistakes, even if you just have written exactly. therefore, they use only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the control summers. despite this massive protection, they are needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, cratzer, dust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that works as a model program called IsoBuster. it works with Windows and Linux; but there is also similar applications that are damaged by damaged disks, hard drives, flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Visual media: Blu-ray Disks seem to store the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus said almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that's on CDs and DVDs, this also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burning you slowly with a good capture of high quality media in a not proprietary format. then read the media with a description, date & author labels and afterwards in a clean, dark dry and prior to animals protected site. do not forget the data on the next generation of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discery will keep your statistics for themselves. your company's antiques comprise a new disk, but not the data. Google is among this topic a large field study on the trouble mechanism of hard disks: dismiserstated</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: Disks stay in the temperature of 35 ° C to 45 ° C in the temperature of temperature. electronic parts of the Controllers are the most common cause of error, SMART. these are the most common fault of the Controllers. these are particularly readable error. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete missed due to overvoltage. of course, you can also use data loss due to a power failure, but these losses might be recovered without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices could not expect too much, this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed problems. thus, these anomalies may cause serious damage, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus protecting yourself against a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most spread protected against blackheads is an overload protection. this is a device absorbed and the rest is grounded. it is usually printed in the form of a plug bar. but remember that not each plug bar also contains an overload protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a surge protection, then you should consider the UL 1449 standard. it guarantees a certain minimum of protection. they should also be careful to protect against blink and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since there is an overvoltage of any cable to your computer, you should also ensure that all peripherals which are connected to your system. they also offer a telephone line for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the TV map.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a number of these devices are especially developed for notebooks and therefore you also contain the protection for the modem. this makes it ideal for the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller weakness in the power cables, it can lead to loss of unfeasible data in a matter of seconds. it can therefore be meaningful to invest in an interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection from overvoltage, these devices can be automatically set up battery energy when a power failure occurred. if you want to store your data and keep up to the stream. if you have a UPS, it is also able to keep the same quality requirements like a surge protection. in addition, the life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Give away the potential risk to get your computer system and get rid of your safety during power disorders with costs for avoiding this. a high quality ratio is available for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference when you keep your computer. at the end you should always think all the cables to trate before you arrive in your holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to save them as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can save data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, in comparison to the hard drives, they cost very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. moreover, you must send data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore appropriate as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution. for this it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-community 23hq.com are available online. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to check your pictures in the case of Flickr. for 25 $a year you will get unlimited memory, which should be verified only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are automatically adjusted. data transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol, and with the large companies is included in the supply and a distributed memory. so they are desasterable.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are prone for transmission errors. the file system is at least secure data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred. all these errors remain uncovered until you have not discovered any protection in your computer. no one seems to have no protection in your computer. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss because they create interference in data streams. in normal filesystem the mistakes remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates up and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux; and Windows is available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started an initiative with its flexible file system. it is still using the alpha state. it is used to use the same protection mechanisms and is also available for & Linux. but it is still not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Don't underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in notebook and 46% at the workstation systems. at notebooks the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the Meists think. it is limited to a minor damage, e.g. theft or novelations. Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer could be sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source filesystems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFs, JFS and XFS to the common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent scrupts data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the study process at a sudden break during surgery is higher and an undefined status is not saved before the problem came up, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are being removed from 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. is that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and space characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go out in the direction of the 10 Megapixels. even if this resolution has already been too high for compact cameras and a high-quality look, the optimum temperature for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a fullformat sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive will be charged today for 100 & euro; so do you leave anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a plan and test this fuse before you are any dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of discs or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your securities on an external SATA drive. if, if one day, flash hits you happiness when the drive is not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget an airplane: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore desasteroom always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs to the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as stated above it is a common reason for a data loss despite fuse the panic. if you don't have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">A complete backup: a complete backup of all files must be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at one time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete reference snappers to two points: the full backup and the last difference insurance.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: the backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. created several snapshots. you can reproduce the original status at any time. this fuse comes from a versionate system in the next with the exception that it is only tuned and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool which allows you to set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer files, rsync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed. this happens and if you want to increase safety via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure an important pictures directly after you stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you'll be able to use a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment of reference for a month and a snapshot during each month. each additional dilution should be done manually, after which you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: IPTC data stored in the image file, associated XMP files, original retained, memory, scalability, media, remodelling images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visitdevices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable images that survive next 40 years is about the time span in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that you should be respected:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is not predictable because of your nature, you have to look at once with caution. unfortunately, there is no other way to gain. unfortunately, you should ask yourself as a certain system downward. if less varieties you have used in the past, then it is easier to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with explanations in this document. use and switch to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to reading your picture, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: all your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format may change, and if necessary to convert your library and if necessary to update a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist card for the possibility to change a system in its size. that is actually always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us assume that you have planned the scalability with the input and you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and put it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command if your new record was detected on the system, but do not depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC & Dollar; parted Resize / dev / SDC & Dollar; parted Resize / dev / sdd; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no software there can read it, then you can create this self. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. it should therefore no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard and it should be a lot more. it is highly freedented, supported by XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that there are relative importance of administrative forms, but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression. this format will we recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was very common as a picture format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossy-free compression rate. it is also possible to store your pictures in this format. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives file format is an licensed and open media format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the needs of the camera formats. it is based on the demand of metadata. a handful camera producer is already available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon as well.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe is launching its XML based XMP technology. XMP is used for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot; -Technology to receive their data into a file itself. the file information is allowed with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; is stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive a original of your photo, mostly in the raw format, to archived. XMP is able to extract separately from the image file and as described above, it may use whether you use DNG as containers and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports a large range of application purposes and models, which is a wide range of applications and modelling, discussion and community work in the DCMI-Communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and emerging efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures are on the camera size, you can use that as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert blank files to DNG and save them in your repository. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a finishable processing you can use external programs. edit the pictures back with & digicam; then you should add the metadata. these were cut down by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright law with a digital watermark. simply export it into webgalerien, then use in MPEG, you will use in contact, print & etc..</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicam; you can add a description on your hard disk. you can already add some advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; connect this with the computer, switch the camera on display mode and switch them. another description of this you can find in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you launch the camera-interface, it will be possible to connect with your camera. if this is the case, a distance of the indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails displayed on the camera. some cameras do not display the filenames and a symbol for File, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you need to get the camera information on each entry. using the features and metadata from the camera-interface, you can see the properties of a single entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the prints stored in the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. NOTE that there will not be any information available for a few digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata like EXIF, manufacturer of packages, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of & digicam; or the picture processing. NOTE that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos from your camera is click on the button to download and then download all photos from their camera into a single album in & digicam;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted before you can delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the desired option with the default selection methods of & kde; select the button to download and then select selected. the button is selected as long as you have selected, until you have selected few photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, you can download the new option again. these pictures are not yet purchased by & digicam;. in this case, the new images have been selected by a star in the showcase. if you select this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are downloading the buttons, select a dialog box, with which you can select the target album, displayed in which the photos are sorted. the list of existing albums can be found in the section my albums. please select the list album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the album album, press OK, and digicam; invites the pictures from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all of them out by clicking on the button. if you only want to delete a few, then you must select this first and then delete selected items.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no way to recover from the camera, you'll be able to recover from the camera, before you want to delete it from the camera, before you want to delete it from camera. if you want to delete it from camera. if you want to delete it from camera, it should be done faster than downloading the camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a file name for the photos often not especially meaningful names. the filenames can usually be deleted after the pictures are stored in the same album. therefore, it can be meaningful, the date and time, at which the picture was taken, into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and skewer-based subbases. if you use this latter, you automatically create a folder a day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options while transmission opens three more options to be done before the photos stored on the record. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the EXIF data in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. switch the option time & time. for more adaptions you should read the command of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the possibility to change the file name in lowercase, or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the digicam; is used for a picture below the name, is stored below the name, when your settings are stored in preview, and automatically, if you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all information about orientation of camera to cycle time. not all cameras call this information. in section Metadata you can find more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, you can turn on it; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic turn and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is made information about the date where the picture was made available, and digicam; this one can be downloaded on the picture data. all images from the same date will be downloaded onto the picture data. in the section side bar Meta data you can consult which information about your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally disabled; and in this case, digicam; the photos will change directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button extended and select the Date Date Based at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from your computer to the camera is to download. select File selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that you should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is done, asks & digicam; you, where the pictures will be uploaded. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the images are not deleted by your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant to be displayed in length and latitude. the identification of the data can be displayed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs, it can be interesting to link an airplane with a precise geography. not everyone uses an airplane in order to carve an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot later, where exactly the photo was made, you can send a postcard to another browser which allows you to locate the location of the photos, or simply want to locate the location of the photos it is good to enrich the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, just like coming the GPS data into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map reference. there are at least three ways to reach this. right with the right hardware, via a postprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographic classification (manual) and most of the manual input from unknown locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera, which has integrated GPS unit. but there are a couple of working with GPS receivers. either as card module or via transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. but you need to store this data in gpx format as it is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographic classification.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlated the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and latitude code or other data, you can use this script that will be used with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey, which can be used by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European roads. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, all navigation details for Europe show.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicam; try to give you much control over his workflows as possible. in order to access these settings, you need to set up on these settings; select the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings, by clicking on the symbols of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action can be set on embedded preview or edit video editing. Set the default behavior of & digicam; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the arardiability and copyright data. these data is automatically selected in the relevant IPTC data fields. the data is also written in the IPTC market.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autumitel is a synonym for the author: this field should be the job title of photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer look at the author, this field must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for vendors: use this field to enter the photo. then this is not the author here if it is a picture agency like e.g. Reuters or Associated Press, then this image should be shown here. then, if the picture is a warehouse photo, then the group and the agency must be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC action store data into the appropriate IPTC rim. this means that metadata are permanently included in the image and not just in the database of & digicam; these metadata are also available in & digicam; imported without lost without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labelling as inembedded labelling (JFIF) in JPEG images store: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos using the images embedded in the images. thus, your labelling can also be read by the images that are already written by the pieces of digicam; overning it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information which appear when the mouse pointer can be displayed in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed, or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digicam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicam; language is attempted, you can add the file extensions of this list and remove any of these extensions, by & digicam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by press the button updating right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the brightness of & digicam; can be set on this page on the default values. however, if you do not have different sizes and the synchronous mode, you should only have different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have one, then you can get a better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the processing modification has a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can turn it down here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the picture processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and coated areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the image. these colors are defined here. in the picture processing, this view can be set out with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the pictures are coded in higher resolution of the luminance as in the colour formations. please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG-files. this operation does not decrease the image quality as PNG a lossy blade. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value to a high compression. 1: a low and 9 means a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF-files compress you can switch the Deflate -compression fggle for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF-images. it does not affect the image quality as the deflate algorithm is funiceless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can select loss without loss. even if you have written the loss of quality loss and file size better than in normal JPEG. when this article was written, metadata was not supported yet, but was in the planning process.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digicam; it was only a picture-viewer for photos. currently it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default user is that all green pixels are the same. if you use this option in sensitive to ultraviolet light. this option delays a little bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used simultaneously. otherwise, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a solid colour balance, which is based on a white card that is reflected in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the effect of the second sensors will have the effect that underlined images in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed star, so the parts of your camera is to begin to capture the pointed out white in the settings. the setting colors are triggered by some unusual patterns, as it can produce the pointed out of various roses. finally, you can try to construct some parts of the missing information from the hairlights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels is generally not as fast as green and red. & digicam; and dcrab try to reconstruct the missing green and red parts of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a matter how many color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstructed, you will get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value to your taste. you'll probably have to put it somewhat higher than the Standard 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of & digicam; pic-editing. in order to keep the time for the demo bale, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demenosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to obtain a complete image from the color-filtered image sensor, which have many cameras and which have a Matrix-coloured pixels. these algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbreonstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicam; and Dcraw make you three alternatives to you: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD-Interpolation. according to some tests, it was the first algorithm used by dcrab. it creates color artifacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable score.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you're familiar with the colour deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correcting values here. this is certainly the best method for a colour correction.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color formations and returns instructions how they should be returned. there are also LCMS and digicam; information such as the color space of a color space in the other so are the colours as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions, if a picture is opened in the image processing module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile file Sing here to store the folder, like / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you all save your profile. & digicam; then examines the folder then during start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the way & quot; standard squot; for your profile you can change. everything can be changed later on opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management panel is an alternative to Xcalib or Argonyl. here just your pictures are not managed on the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be made to the camera producer and model which you use. not all profiles are created on the same type. currently there are no color mapping or gamma-correction. currently, dcraw Gamma is not necessary to perform conversions of 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the colour mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your printer has been given back. this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your camera and some colors, so you could manually correct, rather than to the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious that the color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not for the models of Canon. so here is a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. this answer is naturally inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style to recognise: F for an exact style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Neutral, P for the Standard Style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; image viewed and image processing; many modules supported, which have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distro has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. then, select a list of available modules. then, these modules are displayed as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some of the menu navigation menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be seen through the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusted the time between the images of the screen, normally 4-5 seconds. the other anchoring off turn off the metadata or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all the cameras supported. on the right side up, a button is connected to identify which the camera is connected to identify and in screen mode. including, there are serial port settings, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage here.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom of the bottom you can use the path for USB- and Firewire- (IEEE-1394 or i-link). this field is only active when you have chosen a USB- or FireWire harram camera from the camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Check your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with digicam; you need to connect the camera to your computer to set it in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if & digicam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set up camera and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">The option of confirming dialog for the shifting of &gt; pictures in the trash bin can display the talk of & digicam; while deleting a photos in an album, you can find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be used in silence by & digicam; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any return. otherwise, you need to apply the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also make the display of the welcome screen of & digicam; at the starting computer. this accelerates under the starting procedure of & digicam;</seg>
<seg id="334">The attitude adjustment in the start to new photos search & digicam; the basic folder for new or deleted albums / photos. if something from the basic folder was deleted, asks & digicam; you will delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different colour schemas can be used in & digicam; used to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can select from the toolbar settings. a preview of available design is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in writing a new design for & digicam; you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicam; contains a quick processing with some basic tools. you can use these photos to view and fix your photos and add-on to the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the video clip.</seg>
<seg id="338">The processing modification includes a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them stand as modules in & digicam; they are not part of your distration. further information about the KIPI modules can be found in the section of sculptor.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current file number, enlaration factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at upper edge and below the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions change your photos. don't change the original photo before you have to store Save or button Save from the toolbar. NOTE that you can't use the original photo as soon as you have stored the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly send a copy of your image before you change it. you can save and save.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the menu or restore image processing into the toolbar. you lose any change in which you have done in the photo since last Storing.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of the processing processing can be undone or restored. the last promotion you can undo and reundo by editing advice or recreate reproduce from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this often, use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to retreat and Ctrl; -Umsalt-Z to be used.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; push the return or restore button in the toolbar a moment longer, you get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions are also undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have launched the picture processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or entries in the menu, you are asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can print and cut out in the photo using Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To fit a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select a magnification factor.</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you will be able to use the Esc key. if you don't want to use the button dialog. if you don't want to call this in the setup dialog by & digicam; you can see this in the setup dialog. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the image you can print the picture, select the standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings, before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or all propositions. all images can be printed out of your choice. you just need to select the images from your choice. you just need to follow the wizard, just need your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digicam; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which is available with important information and actions for the selected pictures. the same side bar is available, without the navigation spreading, even if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same riders will be appearing on the sidebar and disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label screen, you can enter or insert labelling with unlimited size or insert it. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF and IPTC fields to be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be cut according to the 2000 characters. if you want to use IPTC inscription in other applications, you should notice that limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you comment it, use either the button to use or switch to the next picture, the labelling will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the using button there is a button more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also use the metadata in the files. however, this will always be conducted if you have written a metadata setting that will always be written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section valuation shows a value scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting. it can be applied with a single click on the 5 stars onto the top bar, or with the keyboard shortest Ctrl + 0... 5. to rate this, choose from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. coding of encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The headnote view shows a keybox to the filtering of the keywords, the jaw and a selection box with those previously used in this & digicam; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The sample tree is customized according to a specified search word. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief after input jigures at a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set through marking the relevant fields in the tree. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the sample tree, this will be applied to the highlighted picture, if you wish to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the section jaw filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Rear Slide Strip is used to change the selection of the display in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, Keyword and search settings. if additionally, one or more keyword filter is used on the right side, only the cutting volume of these two are displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull and let off. suppose you have chosen more pictures in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can move it out from the right side bar and on the choice. then, a dialog is asked if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example shows the main window the images on a calendar day. the sample filter has been reduced to no keywords. they were picked with Strg + a and then saved there a keyword from the right query tree to the selection and discarded there. a dialog is asked if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and creates and determine that it is a must or be, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which in the database is sought. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): argument to the operator, which is a name or a string that is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an Advanced Search about all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the checkbox at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why are Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have adapted it mainly to & digicam; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one is one of the colors of your camera or scanners from actually photographed or scanned colors. you can easily print that colors on your monitor or scanners from your camera or scanners are identical to you or in the web with them from your digital darkchamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes on colour management, then everyone wants to know which buttons must be made for the results that he would like to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management workflows. in addition, you will give you sufficient information to make your own informed decisions to make the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workworkflow performed every six below, you must not take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that calibrated to the sRGB color space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other aspect issues are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and the life for all so easy, why would you use another color space and thus have to worry about color spoons?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the dirty region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB With some larger colour spaces, please visit Bruce Lindblooms excellently and click on info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">I have to Couti my monitor, when I decided to work in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in sRGB color space or not, you need to find your monitor from sRGB, as sRGB running on sRGB mode, then you need to use it as a color space of sRGB, then you need to use a monitor on the sRGB-standard or both a suitable monitorprofile.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections available, which can make a picture in most cases. use it before you try to progress further manually.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, equal, automatic and contrast extending from the menu correct and automatically expand your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see what's best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the final value over the entire image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without shades. this feature is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Like: this method adjusts the lightening factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity values is as flat as possible. this means that the fact that the histogram of intensity is produced as flat as possible. it is a very powerful operation, which makes either miracles in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic down: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue canal. they determined the dark and bright boundary and adjusted the rotten, green and blue channels in the complete histogrammed range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extended: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of RGB values of a picture by the move the lowest and highest possible values in between each possible range and one rejiustation of all values in between. this is only visible with selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi automatic tool to perform the white balance of an pictures.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-off correction is something limited to a color space of 8 bit per color. if you are able to run away from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you operate the white balance in raw mode, your ways are able to respond better in 16-bit mode.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance sheet that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it on the menu entry of white balance.</seg>
<seg id="397">The showcase can be adjusted in the size. on the left hand, both the original image and the preview of the target image are adapted. the preview can be regarded as the preview of the tool. if you want to see the original whiteboard you want to click on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="398">The view photos has a red markers. the luminance of Pixels under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram displayed that as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very useful, even in well lit pictures, most Pixel will have very small Luminiscence. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or their sum will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadows you can enhance or down the attendance details of your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls around you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then on the image preview for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indicator increases the colours, if more than a color channel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save and store exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be stored into a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets recalls all the filter values again on their default values and the associated neutral white balance. NOTE that also neutral settings will be displayed as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the codiets per colour channel of the machined image format. 8-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images, but this encoding is also needed for high-quality images. this coding, calculating time and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog like the editing of shell profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed by the subwindows for the use of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool in the menu is available in the menu under colors. this tool allows you to store a built-in way to adjust for several colour channels simultaneously. this is helpful if you need the same problem and therefore you'll always find the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct equilibrium is the tool for the gradation that you will find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digicam; tool colouring effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and a canister filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, also Sabatite is called, an effect that was developed by the light of a short flashing. this had the effect that the lighten differs have been reduced by the second lighting. the result was a part negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">Intensity in intensity. with about 50% intensity, the image shows the image which is chemically possible. a further increase is finally triggered a negative image that is not to be used on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is the (1) and the edited version (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation, that he has a stronger contrasting effect the colours brilliant and glowing. try it easy, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a film which is made from the Japanese company Fujifilm is made. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia provides very saturated color but also some photographs, especially those are hardly imagined, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The NeonFilter simulates a tendency on the contrast monitors. the parameter level controls the magnitudes of the results and the slider repeats the strength of the Neon. for large images, the filter can strain the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to modify the color counter and the brightness of your photos using the tools in the menu below colors. all of your Justys you can look at the preview. once you are happy with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a good choice rather than to increase the saturation instead of increasing them. all the changes you can do in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leuchy / contrast / Gamma, the tool can be very complicated. even if the dialog for this tool can be very complicated, you need only the range of the sliders just below the area of the tipping. specifically, the three shift underneath the histogramms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, active canals or the selected area. below the graph, three slaves are clicked into the graph and the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright area.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn to learn to postpone the controller and respect it, how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand you can see the original and the preview of the picture. the preview can be updated, with the settings of the picture, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box, the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis is displayed. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram of a single column is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic scale is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the supreme for the dark tones, the mean for the bright tones and the bottom for the medium tones, is frequently called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush applicants can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for an entirely automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the selection values for each range. there are also two controller to change the output values. for example, the compression values can be used, for example, the compression values can be used for example, as a background to create something different in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values will be automatically set depending on the intensity values.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as well as loading: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in filesystem and later recharged. the Gimp levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipet, you will be able to use the font pipette that you want to use and click the preview values of the histogramms for red, green, blue, and lighting channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Fexposure compensation regulation checks all the color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is what you'll see the effect on a preview only and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below, a sample for adjustment of the input values used on the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, and output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the revised image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamic in dependency of your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel depending on the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures with a digital camera, the linear mode of a constant colour produces a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move an injection valve to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that bright tones can be a darker and the corresponding image pixel darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos it is to see a red mark. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original score. create a point on this line and move it on and down, until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you can have generated this file system and later uploaded. the file format is the Gimp curvformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you are using this method and the three colour pipet buttons automatically create the control points for all channels of the shadow, middle and sun block. select the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for red, green, blue- and Luminescence.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option covers all color channels, to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you'll get the combined result. this is what you can see the effect only in the preview, and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo, which was corrected in the Luminiscion channel. shadow and sun bulb was applied to the colour pipette and the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of & digicam; image processing is a tool to enhance the color channels, or change the colour shades of the photographs.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel-Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images. you can edit it from the menu of the colours channel blender.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels. the left section of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison to its own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview image has a red marker. if you position this in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to indicate the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: regulator for red, green and construction allows you to disable these channels. if you want to disable this channel, the image will also be able to reduce the power tool for the generation of great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you are Monochrome, the reduction of a coloration comes from a visible noise that occurs from the same spot in colour channel. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion into which you could reduce the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any any type of blender options allow you to save and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Fexposure compensation regulation checks all the color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is what you'll see the effect on a preview only and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo shown in the Blue channel. the Luminance option has been enabled. the original image is visible under (1) and the edited picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photograph was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step step, as color pictures can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford Panf Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film-cut with a green lens filter. it looks great when all the scenes and fits very well into the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranienter: simulates a black / white film-cut with a orange relief filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Oranienter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotors: simulates a black / white film-cut with a red lens filter. thus created dramatic anaids and can simulate the moon lights for the day time. so, like the 003 Cokin (tm) Roter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film-cap with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 coil (tm) light filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates hot bright and medium tones for a bit of cold in the shades. this is very similar to the process of a print and redevelopment in a pipiatonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and similar to the 005 Cokin (tm).</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the digicam; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a colour picture or not, you can look like a painting on a screen, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for that.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimensional of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digicam; tool framework, a decorative frame can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an Betrachis in the borders of a photos is no easy task. to retain the picture of a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your image. transcary the image with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), cashed it with a very thin three-dimensional setting of the ideal accessory for a button effect and decoratively add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: if the frame width is in percent. the range limit for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially when using the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple formatted text into a picture. this also goes to several spots when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with your mouse. use text alignment, orientation, color from the color space and the character set. at the end you will need to finish the character set. at the end you just need a frame to finish the text and / or a semibre background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button "OK." after the picture was saved once, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the digicam; tool stencil, you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image allows for use in the image processing can be used in order to put the image on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there is no restrictions on the size and orientation. if you want to add the template format and should work with maximum compression (9). if you want to add a stencil file format and should send us an e-mail in English to the digicam; mail list digicam-Users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">When you use this tool for the first time, you have to set your stencil folder with the button basic folder in the dialog. select the folder you will notice for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the templates has been set, a tree vision is reflected in the original structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder will update the stuption of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">You will find three buttons on which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the desired image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this knob shrinks the image. if you want to use a template onto the whole picture, if you want to use a template onto the whole picture, check the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move it: use this button to move it below the stencil image. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Do not use OK if you want to use the template onto your picture. then the image will be automatically adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="479">Digicam; provides three different tool for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy to produce, particularly in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Inferior mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not work to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has several parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitally visualised images require a correction of the sharpness that are combined with only minimalist differences to a color point. the same characteristics will be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras will usually need more then suitable sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, some camera has been used to heat internal progress. images in the raw format should always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner does a sharpense filter already during the reading of the image. if you turn it, check out the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by calling a photo with the sharpening throwing sharpening. this can be edited with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But they should be careful with caution when the results are not very natural, because the focus will focus on sharpness of the edges, but increasingly focus on the menu entry. they can be focused on the menu entry and further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to record the image is much easier than it is easier to focus and experiment something with the menu entry and experiment something with settings. the showcase on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp measurizing is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can you see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview helps to edit the image. a showcase shows the output of the filter with current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first. an increase in radius or amount intensified the effect. if you increase the wrong mask, noise and get the impression of grats near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius turns one how many pixels on each side of a edge is affected by the filter. high resolution images allow higher radii. you should see pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the pampered picture which is added to the original. thus the strength of the edge is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB value and to apply difference amount. thus, this way can be applied with a soft switching between the killing of the sharpenes and thus avoiding beauty abnorms in shifters, beliefs and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture (2). unsharp masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digicam; tool refocusing focused on a picture by improving the edge. it used the copyright protected-filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to do a photo to & quot; refocusing quot; in which it is focusing on a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. it is used to boot better results than unsharp maskware. you can start it from the menu by calling colors focussing in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular available is much better than the Gauß 'The Faltung. the rapid result is also influenced by the sourcecode, which is far from the original quellpixel size. the FIR Vienna version of the Gauß' Faltung is influenced in most cases even very strongly removed from remote pixel size.</seg>
<seg id="499">This is the radius of the circular folding. it is the main parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. if your image should be very unsharp, then, if your image should be very unsharp.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: the correlation can help produce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. dependable values are 0,5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation reduces the correlation effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Coarse filter: an increase of the preference filter can help you reduce artifical values. however, values are higher than 0.1 but only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low. a useful value is 0,03. a high value is still further dirty.</seg>
<seg id="502">Clarity: this is the radius for the Gauß 'medium hot. use this parameter if your infermentation dice it is. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 if you should not use a value equal to zero, so you may also need to increase correlation and / or preference filters.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizenge: this value determines the size of the transformation format to have good results, especially if you select a value for the circular sharpness or the palate's sharpness, if you select a value for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value in the range from 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. each individual test focus will be placed for later and can be downloaded for later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the viewers, color and intensity carritures on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module, before you change the picture otherwise, the reason is that much operations are not immediately visible, but left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you can read and compress pictures, eg. JPEG, you should apply the module on uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks improve better results as sharpening. this could cause this to sharply a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, you must always need to remove artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it cannot display the effect of impooraries. for the Viennese filters you can also show the effect of the FIR Wiener Filters as well as the wrong mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better with machining of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour picture has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analogue camera. the unfocused outcome is attributable to the Auto Focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For further information on methods to sharpendiecorrection in digital image, you can consult a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator is pushing the infermentation of the field of darkness to create a natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tinted allows a modified color for the pupille. if you like blue eyes instead of dark, you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool-error correction is one of the most developed tools needed to remove non-desired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inner Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences than starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the riders draw and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details penser [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value causes less homogeneous regions of smooth and details. for example, a value of 0.9 should be necessary to ensure that no sharpening is not necessary. please refer to the detail maintainer.</seg>
<seg id="520">Discrete actuator Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while being a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film piece or create a high value of well- JPEG artifacts are best placed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this places the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then define the relative humidity. thus add this value to the level of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns greater structures. the more this value is required, the more becomes more complex if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulent effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: there is how often the algorithm go through. usually, there is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-gradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is chosen, it should also be small to produce a long term. so you should select this value as much as possible and for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrale stepping distance [0,1, 10]: integral pedometer in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid Sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the multi-quality you use by selecting this option is only small. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can take a very long time and yet a high CPU load. they can therefore break the calculation at any time with button plump.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors have been corrected with little artifical products. as you can see, there is an independent black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie storage during the voyage was wurdel.The original image is visible under (1) and the fixed picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digicam; prebeam is a very powerful tool to decrease picture noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is available to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, to remove. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noises from digital cameras, you can read them in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy, which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you will need only the lower window details and the advanced settings may stay with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) needed for the filter. large values improve the time the filter per pixel and can be spoiled for the image and the color in it is smoothed and thereby smaller errors is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the focus level. this value sets the pixel pitch into the front line. if it is increased, sponges disappear when you need to change the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and predators or lubricating again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the edge. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot all the noise if you want to remove it at a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefactors.</seg>
<seg id="538">Illuminance: controls the luminous tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to enhance a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerances of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to enhance a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker ranges, which typically are stronger than increasing their own risk.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: control the adjustment of phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius at variations of the luminance, when it is lifted up, a decay can occur. if it is high, clash and phasenjitter may appear on the edges. it can remove prejudices and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and store: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for predattion that you have set can be stored into the filesystem and later uploaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how trash relief can change their lives. the original image is marked with (1) and the revised version (2), with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. this solution makes it a bit soft to sign the image and experiment a lot more easier than an image entry and experiment with the slipper. the showcase on the right side of the dialogs indicates the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digicam; photo restauration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease Photographic file.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restauration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts to emerge in digital, original or nightlife. the smoothing is done along the image contours and thereby maintains the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the texture is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS labs in Caen / FrannFrance and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifies reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas, it creates some compression & quot; artefacts & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are visible in uncompressed picture. this setting should be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. each setting of photo-restoration can be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo reproduction is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can take a very long time and yet a high CPU load, so you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with rectifical noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that is taken on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera. you can see the notorious film piece in the faces. the original image is visible under (1) and the revised version (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo reproduction. this time, Textures were actually read on an old color photo that have been produced using a scanner. the original image is visible from the Scanners and the photo paper. this image is visible below (1) and the fixed picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digicam; tool Hotpixel allows different pixel size pixels using a CCD camera, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels, especially when high quality raw mode is a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression has a built-in supporting for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo using a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad Pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark picture. the tool will detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">When you have an old digital camera, it is important that you have the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to correct image. NOTE that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically invites you in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture section and the preview can be corrected to you within the image shows the output of the filter with current settings. poor pixels are emphasized in all forestry departments.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose a area around the defective pixels at the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. this is the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durst: an average of the neighboring pixel returns. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for one-dimensional interpolation this is separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels pick up a distance of 1 of the pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim).</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less on a pixel surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) are used to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which then is used to interpolisher pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel bug on a color photo, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the correct picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetal correction is a tool to correct the Vignesport, i.e., exposed corners, one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially in the middle and large photo format, they often reach the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shady) they often reach the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that indicates the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center-filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens, also with Center filter, a hole of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise inferment effects can be created through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure of modern film camera and colour camera models, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerless by simulating an equivalent filter. the tool Vignetening correction. the transformation using a Centerfilter is applied on a picture. the algorithm is protected by the copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three reglers you can control the Vignesetting-correction filter and with three further layers of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the level of light amplifiers at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which means an optical filter with an aperture of 2, or randomly, reducing the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignesetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Glue strength, contrast and gamma -settings: the beam of a picture with the Vignesetting-correction will readjust the brightness of the target with these options. they need only positive values to adjust, because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the gradation of & digicam; image processing from the menu of Color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetal correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignesetting in the corners and (2) the correct image. a stronger beam and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digicam; Linear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour accuses cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades handles the general geometric distortion of lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular-effect, but fluctuating on the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of graves corrects the distant corners opposite the second count. if you combine these two geometric versions can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second grade. with negative values can be corrected tonneneous distortions and positive values of calderous distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion in the fourth degree. this value looks stronger along the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter illustrates the parameters of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and performs a correction of first gradation by negative values. negative values can be resized while positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightly: this value is adjusting the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values indicate the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values it increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog mit a preview the distortion correction. the values you use for your picture are stored and used in the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or rectifical correction should be done prior to all auditing or sizes of changes. in case you have to cut out a picture above all. in case you are able to cut a picture and then an error-shaped correction would be the effect behind.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correcting you find this tool a vertical and horizontal environment line. move it to an important place, like e.g. the edge or a building wall in your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines on this site. in connection you can correct the tonne- / kissenic distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cone-like distortion, the resulting image will be black corners. you can remove them from the diverid tool in the menu without cutting out the editing or on the zoom control.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the error-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives as e.g. photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the all-angle in the image 90 degrees. NOTE that when you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of a perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the spherical correction of a church in Norway. the original image is among (1) and the revised image (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website which restores under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below you can set two parameters for fillet and film sensitivity (ISO). the iso controller changes the amount of a high sensitive film. the iso control is changing the amount of the film piece and the dominance of the colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter is mapped to the reproduce of infrared film, especially the Grüncanal does not make any sense the effect on black / white photos as the colour formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filmeekites applied to a landscape image from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the revised image under (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a type of aura in the hairlights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digicam; filter Filmpiece is a simple to use tool to reproduce film piece like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of films to increase the manufacturers great silver-grain of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-proof effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears in the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere. if you want to see this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy, especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, though often higher values are needed, if you need more grains, so you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film shell element in a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the machined parts (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digicam; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil paintings. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digicam; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil paintings. natural pictures and styles live well for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers around that effect on effect. the upper elects the pinch size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smooth glides or, from the other side considered, the scarness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the beast is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels wide picture is 1 and GlDeposit 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicam; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity in the drawing. it is helpful if you imagine what scene could have chosen for you to skate it. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper arm selects the pin size and the bottom adjust the contrast (griffs).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon filter. the original image (1) and the changed picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The pldigicam; filter engraving impresses your image in 3-D as if it was shown in the wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digicam; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which colour is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mony landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the machined image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo in a work of pouring effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image in cells and makes it look like it is considered by glassblooks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: Analog to wave blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with button end.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo using immoral effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom infermentation: spores the image along with globular lines that imbales out of a centre. this simulates a zoomy camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radical injections: explores the image by rotation of pixels. this simulates the infermentation of a turned camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: diluted the image to generate a non-focused camera lenses. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement essential: spoints the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the infermentation of a linear moving, z: b: a car or by train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Uscious unsharpening: spoils the image soft in the dark and strongly in bright tones. this creates images with a dreaming and shiny focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or a steaming hot and subtle.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelunschärfe: destroys the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the infermentation of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpening: find the paint blocks in the image and picks it out without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: it shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, by filling with an average pixel score.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. this calculates the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The regentrop is a nice little tool to make shelves on your image. this gives the natural your images a great look. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows to alter the size of drops. because the drip size doesn't necessarily reflect the size of small images, it changes the amount and the density of the drop. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stop using the & digicam; image processing a range free from regentrop. use the range of tools to select the area, e.g. a face, which will remain free if you want to drop off the filter drop off from regentrop.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regurgent Filters. the original image (1) shows a silent sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset over a storm. the default values used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning to the right orientation. with the menu you'll find transformers or transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo Inflatable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enhance a photo image for minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to zoom out is easy. the big question is, how can you find a picture blisters and more details? how can you find a picture of a picture? how can you find the missing information here? how can you see the missing information here? how can you see a good work here. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale in the desired size with the tool size. select transformations in the menu and specify the destination values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge A picture. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo impetus was developed by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the riders new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain a aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the size of the new size is kept in the original image of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns greater structures. the more this value is required, the more becomes more complex if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons can store and store exactly. each one can be saved as a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very quick at what it makes it happen, but it can take a long time and a high CPU load after yourself. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of the inflamed image by using a small colour picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3) is the result of the linear standard magnification compared to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The trimming of a photos is not only a common surgical procedure, but also a frequently underestimated tool for a picture. the image processing allows you to create a picture with mouse, by pressing the mouse and draw up the rectangle. then you will see this rectangle when you move your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">Once you get rid of the mouse, the area of the photos is cut off. this allows you to change a good overview as your photo after the trimming board. you can create a new rectangle by tighten up to the corners of the square by clicking it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are happy with the cutting button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save to File menu, to store the newly trimmed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the swing area you can change the size of the angle by sliding the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the Tools Following the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high format or horizontal format. in the high format, the larger value of height and in horizontal format of width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool I use a ratio of aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same whether you can see inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons are currently using vertically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the dialog box, you can set up with the Max. relationship button to the range of trimming on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool can be cut down on aspect ratio, depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical), if you are stored as default values in dependence on orientation. the modified picture measurements are shown in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data is reflected in the trimmed picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the interference help allow help to invent us to make your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third reins, harmonious triangles are possible to share a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden center is a division of the various natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blowers leaves of a sunflower. it dives all possible things to feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos using your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; ab, where every number after 1 is the sum of their two advanced numbers. the resulting diversion is 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition that is usually follows as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relieving lines when you put together a picture. these help will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring your goal good results for your photos. compared with the third-regel the golden spirals creates the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the sight of the viewer along the line of spirals and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the square of golden spirals, also called gold rectangles. it should be enough to direct the eye to the composition of composition. it can be a line that can be a line, or different objects. this something can be done without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangle also from the above-mentioned golden spirals. NOTE that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonals on these lines can be placed along with a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break up your frame, you will try to plazate a effect of professional photographers dynamic symmetry. the result is a very attractive composition which you can't reach.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal and vertical mirrors are used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can put the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any corner.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it's easy to fix the camera, not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture where things can fix at an angle. you can select this with the & digicam; image processing and the tool-free rotation and adjust the target angles.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button presets you can put the slide back to 0 degree. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown above.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module free rotation and a vertical line available. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix it with a pressure on the left mouse. right now, you can adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot an image you will find unwanted three-dirty holes in the corners. one way to repair it is the function transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the auto cut. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">Option anti-aliasing smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. NOTE the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspektive transformations are performed to a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be recalculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which can help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New widths: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are caused by the transformation, are in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New heights: the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are caused by the transformation, are in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees on the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjustment of a perspective, the image is slightly polluted. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adaptions produce an twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you'll get unhappy three-dirty holes on the corners. a possibility to unite it is to cutting off the image with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The mold is used to postpone a part of the picture in one direction and move the upper part in the picture. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. with other words, a rectangle will be converted into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shear your image by using the horizontaly angle and vertical angle. if you can press horizontal and vertically down the angle if you are displayed on zero. a preview of the effectiveness are shown and the new dimensions of the target table are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">With your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, like e.g. the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the template tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After making the shear carried out, the picture will be a bit spoiled. for a single shear this effect is negligible, but two sings erupward twice as much meagment and so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shear the picture has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images of your system and, in some cases, from the type such libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicam;</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image to add and edit. the geographic data will be displayed in an external browser in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module is based on geographical localization tools to locate pictures geographically in the spherical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo. altitude, sustained and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track than XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsyou can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device and convert.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. in order to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded into an automatic correlation which shows the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera time should be carried out on the GMT. this can be done with time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation is a top deviation for the GPS time and camera time. is the deviation, including the maximum value for this period is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a site, edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the difference difference between 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used when you're not using a matching data. if you know that in reality an locality between camera and GPS is able to insert these boundaries here and then correlate the button correlate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place. as the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next notice, you only need to use the button OK to insert the data at the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The localization can also be found with the displayed map and gradually. select this in the respective region and expand this. height must always be selected manually. the card can always be selected manually, and the card can be changed between card mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Outside of the KIPI module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script used to add a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module Picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module may be able to export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums the HTML pages to be exported and the parameter for the HTML pages. the character set will be encoded as UTF-8 encoding.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted. the rider is allowed to select all albums. you will need to select this albums. you will need to select this albums on the right hand. you will need to select a great number of albums. in the area, you will quickly find a great number of albums. in the area you will find the Albenchschau and the lyrics displayed in the head of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The appearance is defined as the general appearance and layout for each side. this rider can also create a page on each picture. if you click on a picture a new page is displayed in the image. otherwise, the picture will be shown directly with your standard picture viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your own pictures. choose a folder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information will be saved in the new images too.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth, you can change the standard color depth and obviously the file size. all other settings are declared themselves.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Rider thumbnails allows you to watch some of the album's slide for the thumbnails; these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user like far the action. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the page, the window doesn't work automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to indicate whether errors during the generation. the web browser will automatically start to close the preview of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to check out a selection of images and perform on them basic surgery such as rotations, zooming or shifts. the viewer can be used with short instructions and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG lossless module is a tool to change pictures without blocking your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to store images in JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The sequence of loss-free storage is the filesize, since no compression of the colour formations undertake place. you can also find it in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-click is a tool to connect you to your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team below kde-Imaging @ kde.org. respect: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailinglist kde-Imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata moduls you can copy data from a picture to another. then select the import function dialog with which you want to copy the file setup dialog with which you want to copy the data setup dialog. the data will be copied to which you have pushed on the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please look at exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The mpeg codiers module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG-Video, with a defined length, which allows packages of mjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic image file to the MP2 or WAV of the diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically on the correct video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide. with this module, it is possible to create a background color for the DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you will need to select images that are packed into MPEG slides. after that, you can create the module via Apple MPEG slides.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed below image files in the portfolio. you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should adapt the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD, you must select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should indicate the time in seconds which is displayed a picture. the speed of the image is defined below. a low value creates a very sudden, a high contrast.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set aside. in doubt, you should put it black. in doubt, you should define the name and path of the desired file under the name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can go to the generation of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer, you can drink a coffee and enjoy the slides, if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths of the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right button below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print several images on one sheet paper together in standard photographers. this is also automatically wired with the picture processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or imprint with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or import your images stored in RAW format from three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. there is a look at dcraw, that it may produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file which should be converted and launch the module. the Raw-Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. you can preview the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adapt the values to optimize the convergence process. the basic parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBA conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera is in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and the filename remains the default and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss carved algorithm and produced the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, maintains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to process your images or later, you should not use the JPEG format, because it is only allowed to have a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as storage format, the metadata files in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process so you can use abrupting.</seg>
<seg id="863">The fork processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time. use this mode when you're sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite the existing file. however, it is helpful if this progress is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the image convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can prefix the prefix and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to alter the size of several images of a image collection. you can use the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can use the image smaller or enlarge. in addition, four kinds of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 din.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the picture will be automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Disproportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparations: prepares the image for photo pressure. the user can adjust the screen resolution and the size of the photopapiers. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures before. additional images can be moved to the list of sending images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the image window will be shown to select the images provided by you. you can add another images with a file selected dialog. a preview on the right side will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and add it to the list of sending images this way.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images, the selected pictures are removed from the list of sending images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures you have selected the button OK to open the new message box of your e-mail clients. you have to add just the addresses and the subject. you have already attached you as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Please pay attention to many images to once again. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sent e-mails. it is probably a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used each time until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients choose from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you have to install the Gmail agent on your machine before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting the comments in a file the comments will add the comments to the images in a text file and join the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in images file format and select the original files in JPEG format, the original Exifdetails will be added to send pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is ready, the window will not automatically shut down, so you can watch the status feedback, if your e-mail programme will be started automatically at the end. with button closure, you can close this window? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced, the slide shows a window with questions about how you want to see your slide show. you can select between the selected and selected pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions in the presentation is enabled very elegant pictures from OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the slide show is very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name filenames ensures that the filename of images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop provides that the presentation will be displayed in a pin loop. then you can break it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option does accidentally make sure the pictures will be displayed in a random order. thus, it is not used as the sequence of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Considering the pictures, the temporary distance between the individual images can be set to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effects depend on your friends you should show the presentation your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between them you can choose. randomly chooses a different effect on any transition between pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide you can access a toolbar at the top-left edge. move the mouse into this corner to view you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slides.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation.</seg>

<seg id="897">This module uses the actual picture, depending on the selected option of the undermenhment, as background for your KDE working space.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and video with notes, you can play with & kphotoalbum; see picture by this browsing, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, then in persons, places and in the group keywords are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories, for which you have posted on your pictures and video with notes. in addition, there are entries to view the file correction of your hard disk and of course view the current screenshots. the following will be described here.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry level, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images will be shown on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images on a few images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view images to view images of your active area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, every person has the same symbol in front of its name. you can also save with & kphotoalbum; however, for every person you can have their own image screen, this also applies to places, jigs and other categories you have defined. see the image.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images aside from the name, select the button, which is right on the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can display the view for each category separately, that you can display e.g. symbols with images from people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have appropriate pictures).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, select which image for each individual person is to be displayed. in order to see this image, you need to edit the image file menu (described in closer) and select the picture factor for the corresponding Person. in the cashts window, you can adapt the picture factor according to your wishes and therefore select which portion of the picture is indicated or stored in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you are looking for searching the entry in the main window, you will find a dialogue in which dialogue for creating the image features is very similar. this dialogue you can see on the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labelling or description, the labels or descriptions of the pictures will be searched for this text. if you wish, you can also use a date if you wish to search for a part of the total data, i.e., for example, in 1971, or the entire date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all pictures in the bottom of the window, as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like reading books, rather than want to try different functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select the first dialog box, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; - Demo will be downloaded - a few example images are loaded and you can test the functions of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main center of & kphotoalbum; see the time bar. here. as the name suggests, this strip gives you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time bar can display several different time units. each strip gives you another unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by view the strip only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can be interactive to the following ways: you can select the displayed entries from the database (if you select a date, the time line will always show you the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button. if you select the mouse over the lineal of the time line, i.e. the time data is displayed. you can cancel a range when you click on a bar at the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML Web pages with your images. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; this is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version described above the menu to create HTML... call upon the menu page.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three sectors contents, layout and finish. in the following each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the supervisor and a description that should contain HTML-file later. on cphotoalbum; HTML-sample page you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; file will be prepared to see the page page. more information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information on the HTML pages will be displayed. this allows you to avoid information on the viewer without a description. please note that all images of a party are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to conceive certain images from certain Betrachs.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can set up how the HTML pages look like. most setting methods are unequivocally, so it doesn't have been noted.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. thus, those who have to consider your website and have a monitor, which have a maximum resolution of 800x600, or even download photos, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your side can change the resolution at any time the resolution you have to change. it can therefore also search your pictures with low resolution, browse. if he would like to see a picture above, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different folders and the URL where your site will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best of all, select a base folder for all of your HTML files, and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder where all your images will be stored. this folder will be saved and installed automatically for all future pictures. this allows you to select a folder or a KDE support protocol for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if you have created a URL in the base folder. if you have created a web browser, after the pages you have created here, should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If you do not want to copy the HTML files to you yet in the final target file, you need to manually specify the import function. this is not the subfolder of the current files, it is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder inside that are all subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just written adjustment possibilities were included all three on basic folder or URLs. in this case, a subfolder, whose name is laid down in output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you might want to have a lot of time for viewing the images, reception location, etc. you will need to work with & kphotoalbum; this work is not even easier.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are exemplified with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. you can only tell it if the images are stored in the file or if you have to use a link in the file, you can have all the images here and so regardless of them. the apparent disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a two way. first, searches are not found in the file of the .kim file. if you have searched the images you have created in the file of the .kim file. this is naturally only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following phase, dialogue for exporting images will be described above the menu file exporting... to call up.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act alone or external .kim files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you select the manually select the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since the most images have been compressed using JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not to compress the files. if you wish, simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum picture size limit. if you send your favorite pictures you would like to send your pictures, as the .kim file otherwise would be very large. here you can say that each image is maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you are using a file with .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Import... it will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database is as described in it.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consist of four steps. first you must select which images you would like to import from, after which folder will import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are interested in the category people of the imported file staff (if you are a dull) while this category is called in the third dialog window, which are to be imported as categories of imported file to imported file and to which categories are used in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can collect the categories of the imported file using the categories of your current database. one example for this you can see on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It simply must be easy to browse images and look: if you see pictures, you often want to view images from different picture groups and see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook you will find the various steps from (1) to find information about your pictures, via (2) for searching and seeing, up to (3) advanced themes and adaptability.</seg>
<seg id="948">Kphotoalbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it was expanded and today will also take care of your videos. in many places this manual will take pictures, but often also closes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all his information in the file index.xml in the supreme folder of their images. it is a simple XML file that you can assure you with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal back and revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; noticeable the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Starts. if you would like to read another database with images, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Using the menu entry settings / photo album; you can set up into a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of user manual you will discuss the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call the settings of preview and options for viewing the viewer. for each setting up an extensive help you can call on the F1-button and a click on the requested option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described as you can select for each picture of different features, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">View the dialog box which is used to process already existing groups. you can select a symbol and select a symbol for each existing group.</seg>
<seg id="955">In section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete list of members, e.g. all members of a group at a group instead of all groups of a middle class as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the settings possibilities you are available to determine the list of members. in the left list box, you can select the category that you would like to configure. in the left window of window there is a list with the current category and in the right one of the subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; divides his module system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin Interface. more information on the homepage from Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu modules, and they are not described in this handbook because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have an aid page which you can call over the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications will be used together with each other, it can always be used with the demo database; therefore, you should use the demo database with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinputs\ &gt; or via the menu. don't say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">Applications that use the modules of KIPI, are very different making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which can also use KIPI, is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order is not supported, so you will be able to use the functions with & kphotoalbum; so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which corresponds to the current view, so all the images that shows you the picture preview now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Beside the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also has a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the contents of a category, e.g. all the persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will have the category that you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums, so you can use the photoalbum; so if you should have selected persons to view and the module will continue to pass this.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove these from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen, once you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are familiar from any other KDE application, you can look at the top of an menu and a tool bar. at the moment, you can see the window in which you can see your picture database. in the section we'll see you on this window, but now click on the photos show that shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the opportunity to see every picture with observations. this includes information about the people shown on the picture, where the picture is taken either individually or for a larger number of images added at the same time. if, for example, all images are shown by Jesper and all images in Copenhagen have been added.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these remarks may be used for searching and browsers as you can see in the section. if you want to see this comment, if you want to see the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In case you can see three lists using a text box by selecting people, places and jigs. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always be able to use it if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the moving pictures inside the list: if you are for example a family celebration, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are depicted, you can find that the used names are shifted upward, people can quickly find and assign the persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the symbol for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture, you may like to edit any selected pictures and add those photos with notes. simply click on the buttons and back buttons which are located below the picture's preview right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and add the menu item Several entries to once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a group. to show you that it is a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the catalogue, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or subcategory. additionally, you can also add an entry to a category or subcategory. attention, this assumes that you can not sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the dialog, by clicking the bar that form the outer edge of the frame, click and move it. you can move it from a frame as well as you pull it out of the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, you have to be satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also send a frame also completely. if you would like to get this window later, use the button options... and here a window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images showing in the browser, you get an overview with images of the currently selected pictures, or all the images if you don't see any filter. for example, you can see the size of the screenshots, to configure the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you leave a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is shown in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new ad window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can delete images in the picture preview, and simply delete the corresponding images from the you, and select either the remove button or select the menu button. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use a photo album that you can have stored on your hard drive. in the picture you can take a photo album somewhere. in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required images from the hard drive can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images where the right upper left is cut off, but for example, the images are stored on the hard drive. for example 5-9, however, the screenshots are present, so you can see the preview of these pictures. however, you can't see these pictures with the picture.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function doesn't require you to copy files from the folders and you would not want to avoid files from the folders. if you want to avoid any worms to your pictures, please buy a bigger hard disk in order to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu Pictures, you will find a submenu with the name of privacy. if you wish to make a little more privacy you wish to remain unaccessible in the menu of privacy. alternatively, you can also view all the images that your little sister must be, control and the menu entry everything except the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">For this you have set what images will be hidden in case of Fall. if you want to insert the images in the case of your little sister, simply click on the images you have to be blocked. if you want to see the images back, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password, which to unlock the images must be entered. to set up the password, simply change password in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please consider that this kind of image protection is very safe. for example, all images on the hard disk and for others can only be read or delete it on the file index.xml; this type of password protection is not used for those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to have a look on private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you have all your images with & kphotoalbum; manage to describe them and hours over hours you want to describe it. for this reason you have to look at some time. because of this reason you have a picture _ and video viewer. you can see from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. he naturally shows the image, but additional information you have to enter about the image, e.g. who is on the image, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the InfoBox in the upper part of the picture you can see, so you can also configure the mouse and follow what information is displayed. all these options are displayed on a right click on the viewer. then, the menu text menu can be seen down below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click on this browser, see the search entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures from Anne Helene. as if you had selected a person from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer you can switch between them and back, by using the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer you can run this as a slide photo. then you can select a new picture after a few seconds. how frequently it can be done by pressing the Ctrl button and Plus or minus. starting and stopped the slide show from the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the beholder of & kphotoalbum; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. just use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can use in the image and zoom out in the image. with the mouse, you can use a rectangle. with the mouse button, you can zoom in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the balance of the zoom, the zoom on the screen corresponds to an image of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">NOTE that the only Zoomoperations can work with videos that are both in and out with Plus- and Minutaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the background features from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make a comment on the image gallery observations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can see pictures, that you will find a picture with a person whose name will have you forgotten on the image. in the moment you can see the view and configure the configuration dialog of the picture to mark this name. you will probably submit only the picture to select and see further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see what pictures you want to see on paper. to see what photos you want to start with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you watch one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer will give you the opportunity to view images with features, while you see them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the respective letters. in case you see a picture where the features of A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set characteristics on your pictures, you can see them in your browser. if you have selected all the images you need, print or whatever you have selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in front view. if you can view the categories in Dre front view, then you can simply add the characters for the feature when the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on an image. for this case you can paint & photo album on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted value is not saved with the image, but in the database. on the way you can undo your own mixture later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In an image you can see a painting on the painted text box. on the painting you can draw on the painting from the context menu. to finish the painting menu, simply select the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to control the application of the program & Povray; not fully rule, but the documentation on & Povray; you should have read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties below and the object in the wire- displays yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object as all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If possible positions, the following menu will be inserted, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar, or from the context menu from the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have properties, click on to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with a error listing. then, you can rectify the input files and reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution program you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 provides already the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">In case you edit a texture or a part of texture, you can see a preview of the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press a preview in the attribute painting and a little example of the scene is structured by the chosen text, even if you want to render an arranging element (for example a texture in a texture map and not the whole texture map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot showing the camera control points. you can draw these control points with the mouse, thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points and it becomes displayed a small cross in the wire model. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation and the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual acuity. you can specify this value relative to visible visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. Objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order as default. the object tree and the view of the property properties are left and the four graphical displays on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard shutdown or if you need any other arrangement you can also store several windows arrangements and easily switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To view a window over or under one existing view, drag the beginner to the upper or bottom edge of a view. rectangle will then show the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange multiple views over each other, drag the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views on the map plates above on the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchor, drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the top left at the top of the above arrow in the beginnings.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the kasserbar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu View, you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can be anchored at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save a window on window... save. it will display a dialog box where you can save the windows of windows under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to rendering this program was & Povray; 3.5 at present. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the symbol Rendering The symbol rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. he determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you wish to insert a scene in different formats and quality levels, you can supply many render modes, from a fast preview up to Full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the symbol The Render Settings in the toolbar or select in menu View modes... select the following dialog is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can input any name, but it is useful to recognise the properties of the mode.</seg>

<seg id="1041">Drop down in combination quality you can select the properties that are used by a very simple colour and light model. this goes by a very simple color and light model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. you will find a detailed description of the Render properties available in the user's guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is generated with only one ray per pixel. these images are often displayed in curves and lines, sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses an technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this property is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch off Anti-Aliase, calculating & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super sampling. the standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling is reversed; recursively recursively, because every pixel is split again and adaptively it depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray plays a beam according to the set-value pixels with super sampling. if you need a grid value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, if you have a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 radials per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixels is split into 4 sub-pixel size, which can be individually tested and adjusted to further underlines. the maximum depth of the rewinding can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another option to reduce the alasing effect is that the creation of hiss for the ray process, called jittering. when you turn on Jittering, the rays vary around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it is very long to calculate the diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long way to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels is calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated Rays has no object.</seg>

<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to follow any more precise knowledge of both programs. if you're able to set the ultimate but simple scene, the ultimate but simple scene is very popular: a bullet on one layer.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you decide to use just a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for the rendering will be applied as a result.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't include lighting sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have anything wrong, you see at the first start of & kpoveteler; the following pre-set window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the Toolbar. please read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">These menus and symbols are to be used frequently, so you should remember menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object too. select the scene and select the menu entry Edit. thus, you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model-view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you produce. in particular, it is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows the result of the scene in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The slide tree is now a new entry with the name of the camera. when it click on it, you can find the contents of the view, where the various parameters of the camera will find. in the user documentation on & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything about the basic settings of camera, this is later that you can change the camera in the view control point, with which you can change the camera in the camera. simply click on the left button on a Control Point, and drag him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button or press the input button, the wire model views and the object tree can be adjusted instantly with these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could set for example a fader (insertion body quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a complete method for resolving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; is actually a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model-view now displays the level, even if at the moment only as a limited level. if you render the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you watch the object too, you'll find that you can see the entry for the bottom fold. in this case you will only see the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizontal axis, so you can get to know some of these parameters. choose the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just pick up the floor to introduce its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something flat at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog is where you can select as the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the property table. you can see the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with one click on the button Preview you see, as pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course the preview of pigments only need a matt black material, because you need to check your material yet with a click on preview. also, you can always try to check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many options, but take the simplest one now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see a color on quader or bullet, just click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is right now. if you render your image now with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course this is not the colour that you have expected. here, you need to enter two new attributes. in the color list, you will need to do two new attributes. then, select this entry twice (you can also do so frequently, but the board game list can only be used with two colours):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree jedesmal kind and change the colors in the view of the property properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already simply run this step as you should already have the basic working method of & kpoveteler; it is as easy as the ball can be created just like the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the bottom of the property properties you can change the value for the radius: on 1 (please do not forget the input button or the button to apply), so the ball is suspended over the bottom. otherwise, the ball would float to the floor for a unit.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering is now a strange result: as previously to see, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put it in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now prove your material now. as with the bottom, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first subobject and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on sphere Pigment, select then used and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects, if you take time to introduce some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following image maps and click on using or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of gloss effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal is not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of that which offers you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned a lot that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is an ender method to create a two-dimensional scene of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you ravises a scene raytracen, renegame the renegotothic rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflect the scenes) as this beam is reflected in the scene and as atmospheric effects, such as fog effect. thus the scene is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, the camera will see without a camera, the camera is yours eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you can see anything, the picture is just black. obviously needs each scene, which should be ripened, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>

<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump-Map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: highly complex 3D models are produced by dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>

<seg id="1482">It opens the settings of & K3b; here, general program settings will be made. almost all functions of & K3b should work for a job. this dialog is intended to personalize and recompassing the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is how many others & kde; applications are also equipped with a & DCOP; -Interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical to your taste and the type of your task is crucial, what the crucial program you can take advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we suppose that you can use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions you have to make sure that & K3b is started. then, then give a bit like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have created all & kde; program measured, supported & K3b; mainly two more parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The DCOP interface of & K3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatDVD and further functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPref createDataCDProject () DCOPRef CreateMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef CreateMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () void copyDvd () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the Project by using # dcop K3b K3binterface currentProject By using this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface that applies only to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString Name) void createFolder (QString Name, QString Parent) void removeItem (QString path) void flameItem (QString path, QString earlier Name) void setuumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it is possible to fill out a script project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders, and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3binterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT-Url / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -reader for & kde; with it can be easily read audio CD; also read and in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on the hard drive) and of many codiers (unlossy). currently, lame packages must be installed from the Linux distrum. further codiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (unfunnier and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) compresses in the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats such as the lossy-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia is put together. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package, if this is not installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), OggVorbis (for OGG) or other codec have already been installed, but it is probably not necessary to compile anything up to yourself. if the code is not needed, the installation is not necessary, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which Kodierer- / file format will be used? the text Welcher Kodierer is a small introduction about codierer, audio quality and composition factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; it is not possible to crack the audio CD; it is not possible to avoid any copy of the CD; it is not possible to avoid any copying system. even avoid the mechanisms of head protection. avoid the purchase of copying-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once a suitable setup (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration), after a suitable configuration you will be read on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) for understanding for the slim approach of the user interface that will be stumbling at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert many formats - depending on which codec programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; take information from FreeDB from the Internet or can work completely without network, where all can be recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a quick list of the master's commands. on the page you find more information such as this program is used as well as screenshot with descriptions of the program tab.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different map types (like encoder, for setup of the encoder). here you need to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter includes sound quality, codiers and compression ratios and helps you select the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are also others like 'shorten' or 'monkey' which may not be available for this distribution. the cons are the low compression ratios and barely any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Amongst the audio formats, we lose information through data compressed depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG files today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important, as both codiers are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distribution channels, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High up to high quality quality (at high speed rates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - When only music belongs to a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for audio quality and resulting from resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setup gives good transparency to most people and the most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset Standard '= This setting should usually offer more transparency to most people and most of the music pieces of acceptable transparency and has already high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR, common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. well enough for music from youths, portable devices and autostereoids. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you really want to see the absolutely highest quality without consideration to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which can be inserted into the program or automatically fetched from the FreeDB file via the Internet are available as a list of parameters. you can commit / needed to create and used with & kaudiocreator; and to create the program name and the code name and the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodierers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the jigures (in english) If MP3s with lame will be added if MP3s must be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result will be added as: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that are needed (= buttonhole in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDB is: a free database, in which persons can read / enter the information, so that all the other information can be downloaded from oneself in the computer, so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself: & CD; Title, Artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm. des Ueberaner) is not attorney. however, no one can find out the public on the & CD; however, no one can be found out by the & CD; any more or less worthless, so it can be obtained from the artist yet by a & CD; shop, physical or virtual ones.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; it is active to select a checkbox (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it does not seem to use the e-mail address when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator is setup; the topographic will be used to use the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and displays the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to Freedb.org will provide a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; for information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database can be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which makeup program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There's rumours that the cdparanoia will be used, seeking out in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package must first be installed first if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the read WAV files, the Kodierer can and thus select the desired file format. in the first opening you are selected for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data). other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution to be used before encoders. this is also necessary for the pre-defined codiers. further information about codiers are in the chapter World Codierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Following the installation of a Kodierers you can get more information about his switches as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive on it and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio-codiers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. they might run on both programs with a command line in a terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-in audio CD; check out the pouch of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step for example. even if you use other settings, this can give you tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the whole manual, but you're still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by step for example, and you'll get enough information to set up the program what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all setup and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 jigures (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">The cdparanoia and lame must already be installed on your computer. both programs should be found as a compile packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, what you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have a write permission on it (eg by trying to copy the queror somewhat in the queror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set of & kaudiocreator; something which is thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; for each exiting & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here, we specify the resulting codiers to compression the music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps), and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program with the FreeDB to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we're not likely to change their settings at any time, if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is provided to the reading program to read the & CD; read data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can be supplied, so a glance into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to use the existing entries for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here are not much to do. here, an additional conversion will be defined. in our example it will be shown as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information please ask, so you will be informed when data about jigwords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map CD; -Settings. just select both items. we are convenient and allow the & CD; data to automatically download the Internet from a FreeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">NOTE: the machine must be connected to the read out of the & CD; allowing the internet to access the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry found, begins immediately with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, can be easily changed with the database entry and the tag / filename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, this example is further to be observed when you wish to enter the selection boxes and FreeDB. however, you can download the selection boxes and FreeDB. however, you can download it twice if you're worthwhile. in order to use FreeDB in offline use, the two selection ranges has to be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map segment.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDB. these are settings for the data enquiry, for retrieving the & CD; for information from FreeDB server about the Internet. as white the system, which data will be given to the CD? read it all the way it is shown in the screenshot above.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page Freedb.org and take a look at a mirror server in your area. on this way the load is spread between the computers. this setting is however first to work.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalently as the server concerned, because many firewalls will boast the protocol 8880 as standard, there are usually more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surd on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transfer & CD; data to the FreeDB server; the first checkbox should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the file / tmp is defined on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously disfigured pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one of the same time with only one existing drive? paralleles reading and coding? the author knows not to try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: tick it around & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom files for temporary files: when you cross it, then the path / folder can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored, if only space is installed on another drive. if you don't forget the files in private files, if you don't want to make them something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All this as it is on the screenshot above. the command is slightly long, under circumstances, something must be blinded according to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--Preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting output factor is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. it is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">NOTE the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted. in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of entry file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in screenshot. some comments on future use outside of this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: with a dual core or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be attempted to decode more than a WAV file.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic furnishings of & kaudiocreator; it is used as a standard for each read out of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described, as is described in the previous section as the process of the reader was set up and set up. first, we will create a connection to the internet, as we are comfortably and the & CD; data from the FreeDB will be picked up. the process of the process is described in this section, must be repeated for each exiting & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in FreeDB, the screenshot can be a little different from the data for a & CD; therefore you will learn how to remove the & CD; data instead of retrieve them from the Internet. comments will refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done so now the & CD is; into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a brief moment, the pieces and length in the window should be listed as in the screen. this only if the & CD; can be identified as audio CD; can be identified and from cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, check the questions and answers by the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been collected from FreeDB, all pieces of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case it is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there is a window built-in, and you can select the database entry that fits your opinion the best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have selected the check box for automatic query by FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings for the settings), you can also dissolve this manually by selecting the first button. if you don't have a local database, it will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2-02: the CD editor - entering the CD's data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen screenshot. the title of the piece in the first row of the input field 'updated title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be given no more in the input field 'news Title' unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for single comments invalidation. the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Warning: after the successful demand of the data from the FreeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to see the content of the CD editor, so you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. either all words with letters of letters or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted notes.</seg>
<seg id="1588">NOTE: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the tab character settings; let it take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all Kodierers or file formats. check the codiers in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, which is obviously unlocked with the style of the exiting CD; this example is not important because we will not transfer the & CD; -Data anyieso. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for instance will be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK "you get back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD-editor's window appears again and you'll see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have gathered for the first piece. simply give the title of the item in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure click the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Warning: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from the FreeDB. it is sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. NOTE that the artist and the album are displayed on the board.</seg>
<seg id="1597">NOTE that there is a check-in before each line of each line. only the titles are selected. simply click on the line the choice of the piece is selected, or fill the button All tracks on the lower edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button selection read the reading process, this window appears to be acknowledged. click OK and then we will create a look at the window with the proceeds and track what goes.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider's request to turn off on the order window. it's in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the jobs. the first piece is currently read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you will notice if you are trying to work with a coding, which you don't have to have been successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the client list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we checked here in the example. did you checked if you have typed on the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first stage.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: mission 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and coding in parallel. NOTE the status at the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found any configuration settings to read this behaviour. the use of parallel processes is unclear. the use of the parallel processes is unclear. the used machine with a AMD64 appears to read and code (from however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while a different piece will be coded and a third order in the waiting area is added, a small window will be added with a message for a short while in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. respectively 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoders of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are recorded in the series. in this section, how to use collection of files.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the point. click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You may also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection is included at the beginning the same songs as the original.</seg>

<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be stored. remember when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In order to add songs to a collection, you have to add a song in the collection Manager. there is again the file dialog, with which help you can choose the song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the settings for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatically activated the collection, a piece can be added automatically by opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add the collection to the collection, the opening of a piece will be activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you'll need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song, then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series after the menu sequence of menus, the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you are adding songs or remove any random order in the menu, the order will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song for a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list over the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button next song, the next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back to jump, select the button pre-piece, the record previous piece of the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button deletion.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection could not be deleted. however, this does not play a role when leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events can be translated into events that the synthesizer is understandable.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to Trumpet and thus getting a trumpet sound if originally playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are compatible (including AWE - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Sorry, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. therefore, you have to edit the hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that saves all the required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear before the KEYMAP section, which is so often appear as desired. the prerequisite is, but each occurrence is a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... I define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END OF KEYMAP... Find a further Keymap... END OF CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define it is needed to indicate that one section begins (except options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how the patches sent from General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal name is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all sounds that require this instrument to set the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not used for example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which should be similar to like a tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if you should play a MIDI file with patch 127 (Rifle), it'll take Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the clay 60, regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the term drum patch is shared with the term drum patch of patch, where every tone is a different percussion instrument (Drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the sound level of the ever same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as their presence. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use several names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to run tones on the percussions canal. watch as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be needed to deduce some channels to another. if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply do it in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is depicted on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, it will be able to use the keymap with the name Name for this channel. if you are ignored by the Forcepatch option, you will need to change the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio is identified, in which ratio of Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied with the value of n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file doesn't stop as decimal.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM provides a keyboard to play a pitch-playing event with the value 4096, a sound greater than playing. unfortunately, some keyboards will try to play two tones for up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find them in the menu on Settings, point MIDI-settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The Channel view is a window with a whole range of Klaviets (one for each MIDI channel). on this manual you see which sounds can be played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel to change the instrument on a specific channel. if you have changed a select list where you can select a instrument. if you have an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played sounds. in the menu, select Settings under the point of Channel: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you, e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows turn left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about it, like a music piece. it contains the music, the pace, speed, & etc;. thus the same MIDI file can be played on two different devices, just like two different musicians who can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can not only force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file requires around 50 KB, while a mp3-file requires a similar sound quality. in addition to a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, DEB) by & kmid; to fix it. to eliminate the problem, you have to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, therefore Supported & kmid; Drag & Drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Once you need to add the automatic shift to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow key on the left from the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the pace, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop work with my MIDI files and & kmid; if I play a MIDI file (if I play a MIDI file) or hips (if I play a MIDI file) or I'd like to play a file only in the & konqueror; -window switch and the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only, without adding them to a collection, turn off the Automatic add to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us take you, you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. you only want to play the first file. so, select your automatic file to the collection and open your temporary collection then it contains exactly these MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people were sent to me MIDI files or postcards. all thanks! if I see these songs or watch the postcard, animated me to program further to & kmid;.</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the videoforlinux is also supported for the X server. therefore, it must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

The narrable & latex; orders for the division are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The drop down selector is available for articles such as keywords, Fuels, nodes or links. the available methods are:</seg>

<seg id="1776">The brackets for the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the text can not be determined by default. if the font is not defined at the beginning, this can also be done in text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code text sample has to be compiled, & latex; source code is compiled. the simplest way is to use the operation of building or the button.</seg>

<seg id="1780">An area (English) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the written format will have been created and only a few SÃ ¨ s will have a different font. the command\\ etc.\\ end {environment} encourages the opening of the writers in the environment - the Riesigâ s. (in English).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The subsidies will be reserved only within the area (from\\ oration {environment} to\\ end {ks}). there are no evidence (number) for the shipping within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many MÃ ¶ nications to ease your readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, substracts, substracts, substractions, etc. they can either be added to the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {empt}: this command is for the cursive pressure and is as long as GÃ ¼ ltig, until it is closed with a\\ end {empt} or another environment. one single word in one sentence can be shown with\\ senh {word}.</seg>

<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source code with & latex; label language, follows now a step-by-step instructions for the creation of a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a bit text was entered, there should be a quote for the better readability of the document. these should be mind. a quote, a few positions in the grease and a poem to the application, to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be reprinted by editor-view or Strg E (on the internal viewer). at an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a file format file format (engl. D e V ice I nv). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi output as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -Conversion or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps are as for how to view the document (see). when the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar exchanged the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; -source code has been created, the conversion should begin with the KnÃ ¶ PFE in the toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="1800">Handful users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to nearly all documents. templates are created in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate creating a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you need to create an existing & tex; - / latex; file format or a new file created. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and choose from the template of document.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, using a new document, some string chains replaced by other data (i.e. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in ways to set up settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">To create your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which character strings of which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be substituted by entering the category class:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and that is related to the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps has been finished:</seg>

<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. it is necessary to create a simple way to create a template, should be performed by one on the Internet and performed in described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the MÃ ¶ AND of many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & BibTeX;). many editings for & Kate; can be made out of menu item directly from & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about Kate and Kate's guide, the handbook should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; here you can start with reading the chapter of Beauty by the Editor & Kate.</seg>

<seg id="1816">The work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & kile;. although & Kate; already offers great items for writing. & latex; always supported many environments and groups and therefore under their choice. under special features, the following commands are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">If a text is made out of (group of lines, which contain on both sides of a blank lines). this extended importance is not a text with pertinent lines. this extended importance is not a text, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source. the only beucleated thing in & kile; is that the query can be separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">If the word has been made under the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning, since this command is also bodilatex; orders with an area (*) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For drawing a part of this document, it can be removed by pressing the button Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers the whole line. & kile; offers with its own commands this includes the following commands to read the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removed a complete paragraph. definition of a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of editing the paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been noted that environments are a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for NF further commands under control and for a great simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, at the beginning of the current area (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command triggers to the end of the current area (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the structure of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is begin before or within the command\\ E. {surroundings}, the end of the environment will be injected to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">At the input of many flinated ambient conditions can be lost quickly to the opening statements. this command will be able to denounce the last environment, so that the missing environment structure could not be refunded.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups, which are determined by staples {...}. among others TeX group are some important commands given to those of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, the cursor is placed at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the ruffered clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command triggers to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the slipped clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is off or behind the pinned clamps of a & tex; -group # is located, then the other end of the group is injected (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">At the input of many loose groups of clamps, the group clamps can be lost too soon. this command stopped the last group, so that the missing structure of the & tex; groups can not be clocked.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple adjustments are used as GÃ ¤nsew. for the purpose of execution, the sign is used in & kile; the sign is suitable for two simple instructions. for this case, the sign is suitable for two simple adjusting characters for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic set-up for double support can be set under settings Kile... LaTeX can be set up and power.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french), and thus can be used as a lot of other languages too.</seg>

<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages supported by DTD-agnostic and webbased formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are available via the Settings menu. here are only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for others can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up with Settings Quanta... This dialog is extended to a few pages that are covered in succession.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; concerning tags including autocompaction can thus be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lower friction of tags: large / small storage of automatically added tags. normal large / inflography means, the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / inforthography of automatically added attributes. normal child / inflography means, the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if hact, is optional for tags that is optionally available for the final day, that is right after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not optional tags automatically include: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the starting and end day: if it is switched on, the corresponding day will be changed and inversely.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic creation of accent elements: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding encoding during the typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes to identify different types of files. using the standard, the default specifications can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or embedded files (where the encoding of the file may be passed), but this setting is thrown by the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files that DTD is not detected, but this setting is excluded from the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; created regular backup copy, allowing for a power failure or crash when the program is recovered from this backup. this is not the same as storing the file. also, a backup is regularly updated, according to the set time produced.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed in the editor of editors or a view (or documentation within a map series) which makes it possible to view the preview and the source code simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings on the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through modifying the MDI modes and andocks / suspend views of views. it corresponds to the --resetworm command parameter parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area serves taxes of the possibility to disable warnings of warnings from no more inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behaviour of & VPL; it may display the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source code view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structural tree, which represents the picture of the parser node in the document, can be discontinued in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structural tree, the following action is possible to change by clicking on the ground floor with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structural timber settings, visibility of tree is automatically opened to the tree and how deeply in a change of structural tree is automatically opened, empty spaces are to be adjusted, while empty groups are found in which no element found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for defining abbreviations (a type of templates) that are dissolete with resignaled text. abbreviations are valid in groups, each can be considered for several & DTEP; it means a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause abbreviation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here, the plugins can be managed. plug-ins are actually used by third page, which can be used by any part of the application, the most well known & konqueror;. when inserting a plugins, the following must be:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not on a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will open the plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the current file (path of current file) or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in the "Only-Read" mode: check if the plugin is refused to load the plugin. just-read-KParts does not deny the load if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is activated, then testet & quantaplus; whether the specified information is correct. then, if the plugin is not available in the moment the plugin is not available, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the bug-search was completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger. instead, a debugger-Plugin concept was implemented, which allows different implementations on plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, supporting the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; add.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger-plugins in the Project Properties. the Options button next to the debugger-Plugin provides the specific settings.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the contents of supervised variables. normally appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed normally. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view, where the output is shown (as in HTML) of the debuggers. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debuggers all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, or it shares the plugin with, on debug rules if a project is opened if a debugger that doesn't have to be respected on it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart of Debugging Session Start the meeting. includes the connection to the debugger or terminates the leaves.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP request to the server to include a Debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is shown in the debugger Edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger, with the execution of the script and the currently led line continuously. if this happens while the script is done, the execution proceeds before a debugrequest has begun, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger, with the execution of the script, without informing the variables and the current line number if this happens while a script has been given before a debugrequest has been given, the execution starts as soon as a request has been made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next prescription in the script, without running into the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next prescription in the script if possible in functions and includes faults.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Shows the debugger that the order to go and go to the next way, as would it not be the current.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog box where a variable or expression can be input which is monitored. the monitored value appears in the compilation view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can set a variable, or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter explains how you can customize & quantaplus; to adapt to your needs and how you can and quantaplus; can help you get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editors (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; therefore, to give support for markup- and scripts. they enable & quantaplus; ability to give ease and flexibility; for fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developer, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are in two ways, family 1, the characters and family 2, the script languages and family 2, the script languages and the toolbars. day folder contain two file types, the text and descriptionrc; and dialogs of image buttons (above the additive-window), insert text and instructions faster in a document called one user ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be prepared (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see in for details on the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create XML files, create & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the content and content of the proprietdialoges, the & quantaplus; file holds the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars enable a fast insert of tags in a document without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are not known as a folder. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the day XML files. tag folders bear the name of the read-language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML "and declare whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use so many as possible to allow other users a better viewing and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes any element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits will be made in an easy way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an day XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but does not contain a just element type above themselves otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The tag type is a script function. when using is & lt; attr &gt; One argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the day type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Just valid for the Type Method. returns the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within these tags can be added to any other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describing a attribute of a tags. this element can only appear once for each attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed, and etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source of source codes for attributes in day-Editordialog and tribute tree to the attribute dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; will be used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodName within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cutting and one process name. the arguments given to the method. can be empty or% tagless%, which means the name of the current Tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of attribute within a dialog box within a dialog. this tag can only occur in a dialog only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and the size of a field in dialog. this tag should be available for each field in dialogue (e.g. one for each & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements which occur within the specified tags. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is a just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All diXML files must begin with a & XML; -Decleation starts: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neat and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; sign. these should be done by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsany &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To verify the XML files, the tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; -window to start and check out TagXMLM. another dialog is published, whose simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, checking only when charging the daily XML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">An example of a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; Schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -Schema. the filename for this day XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">An example of a functioning family 2 day XML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this day XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor, accessible via DTD function. thus, you can be diedescriptionrc; for a new created & DTEP; for a new created & DTEP; it should be created with a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD indication. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set up with Settings... created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut of this promotion. with clicking the user button, a keeple button can be assigned. with Keiner, the current keyboard shortens is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The easiest actions. it can be inserted into the detailed settings and with execution of this text, this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action yp. using the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which are started or as input (or parts of the document) are started. examples from & the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is advisable to use the% scripting variable in command line, such as sh are scripting / myscript.sh. In this way, try to find the script: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of current document. in the case of a local document, file is removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; -process replaced. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is used only if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script can receive input from & quantaplus; the default input can be adjusted. in the drop down dialog, the default input can be specified. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected field of the document is sent to the script. usually, the% input variable is normally useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, also the output of the executed application can be directed. there are two types of output: normal output, based on the standard output. it can be specified, which is set to the default output by default output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in this case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once you have added a toolbar, you need to add or configure any actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are fairly self-explanatory. press the new action at the bottom end of the window starts working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Fill out all and if the day attributes has and you are planning to use the dialog box, call dialog, if available for entering the action of action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit. choose from the & kmenu;, graphics More programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used standard 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol is not only helps you to notice what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered as silly, rigid, further interpreted; it should be drawn; it is ready; it is ready; - day in the current document).</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol you need to be connected with the action. this happens on the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is, select it and confirm by OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and commit them with other tags, so it still gives, or confirm you with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some common & quantaplus; functions to the tool bar and it should be able to adjust the tool to better overview with some differences in multiple groups. make sure that the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (on top left) for my toolbar. after choosing the element it is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to add a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separator will support the grouping. anyone, who doesn't know my tool bar, could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by giving all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">If NeueXML is not existing, it will be setup imbal files, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) is required (will) if a file is opened by the according type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language which you like most. this is why I describes a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check back the & quantaplus; -repository, if anyone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search a existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then, you must create the docrc file. we'll have to tell you the first part we'll be treated here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements described in the Main Index Top element = your description for such documentaries such as & PHP, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag.html tag2 = tag.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, check out now in the & PHP; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 operating system = Table of Contents, # Getting started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">NOTE that # In front of Getting started and Language Reference. it shows that it is not known for subfolder in a tree with its own content. there is no known border for the battlesbids (except through the extermination) mdash. but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">NOTE that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consequently) at the top end of the top view & mdash; directories is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resp files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The document section is the range of the docrc file, which is intended to be displayed by using a & PHP; scripts for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by pressing the function and pressing the documentation here. there are only two types of entries here: the context menu (ContextList) and the file downloadable.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of written context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to save and either to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (such as docrc code and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these well and it is worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation is used to the & quantaplus; -repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud of being involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the discripts resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with promotions, scripts, templates) to others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send via email to friends, partners or else by whom you send an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email ship, in context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all others & quantaplus; -users can be downloaded and only available when our team is considered a correct and useful for publishing, if our team does not provide a GPG / PGP key, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are in demand for your private GPG key (the passport cannot be saved), or in the case you have to look for several key. in the dialog New resource you need to stay longer (URL preview can be empty) and starting with OK the uploading process will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), Toolbar, Toolbar, and in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource is warned and the signation. if the integrity, and the resource is given accurate and the resource is correct, appears as a result with the indication of the urine of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; it is necessary to work by adding a DTEP package. it gives the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be used from DTD store and converting a DTD menu. then select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target version name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitive header: the string used in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after the conversion: if activated, brings & quantaplus; after converting & descriptionrc; -editor, with details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these concepts and powerful benefits from & quantaplus; so you must first try to close these concepts with these fundamental concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided in three areas: global, locally and projector. this differentiation affects a range of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. of toolbars over actions, it is stored in the joint folder structure of & quantaplus; it allows the group of administrators to secure action to secure actions and patterns in a global tree, which will then be available in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. this is user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all of & CSS; - patterns can be customized for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which are supported by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the module's window with information and the tool. please contact in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Click to click into a context menu with the right mouse button, to reload a context menu with the current document possible, reload, delete or uploading of the document, jump into bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to present the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editorregion lead to another context menu regarding the revised document mode, such as basic machining steps (cut / copy / paste), the word below the mouse pointer or opening the file, when the string is described under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editorfensters you are currently using & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard to which a set of tool will be shown. in the course of the further extension of tools, the toolbar will be adjusted to the new features and thereby connected user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, for example & lt; in your document, you should insert the date for that just added day. now, you can insert a day that fill several attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The components (QIT;) enable it to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate to open and play through. in the presentation with boxes, document systems, scripts, attributes and documentation components are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by far right click. actions as adding, remove, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website and etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which it can be used in which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the respective users and templates are available in the project. more on templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, local and project works well here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can call the available information to a script. via the right mouse button, you can start writing, edit or send your script via email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on it, the cursor is placed on the position of the element. by the right-clicking an element it opens a list of commands regarding navigation and rhints of the tree.</seg>

<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development. you can create documentation site for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation and supported by adding a folder in doc, editing and viewed a project.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two card drivers at the bottom end of the window can be achieved - the user window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This card holder shows information on each in Quanta running script. such as the DTD of the current document and all changes are displayed for DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This card guides shows all mistakes in the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bar are extensively expanded and easy to understand. they are shown on a symbol and they receive the according command. the chocolate is able to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; send the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & KMail. if it has received a toolbar in an email, you can secure them in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable when you want to construct the site of the & quantaplus; to adjust files on your system. for example, autoconf you can pass a number of options that can be configured to configure the configure script. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting from & quantaplus; you should check if your path no. 3 am folder. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of her bin Folders. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a large powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort, the best & HTML; editor to create, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an exceptional idea, what if & quantaplus; a standalone, extendable up-language editor would be? well, this would do it for the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML, limited, is & quantaplus; now already on the way to a general and extensive web development tool. summarize, if you can define it into & XML; then, & quantaplus; therefore should be & quantaplus; therefore suitable for the application / IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above mentioned claim must be said that & quantaplus; follows that, in good use of free software, the idea of what anyone has developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffold, not only this is possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; so to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows Webdevelopers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). it can expand the productivity of virtually any task. by using the program compression and tools, they can clearly know without any executable language syntax.

<seg id="2125">If using bookmarks in the current file, it will appear in the menu with entries of previous or next, depending on the cursors position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents in the menu will be grouped according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presenting a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory according to new files that could be there. this allows for example to add video files into your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded other input modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled up at the top of the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information can be automatically set up later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. in the input name, file will be completed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; -project file. by default, it has stored the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine, to which you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.ample.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets use this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocols are used. depending on the remote computer, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a common collection of files used for different projects, this file should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects, this file should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local filesystem. you can be selected multiple files or entire folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and modify the static web site, you can download and modify. when using server script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed in a different manner.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Act-act when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be bound. if a project is started anew, it is not obliged.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the folder and you can make a precise selection of the crew.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files through investors, or by removing the tick, from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings which can simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded with Project Properties in the menu of the menu in the menu window profile or using the CTRL Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some flags will correspond to those in the project assistant, and are explained in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder is possible), which are ignored in project operations like project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, even files that are listed in .cvsignor are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project. can be read more about project prospects.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The desired debugger can now be selected. it is currently only supported by Gubed. the debugger-Plugin can be used with the Options button. the debugger that is described in the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindows profiles uploading, high load profiles (see in) can be adjusted as well as display of a module for the contents of the server for each profile by adding a separate building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Underwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. look for details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the lower window event configuration, you can turn off event actions and add these actions, change or delete events. event actions are executed if a previously specified event occurs as to enrich in a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project was opened. this behavior can not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project open and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. they are asked if you want to save the changes before leaving, if you are expecting a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave likewise, however, the entries are opening and open... in the right mouse menu with the right mouse menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Different profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the site of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only a profile is available, the button is blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and is forgotten by programming. this option is useful if necessary uploading files is necessary and the more unsecure password from the disk will not be found in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog, if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-speed profiles can be created and thus uploaded the project (or parts of the project) to various servers. during editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your Angstion, this is either a time-saving function or danger. if your password is stored on the disk, it is not easy to read, but everyone with program knowledge can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded into a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view can be loaded, and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the menu or the project toolbar, reachable on Settings tool bar project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has most to do. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows customization of & quantaplus; to the own workings.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; most of the menu toolbars are available. use and add of tool to add in the section Add of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols are set to be set either by the context menu (right click on the toolbar), other actions such as tool bar can be performed which can be performed in the dialog, where indicated in the dialog, where can be specified, which actions will be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a tool (symbol) on a tool bar, the entries will remove the promotion and action, which are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool... and adjustments actions set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in key document chain, code-carving and files for linkway. & quantaplus; uses templates, like a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces. you can copy, move it or any system existing in the locality. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you have to push for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not purer text. it can be included any file apart from text, i.e. images, & PDF; b, Flash files & etc; binary lists in documents by means of links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are usually found in the stock tree under global templates. other information on templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text documentation. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be generated in accordance with the purpose and organizes work in this way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the stock tree under global templates. look for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates are useful when you should not include a new document based on a template, but the same text area is to be inserted into the documents. they can be found in the stock tree under global templates. see in for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder structure. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a documentation structure after application (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As a template. store your template down....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that occurred, you notice that (even if it is stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. watch in the lagtree under project paper.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file The template to store as a local / project template. alternatively, the choice can be easily drawn with pulling and put on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is simple: the file is just enough to copy the file. all file management functions can be used for it, such as pulling and disassemble or add the storage space of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can also select a file space or in the project files tree view onto a folder right and secure site template, and secure a name for the template and secure it. by default, it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project documentation allow a very target-oriented approach. you can insert header and footer, or dynamically with & PHP; create, create files or link with them. in addition, there is a few things to use templates in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The system structure in the sub-window templates is based on the files in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / Quanta / Templates and</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, click the folder with the right mouse button to select the folder and to select the text menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop down selector with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is low, once elterable attributes can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and if a regular folder would be enabled. if a regular folder would be enabled, it would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal order, the Blah would appear with something like text building block. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows using or presented text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footer for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents into a folder with special headlines / footer a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we have a context menu (press on the right mouse menu) via a complete command collection for adding folders, or copy and paste templates from a place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source text editor, which will be reachable via the menu View. the first mode is replacing the source code in two parts: the source code editor and VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: it invites you to edit a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then, you can edit and return the source code editor, where the performed changes are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document that contains PHP; it shows a small green symbol the Vohandenhy of & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; Editor is still the source code editor. there are no plans to alter such behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the VPL; -editor synchron. with pressures in the source code editor and in the VPL; this mode is already active, this mode is already active, if the button is maintained in a window to the others, where the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; -editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta and you can automatically choose between synchronization after a click or automatically. in the selection, the recommendation can be adjusted between synchronization after a single click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is a small fir for fast calculator and a large spoil for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, thus the editing of invisible tags in the work with the VPL; Editor is also called upon as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. thus, you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allows the storage of information about the document itself i.e. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed. one click into the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the lookout pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules to the list below the list or delete a change above the list is just as possible with the Meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by selecting the file and select the file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is as in a word processor, because of moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor is strange and the marking works as usual. text can be inserted as usual, and can be deleted by typing button or distances.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Pasting tags will be made in the same way about the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it is too aware that the insertion of tags is not removed if a anchor day, surrounded by text, each other must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tools like the tables wizard or the lists of wizard are disabled. they will work later on & VPL; work in this release, the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining styliances. in contrast to other programs, the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain how I was written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The assembling was very complicated, because one of the contributions had been made and simultaneously revising the rejection. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts while contributors.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by myself was only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no hints to the places where perhaps only the reversing was a small album.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences between one line and changes made to white signs. later, many more useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you would like to compare the text, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way interference will be fully supported if two persons are working independently in one piece encode and make changes in the same time. the collaboration Editor makes it possible. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor you can even edit the result by editing three quiz files at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you construct the comparisons and merge files. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; condensed by folder cocones:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and adjusted to the features of current color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, this can be seen at a glance at the viewpoint in the column at the left side. (no more offence changes.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicate which file is different. red color means that both differ to files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can facilitate the typing program by using only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 Folder 1 Ordner2 Folder 1 Ordner2 -o Zielordner kdiff3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 -o Zielordner</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual type of filenames to select the selection of a file browser (file...) or select a file in the next time. you will not specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders. if for A file is selected, for B and C, but uses & kdiff3; the file name from A to the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merge operation is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to specify a output file immediately. you can take this step even later.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup will open a dialog with settings. here, you can set options before you start with the comparisons / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes, you don't want to compare the file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard in the active comparison window. in the opening dialog, you do not need to select any files, you can easily connect the dialog with the interrupt button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and finish: just drag an file from a file or selected text from an editor and let it fall by a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar features. if you want to figure out how similar these features are, they would have to create two relevant files, they can easily copy and compare the relevant sectors. now, you can copy and compare the relevant sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2301">NOTE: currently you can't get anything from & kdiff3; only remove text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program as cutouts and paste (instead of copying and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text line there is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path is too long), you leave the mouse a while on line. then a small aid window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source parameters are assigned letters A, B and C, and the colour is blue, B the colour green and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is known, the color which file differs. if both files are different, the color scheme is red. (color for conflicts in the settings) is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (collapse) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the column column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. for some programming languages the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (by C / C + + for example, white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column in the text, where the respective source file has no lines. if the line file is activated, the line will be scored points.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison results) also has a info line with the inscription issue: the filename and [modified] if you have processed the result. usually it contains the automatic combination of text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all the conflict is dissolved, Save is disabled!!! (use buttons to next resolved / unsolved problems to find remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisers are used, every difference is to be solved at the same time a conflict of the manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will appear. this group will then be displayed.) This group is then highlighted the current group. it will be lifted with the color background color for current area and a black beam is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic compilation or through manual editing do not leave any other line more in the group; then this is only a placeholder for the case, that you may change your mind and perhaps again another source. this text is neither available in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you might copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; conservation conflict; however appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the earnings window. go gently with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">NOTE: if the selection of the sources list the options ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates will be navigated and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard buttons on the left, right, high, down, side down, top, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-end, see it as you can also use it from other programs. the supervised rip next to the vertical screen bar can also be used for navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">You can also use the other keys to edit the edit buttons. the insertion button lets you change between insertion and write-in mode. (voicing is the insertion setting mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary-columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already described in paragraph and explained the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl-top), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture downward) or to the next / previous unresolute conflict also after the manual solved. therefore, I need to resolve between dissolved and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, then whatever you select, automatically copying them to the clipboard. be careful, because you might have to copy the contents of the clipboard occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilentos are stored under the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-in value\, and Win32-based systems use spline-forward\\ r\. KDiff3 that you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of last used files will be stored automatically and in the next start. (menu entry - &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a writing with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog appears also with variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italic writing are displayed. if the chosen script does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Using only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be encoded. on these systems the button presets automatically introduces an ungerable color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, pressing the tab button the corresponding number of spaces inserted. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press or Return, the reset line will automatically be used to enter the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection automatically copies the clipboard. manually copy to the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-up type you prefer to store. the default value is the usual option on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files try & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step you can ignore white signs. the second step is not ignored. in this step white signs are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) Save as a line-in '\' at the end of a line, other in the end of a line, but you could only ignore a spline-forward symbol, but then you could be deactivated, but if this option is activated, this option must be disabled. during the compilation, this option must be disabled. in the default, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related character ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow to very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Auto-going mode, this setting, how long the outcome of the selection is displayed, before the next unresolute conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolve automatic all conflicts in white signs by default or if you need to use the selected file in many files. if you only require it from time to time, take advantage of the automatic selection of numbers in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ignorneys C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in chapter to scan folders and through a merge operation. look for details on the list of documentation regarding the directory and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .original exists if already any such backup file with the suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without any other backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">The language of the user interface does not fit the current running program. you need to finish and start the current running program. (this option is active in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is configured globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if one is activated, it is used for all entries the top adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2340">On the selection for the coding, a short notice appears that the local encoding is. (this can be changed from here and has an informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared to different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you edit a file, you can specify which coding for saving should be used here.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you do unobjectionable with your codec, you might possibly do not work with your codec. (e.g., your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the presentation program can only use 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn it on to suppress the changes made in white signs in text or considerations. (NOTE: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you see three files. in normal mode, you'll see only the differences between two of three files. after choosing A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C is next to the normal still a second transfer column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply connect the less important window. (this option is on the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">The comparison window can be useful by side or opposite. this can also be useful to display long lines (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, you consider the differences and make sure the files put together in conjunction with the file name. a simple click will start the file name and uses the file name for the output file. (if this function is used to launch the merge file, then the name of the last used file is retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be delivered into this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use it with your own processor. you can use this function for example to cut interference or correct the rejection.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first an external command. if the output command has been issued, the output command is only used in line. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds to your own processor. each input line must have a corresponding issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up Diff's results. however, the external message is needed, and most users don't want to program that in most cases are used or perl.</seg>
<seg id="2352">\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. *\\\\\\\\\\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 /' This.\\ U uses the found text in the first clammerncouple.\\ U transforms the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with a bet you might begin to understand and maybe you like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that do very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignore of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line equiv. used it / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and any hits is replaced by nothing, so quasi is deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple instances at once. then, you can use the semicolon ';' to separate them from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used, you can also use something else like for example perl. perl -p -e -e -e -e -e -e -e -e -e -e -e -e -e -e -s / /\\) needs perl only (and) without the specified '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">Data after the normal preprocessor are retained for displaying and to merge together. further operations are only changing the data, the equilibrium Algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">NOTE: in rare instances if you use a normal preprocessor, the ZeilenabbalUnit considers the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text is altered or differences, you can't notice some differences in the worst case and destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare and merge a complete folder with & kdiff3; complete folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal to assemble a proposal; you can customize the proposal from the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and simulate the simulated changes, without having to conduct them?</seg>
<seg id="2364">... executes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only using selected objects (F6-key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparisons and merge of single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are assembled, folder 1 is used as base. if no target folder was specified, & kdiff3; Ordner3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">NOTE that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, do not start the merge. to press the merge, you need to select the respective menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform a small news window over the current progress. if you break the scanning of folders, only the files are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folders comes complete, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder given during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded together. you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the bottom. the directory contains two subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or damper all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, file size will be launched and a comparative window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first file (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window at the chosen object. in such a case, the compilation action can not be chosen automatically. if merging it will be notified, you will be informed of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, you are used in the columns A / B / C colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, with identical entries the colour is also identical even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder are considered as identical if your total content is identical. then folder also have the same color. by folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red is going red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, clear the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A file and B is a file): error: contradictory data file types. as long as such faulty objects may exist, the collapse cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if A file and B is a file): error: contradictory data file types. as long as such faulty objects may exist, the collapse cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two files and no explicit target can be synchronised. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action resulting thereafter as a result is identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not the same as: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B; copied straight after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are assembled, select the new file instead of merge (uncertain), but then examining the newer file. if the files are different, but the date is different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not removed, the collapse of the folders can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While consolation, a file will be dismissed by the other hand, if the merge operation was successful, and correspond to other messages, if the merge has been concluded, you should take a last review and see if the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file setup dialog is selected, KDiff3 will display further columns. these include the number of unsolved, unsolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for deleted conflicts will only be displayed when compared to three folders.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either guide the just selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all interveil promotions (in all subfolders), you can run the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, you will be used as a target in the three-file merge mode C as a target; it is used as a target and in synchronizing A and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder, and there are some options due to the specific entries could be skipped. check these options to avoid unloved surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring together all the entries, select directories or continue through the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortens). to only bring to the current record: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory data file types still exist invalid interactions, a message appears to be displayed on flawed elements. you can select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you perform all entries, a dialog window will run through the options, Simpulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Just pick just what you would like to pass what would happen, without which really changes are made. you will then receive an extensive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then causes certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (assembled a single file), then a merge window will open (see the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select directories or continue F7. if you don't have saved, an equivalent dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you click on a mistake, you will find a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that you should try to try the cause of the problem. so, you can select a different action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you can proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually put together, notices and differs (in the current session) and directing them not together. even if the merge operation was done or not saved, these entries are considered as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be related again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Ktion 3...) now has a section called directory combination with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files which fit on the specified pattern is displayed in the element tree. separate samples with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is not correct this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element name. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original * .o.</seg>

<seg id="2404">Ignore files which are ignored by CVS. the main advantage is that this folder can be ignored by CVS. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystem files, files are hiding in a file system. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. when the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links shown. this is disabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the links are compared when the option is switched on, the links such as normal folders will be obtained. (NOTE that if the option is switched on), the links will result in a folder that would result in itself to a pin loop and if the option is switched off.) This option is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a full analysis of each file through and shows the statistic-columns. (the number dissolved, unsolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it does not contain any text. (fill in the anti-pattern)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large files to a slow network, it's possibly faster than to compare the changesion date and your file size. however, this speed does not cost you with caution. this option is automatically rolled out with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the changeset date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered as they are considered to be useful when copying the changesion date. please be careful when copying the date. this option is outdated.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronizing mode when compared to two folders, no target folder was specified. in this mode, the proposals will be evaluated. also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered insecure than the other file is not changed if the other file was not changed too.) This option is disabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file replaced by another file or deleted, the original version is renamed to .original If an old backup file with the .original extension is already existing, this applies even the normal combination of individual files, not only the merge recognition. this option is enabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder coaching View stays open to the collapse of single files; you can turn off the window splitter with your mouse. if you don't want to turn the windows in the window menu and switch off the windows directory between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply via double click. however, you can also use a file menu entry into the menu. once you use the file menu. once you save the result, the status is reduced to Erlease and the file will not be merged if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status, however, is lost when you agree to read the directory: -Menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line displays a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should notice:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relatively undis. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the used protocol. there is a quick list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder. then, a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or variable expiry date. therefore, the option to change or change date from the original. (this is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main use of use is currently the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop first begins to start the built-in differences in KDevelop. then select the right mouse over the differences-viewer and then select In KDiff3Part out of the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files; however, if it is used as a part, it takes a patch file in unified format. then, & kdiff3; the names of the original files must exist. then run & kdiff3; the patch for the missing file will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can select a Patch-file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. besides, it does not work if any of the original files exists. moreover, it is unreliable when the original files since creating the patch file has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merging or comparing of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now It is Compare), the name KDiff3 is already shown that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot of watching it in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who went on this way or going to go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You probably have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure command at KDE. in the presetting configure configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). find out more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs are different, these lines are slightly different than the same; but if only one non-white character is different, the line will not be treated as the same. IF (lines) next to each other, this cis co.but this misis = the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor takes for each difference in the files where he starts and where he ends. this important information is lost when the outcome is stored as a text file and it's too much expense, extra a file format may discard that it could store.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was too big to have so far. you can always restore a definite version from choosing a source A / B / C. to convert a source A / B / C, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is sudden; No src linens; published and the text can't be extinguished. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; use many colors to highlight the differences. even more pronubleshooting would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleague and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To get all the functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or greater.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information, how you can use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE, you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or the ChangeLog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir provides the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems with compiling. should, however, please report difficulties, please report on & kde; -mailinglists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replacing the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to update the folder with the function update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to display the differences. this also causes that identical files will not be copied to the target folder. if the target file doesn't change these files, they are missing in a later program version.) This option is disabled in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2448">NOTE the buttons on the selection of the source with the labels, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are displayed at the end of the selected group (if the lines are already existing), if the lines are already existing, they are transferred to the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default, this option is disabled. Undershooting in single characters (e.g. 'A' and 'a') are classified as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minivorlook of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop, trying to finish it or move it. this works both inside a working area and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running on the desktop. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the central mouse button, windows can be moved within & ppager. movement is possible both inside a working area and other workareas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & kpager. if you click on an application within & kpager, the context menu will also be clicked on the application and the entries minimize, maximize, workspace and sending. the commands differ:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only when it was clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sending the application to select virtual desktop. only appears if it was clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this checkbox is marked, windows can be moved inside and from the central mouse button on the working area and also to other workareas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & kpager, the name of the virtual desktops display.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Check this field makes the & kpager. display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is shown in combination with name, name numbers are provided, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background is also displayed as background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & kpager. otherwise, only the empty chairs will be shown to make their choice.</seg>
<seg id="2461">This is the view of the program window. simply displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows a small view of the program window. NOTE: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager can be displayed: Classic drops & kpager, known as from Pager applications in some other Windows users; horizontal shows all virtual workareas in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical range, what is very good for representation on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to Pager's mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can display and move windows in size as symbols or with its content. besides, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager, and subsequent alteration of the switch... makes the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog, but you can do this manual:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you don't have to apply a user root or contact to your system administrator. in this file you need to specify the key windowtransparentMode and to refer to this value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & kpager is part of the packet base, you need a functioning installation of the KDE-Basic packets.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding by new functions. it is optimized for top performance accounts.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & klike; the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following this window is displayed as a magnified window. the image that appears in the magnified window is referred to as an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default settings you are enlarged and stimulates the area around the mouse pointer. alternatively, you can add a selected screen area in the enlarging window) or the surroundings of the mouse button on the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">Do you want to avoid the cursor in the enlarged window, please note down the mouse pointer. please note that the mouse is not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard-kde; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adapt the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the enlarging window and keep the left mouse button, so you can catch the content of the enlargement pstick and move on. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you need the & Shift key; push or use the & MMB; you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the drop window. NOTE that the upper left corner of the drop-down window will stand and only the lower right corner is moving.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same spot. it is thought to help people suffering a while on the same spot. it is also intended to help people suffering from your mouse. it also requires pulling with the mouse. this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can cause the pain when clicking on the mouse, helping to use so many people who have caused the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may need to find a doctor if you're not done using the use of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To show it again: even if & kmousetool; pain help helps with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by the desire of the mouse, and as with all the ergonomic features, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and run a mouse click once you get the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart shift is enabled, makes & kmousetool; a break, after it is executed by pushing the mouse button. in this way you can move the thrust at pressed mouth. the smart shift requires a little exercise but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mausoleum you have to cut out, before & kmousetool, click on a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the rotation is enabled in shifting mode (1 / 10 s), the time will be stopped, die & kmousetool; after the shutdown the mouse is waiting, before the mouse is stopped, when the mouse is done, no desire of the mouse is done.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, one click on the right and back, followed by a break, one click with the right mouse button. this movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but first time started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears to be delayed, you can select the response time to reduce the response time. go to sound and multimedia, select sound system and here the riders General. there is a slider, sound buffer, which you can set at a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other window frames, please select the relevant documentation to find out how you automatically launch a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings back on the values when opening the dialog box. have you already pressed the button to turn off, the settings will be reset to the last drummer of call.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially with the preferences. especially the intelligent process should be turned off first. if you then click on the automatic mouse, you can later be able to make smart shifts.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, if necessary, the response times of & kde may be decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click on any side without effect: the click on the neutral window, which does not display a link. you can park your mouse at such places, until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is trucking, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick is not only clean but also the rolls that get in touch with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must take out the mouse gel. as this happens, the mouse is different from mouse to mouse, but it should be quickly clear if you see the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd need to see the rolls. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt could easily be scratched with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks down the execution of & kmousetool; if you're using a shift in this case, it means that & kmousetool is not able to finish the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you are using & kmousetool; move under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click here. by adding the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run away click the cursor and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor place where you want to get there. but you can't want to use a mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you don't want to use a mouse click here. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray surfaces around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work smartly shifts, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The Intelligent Different is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it and again add him to the clipboard, if you want to add it to the clipboard, but it will probably never make problems. here are some advice there:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the Intelligent Different, if you just start to use & kmousetool; use text instead like this: take a click of the text area and hold the switch-down button, while you move the mouse pointer at the other end of the text and add the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this allows you to pick a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when to the smart rebs the shift starts. later, you can use the smart shift also without the listening mouse click. but for this you need some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to use, the XTest extension for & X window; should be installed on most system already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and speakers that have been set correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; stresses the mouse button soon as the mouse pointer. this program was designed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome and suffering pain of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins, before the mouse begins to get rid of the mouse. in this way the mouse can also be performed with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Detailed user documentation can be found with help: / kmousetool (include either these & URL; in the address bar of & konqueror; or run khelpcenter help: / kmousetool).</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts;. for normal work with & ktts; filter are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters Text, text is handled before being sent to the program speech dispatcher. they are useful to replace incorrect words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and narrator, or to avoid specific defects of language synthesia and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the workings of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; different types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is presented to all other orders and keeps these contracts. if the output of the screen Reader is pre-read, orders received will be continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is too hot reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these contracts will continue after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the upcoming priority. a message takes regular text. & kmouth; is an example for a application to read the news. during you & eg; a long text on a web page, you can enter the room. & kde; -alerts are also news. read it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text applications. any order you encounter from the ticket orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that have text applications. text motions intended for longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four commissions will be practised in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if a application is sent out, during & ktts; just a such book, this issue will be stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, news, text applications as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at the moment, there are three kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String quintet parts of a text by other text. the replacement parts can be supplied as words or as regular expressions. using predefined character set filters (as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & KMail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use a XSLT-file (XML; Style Language - transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in scope of scope of delivery; some XSLT-files are included in the contents of & XHTML; in SSML format.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speech disappointments, you can send orders depending on the content of the text, or depending on the program, sent to an article by sending a female voice, you can read text from KDE news about it. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has the rules when it is applied for a speech output. if the filter does not apply it, he will not pass the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; will be edited by all active filters, which are implemented on the page below. the processing of filters according to the list is carried out in the order in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This displays the list of normal normal filter files. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are subjected from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filters, and it will be shown below the following standard dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up character set filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparing pattern, then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text. large and lower case will be ignored when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify a name for your filter. this name can be chosen arbitrarily, it must only differ from the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the string in the column conform and replacing it in accordance with the string from the column proceeds. the list is displayed in the displayed order from above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to shift the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, entries are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is registered here, the filter is only applied when the speaker is based on the text order that is based on the button in order to display a list of languages. click on the button to list a list of languages. you can also select several languages at the mouse click button.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Here is a value set, the filter will be applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversational, KMail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You can use the program qas; the & DBus; -numbers you need to let go. if for example & qil; the application ID app-3432 can be displayed, you can only copy it.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string filter filter is applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared to words the string match uses regular expressions in the form\\\\ Word\\ see The words must be limited by dividers (space character) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this handbook you can find no instruction to write regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; regular & # 160; regular expressions, you can find it in the dialogs. the & # 160; Home & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Return the path xsltproc to the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is reachable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker selection filters, you can send texts to a specific spokesman, who is set up on the map narrator, or to create a speaker with certain properties. you can specify that texts from a female voice should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text on the filter gives it a speaker for the text. the speaker is displayed using the text, the program proposes the text on & ktts; schema, and the properties of on the card box narrator, you can overwrite the selected spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Here is a value set if the text is applied, if the text is applied, if the text is installed and # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; regular expressions, you can use it by clicking on the button to get help from entering the input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., begin the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Place the characteristics of the desired cup bearer. if the text is met with the above shown filter conditions, the speaker is selected, who want to see the desired requirements on the right click on the button to preview the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your Interphone settings, or to erase all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a speech output. this standard includes brands for controlling the voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the voice and sound-height. SSML is a part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partly and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the Rab _ diphet voice (British male) as it is the default voice, the festival is used by SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or sound position in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually very monoton spoken.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and propositives recognizable filter (SDB filters). thus, you can read & ktts; faster with the pre-read, not the whole text order. so you can proceed or stop on the card box, even if the voice synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositives filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up a propositional encoder filter. you can change its settings or add another propositives filters, but it will not be topped off.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way, you learn the choice of speech selection by trying. turn the spokesperson on the card holder, select the spokesperson on the card games, and select the choice of speaking voice. for example, you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then, faster with the pre-read can begin, since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long.</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can stop text orders directly on the card box, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal propositives filter is automatically set up if you run kttsmgr for the first time. it can not be removed, but don't change anything about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">The propositional sign filter compare the text with a regular expression (decimalcode 8) to the propositional sign (decimalcode 8) to the propositional sign (automatically removed from the script). NOTE that the default value of the default value of the character will be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -news (kg.), warnings, news or output of screen readers.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter;, which allows the management of the network interfaces, the routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings for a single, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network values in & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the network settings (knetworkconf;) can be programmed by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & kmenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.conf; Network hardware doesn't need to install. physical units and its drivers have already been installed and configured to configure, so & knetworkconf; the device ever shows and allows adjusting the power characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added to the Install of & Linux; later, network devices are added later, the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network module is loaded when the network settings are selected in & kcontrolcenter; -Index is attempted. when starting the module settings, this platform tries to detect the platform automatically on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not recognized, the terrestrial option is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release of the release. by setting the setting, non-load queries can permanently fall down. when setting up the network settings, this option will be preset automatically by default.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings is possible only in system administered mode. in advance, all options are displayed only, which means settings can only be considered. in the system administered mode you can only see by clicking the button in the right end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system command mode, the total functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces are equipped with the management of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the number of available network interfaces can be performed following the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Select network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button in the dialog box... setup in a dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings dialog shows the dialog with further outgoing options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings for the system is carried out. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system is performed at any system start and therefore, no further adjustment is required. in the list box, either DHCP or BOOTP, can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The selection manual can be performed without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the requested TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnetmask is required.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initialize the network interface for booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog appears as characteristics of the device in the list box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network will not be used. by entering a TCP / IP conflict, you can determine whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrators should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices may be enabled or switched off. switching to a host run is done by selecting from the list and click on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network appliances can be enabled or switched off. disable off a activated network later by selecting from the list and click of the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the machine in the local sub-network that facilitated the physical connection to remote networks and is used as default to the TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">When the computer is more than a network interface, the interface has to be selected, where the gateway computer is selected.</seg>

<seg id="2830">It can be performed by the following tasks: then by clicking on OK the list of the static lift is updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, you have to set out in one & console; the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the newest version of the source.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool with a graphic user can be used as a package or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">The installation of Qt and & kde will not be sufficient for this case, but additionally, the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf. you can afford the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology are discussed, in the second one of & knetworkconf; modified configuring files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area may not replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix contains only basic information about inclusion of the PC into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">At present, IP networks are run through TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never expected great spreading. this description is therefore concentrated in the near future. therefore, this description is currently being concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is allocated in a network of network, on & eg; workplace is the telephone number allocated, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily chosen!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When using an own small (home) network, the IP address is intended to prevent IP address data using the global network (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore their favourite use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be used for such machinery by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0, so all calculators are participating in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route that takes the loopback address (localhost = its own computer). the standard route is required for IP redirects.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is one of its own loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, you are the configuration files that are processed by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file sometimes needs to be dynamic with DSL links so that it is not surprising if in the case of active DSL links that can be found elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Suzconfig. some other stand can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a security program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it also offers the ability to create multiple archives on a band. the first goal was to create a question that my wife asked him: how much longer does it take?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be downloaded from & kdat; it can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trained the band back and reads the pretenure information of the tape. recognise & kdat; the band doesn't know if the band is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognise & kdat; the foreword, searches for the right index on your record. cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive, signifying that the band was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before leaving the band, first connection must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a change of the symbol for the band so that the integration of the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band is now ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it doesn't need to format a band before use. floppy drive is usually not to be formatted; DAT drives doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape are lost, the volume is automatically bound and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you reach the backup job, you must select the backup files. that can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Choose a file or folder in the local file area. it is only protected by this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Marking a security profile in a tree. only the files are secured in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file space with a checkmark. only the selected files and / or subfolder are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button on the local file space, click on a menu View menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is initiated, the dialog settings for backup. in this dialog, you can test the selected files, and change the settings for securing the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in record for the drive. it is only verified the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a checkmark. only the selected files and / or subfolder are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">As soon as the test procedure was launched, the dialog settings for checking. in this dialog you can check your selection and check the workplaces for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">When you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as data throughput and remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can run the restore, the files you need to be restored will be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives files which belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a checkmark. only the files are restored and / or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button, click a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the reinstreation process has started, the dialog settings for restoring. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the workplaces for restoring.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you have confirmed the settings for restoring, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput and remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexfile using the band content. this proceeds all existing indexes for this band. you can recreate the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a secure profile with the right files and the default settings. you can select the following settings for use:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder where the backup should be done. the list of files to be secured will automatically be updated according to the right chosen folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only the files are supported on the same file system, just like the folder. folder that can be found on other filesystem, each entry is considered independently from the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">With a incremental backup. to determine which files changed since the last incremental backup, a snap file is used. only the files will have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The file name, which is used to specify the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the Snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be secured and a new snap file for the next fuse will be created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons are gt; & lt; files was not yet implemented at the time of creating this documentary.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the KDat menu item... in the menu, select the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path has to refer to the non-winding model of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, conveyed & kdat; before the tape, the command is mounted to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operation can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try to lock the trigger from tape drives. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, loosing the binding file; automatically eject the band, use this option not with floppy shamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case, you must inform block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the band. this file should only cover a memory block on the band. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N Byte) The volume ID. the format of this sequence is calculating name: seconds, where computer name is the full name of the system, where the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds which has been formatted since the band.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar pitch, which can run directly with & GNU; -tar, even other tar versions should work, as long as it does not include incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup belt. this symbol is only active when a band is bound.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for unexperienced users, where you can obtain information about your system, or where the system allows fast access to access information about problems linked on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your calculator makes in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who cannot know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored in the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access to information on problems linked on their server; therefore, try to provide some extended functions, where the help can be filtered and evaluated with the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1. & ksystemsis; a number of useful functions. among others it includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server format and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in the following chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following image files, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with whose aid, the individual protocol lines can be easily filtering and sort the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After start up & ksystemsis, first the most important transcript file of the system - you will not display them, and it opens, instead of a small news window, so you don't have a system administrator. the protocol files can normally be found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user normally does not have any justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion, in order to filter by a selected criterion. the list of the log-lines will be displayed automatically. in the default setting, the select line is displayed only, if in one of the columns the string of the filter keyword is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry on this site. select the string to select a different record. then, for example, select the column log file, and apply it in the filter bar the name of a process, so you will find & ksystemlog; all protocol lines which were sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to identify the most important protocol lines. protocol-lines of the level errors are shown with a remarkable color as protocol lines. the colored display of protocol-lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in Cron protocol), so you may want to process the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command as for example to start the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can turn the option to new lines in the context menu from the main window to display all the new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog: allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open and manage this feature in the menu window to open additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindows, select the protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has an own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software compatible .org. you will find more current information about the Sources of & ksystemsis.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and described in the following also so named) as & ksysv;. this section leads a few concepts and describing what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init quickly grows to the standard for monitoring the system starts while driving on the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (among other things, because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init Binary file lies under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could attempt to install a machine on System V Init, without a reinstall and reformatting file. so you must make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD inct that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are rather than in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start at the high level of system or when switching to another runlevel. system services include such things like setserial, which is only started at once. such calls are not supported by rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be sworn under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also aim a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places according to the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inaccess. you should see in the initial area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can design a look into the second column, and probably determine that the default is runlevel 3. if you wish to change it, then you can reload / etc / inaccess from hand. if you have updated it, then you can restart the system restart and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder no right files are. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init virtually system services? quite simple: every one of the scripts is so written that it is a argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if one K contains, the script will stop using the argument stop. if he contains an S, the script will be called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel, which can be running only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; walk. furthermore, I could have a user runlevel, das & etc; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say, not trivial: pull an entry out of the field of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start this level (or stopping).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts themselves between Runleveln or change the position inside a level by moving it anywhere else. this occurs only if it does not take out an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">NOTE: entries will be postponed if you need to copy this into a new round, you need to select a copy from the menu or select from the context menu, and then, if this entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorrow number of a single entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case you have to process the sorting numbers of the sorted entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">NOTE: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the Recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a choice of tor- or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another round, move it into the clipboard (you can use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To modify the sorting number or the name of a single entry button, press the input button to change the dialog button, to accept the dialog button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the loss of the data loss, all entries for the menu requiring a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc file. preset will be downloaded from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise, they are stored in a local ksysvrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experiments with the Standard Runleveln, and now the machine will launch new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Type LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; available at runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributors. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, how to start system services in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for proprietary entries of these distributions, but does not contain any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan a extension of the program for that approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distro: please check if all the configuration files are required (and also if you are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end up, if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution distribution, it can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it's sufficient to read the chapter customization of & user; read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you've made changes, you have to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry file menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two maps, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialog in User and group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some maps are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have selected key settings (Quota) if you have to set individual settings, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd will be installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The ticket card password file appears, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map of card will only be activated and initialized for at least one built-in file system (quota) and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change the limit values each in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups informs about the group addresses of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user is owned, will be found in the Primary Primary Group. furthermore, users can highlight the user in other groups by setting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, check this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select from the menu user or group or click on the matching add button on the tool bar. to work or delete the selected user or the selected group works as analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can add the LILO BootManager, remove and modify the boot time, remove and modify the time up to the booting of the standard operating system, remove, delete operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
