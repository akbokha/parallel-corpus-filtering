although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extremely big .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American music d@@ anced to American music and run American writ@@ ers .
in fact , this land had a pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly directed to some American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year old , I played the brilliant D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , an aw@@ ful re@@ porter , with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ student , who covered the Supreme Court of oil with judges whose interest was inc@@ lined .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; it was &quot; like that the absolute truth is , forget everything I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my mir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming that you are always who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even wrote a very heart@@ felt love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the en@@ comp@@ ence and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as it goes with his narrow @-@ die .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so pretty .
he says exactly what he thin@@ ks like a former collective , and publicly declared its contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
however , people have re@@ acted to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves to him .
the 13 million votes , which he won at the publi@@ can pre@@ sidential elections , was the highest number formed by the Party of nom@@ in@@ ized candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person ?
I could not ste@@ al Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers who did not agree with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
like for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist , who occup@@ ies people from all over the world , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tr@@ ump wor@@ m@@ ates wor@@ m@@ umps with the author of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ag@@ a and I met with our common Love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix &quot; to look at the game .
Tr@@ ump In@@ toler@@ ant is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I fought with the environment , and with her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she also adap@@ ts to the presence of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ as , who still helped with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get to the complex@@ ity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , her wise advice had helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those caused by them em@@ bo@@ died , for@@ s@@ aken my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump finds its way to the appointed re@@ publi@@ can pre@@ sidential election , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of its restricted vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans gave him the Pre@@ sidency of a man , despite being - or maybe even because of his contemp@@ t toward not @-@ white people .
the conflict with the idea that people agreed for Tr@@ ump because they were either shared by rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were willing to over@@ see these things .
maybe it is un@@ fair the Tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ ers to draw as la@@ very .
the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is a su@@ perf@@ icial and respec@@ t@@ ful and indicates un@@ ability to understand those who act and act in a different way .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fe@@ ars will not be considered over the hec@@ tic changes in their con@@ greg@@ ations .
could it be that this vot@@ ers , of whom most white are tuned for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to re@@ ate control over a country that they dis@@ appointed ?
in other words , they would perhaps say they are still important in America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ ented the cru@@ el decision to raise a man , who looks by contemp@@ t on those who looks differ@@ ently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ e@@ ash &quot; ( by default ) : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of White For all other Eth@@ n@@ ias &quot; ; word match of white in playing on the White and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Schle@@ uder@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones mentioned that which America has done so great .
millions people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what belief or background you can still have , America is just welcome .
for this country chose his President twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ ser , whose story as he himself says , no@@ where else in the world would be possible .
with choosing Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says that hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is res@@ umed , they say .
I have to think about Kh@@ iz@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd rep@@ lied with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; bre@@ wed the crowd .
&quot; have you got a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they responded .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a space in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were loud .
&quot; would som@@ eb@@ ody , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he got an un@@ anim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO . &quot;
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; thank God , thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was translated .
the country , for whom his son , was sent to him a message .
that is now Tr@@ ump Land , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what &apos;s the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the waste
Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby Roman@@ tic ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) in the municipality consists of children and adults existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a possibility to overcome them with their musical instruments .
a school with 100 students is the central interest for the community of Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote on this project :
the community that is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os is known for its drug abuse and gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth had so much more rarely ho@@ pel@@ essly .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , asking local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run by du@@ sty streets to pursu@@ e their big passion .
they always come alive and play with shiny eyes and play in the chest you meet the day for trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , French horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga .
music from Mül@@ l@@ tr@@ ash
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vicente Guer@@ r@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village which is practically on top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unc@@ ion in Paraguay , is based on flat instruments , which are produced from recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments , which consist of local firm waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ au@@ ra , where the Recy@@ c@@ ler started to shift parts of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , all parts of the instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate Ge@@ igen , Viola , C@@ elli , Double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , trombones and percussion , which were all manufactured of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the re@@ per@@ toire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music and music of Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an Los Angeles Times article , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ o@@ ge and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning of the time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place . children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them did not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays out on musical instrument and calls the The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary name &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic land@@ fills ) shows the musical effort to :
each year , the world generates approximately one billion met@@ ric tons of waste .
those who live with him and are living with him - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .

the orchestra made his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight the illegal fishing industry

in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already used illegal fishing for illegal fishing , before it was searching the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were raised up and slightly inc@@ lined , a legisl@@ ative of this species to welcome their co@@ asts .
in Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ized themselves against the ship . they refused to meet one of their har@@ bo@@ urs and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing association , is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish .
eventually , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fisher@@ men .
the core of this initiative , who cros@@ ses the criminal practices and protects resources , FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 of the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally stop F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries held the Premier of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the PE@@ W Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally . this project provides FISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is hidden is hidden that because it is extremely difficult to susp@@ end . this is illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by deli@@ ber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ it@@ ats and species are expected to harm the illegal fishing ec@@ os@@ ystems which a del@@ ic@@ ates equ@@ il@@ ibri@@ um .
but during action against illegal fishing companies were hin@@ dered by bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ iri@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real @-@ time , with per@@ secu@@ tions on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , like to susp@@ ect any news on susp@@ ect activities or details which can be noticed during a har@@ bor view .
fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive , when moving from the open lake , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify the ships which are in prohibited regions of fish - about such a susp@@ ected road bug@@ ging - about such that suggest@@ s that a ship invites their caught fish to other ships .
ideally such studies indicate whether the ships have a fishing licence , where they were traveling and possibly also if they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing industry , can be denied by the ass@@ um@@ ption of such ships in their har@@ bo@@ urs . what means that they can not sell their cargo as their cargo as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to accompl@@ ish , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Berg@@ h , director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company based on illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win more than 20 million USD in lost revenues , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fisher@@ men who enters in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industry , which attrac@@ ts the world &apos;s commercial fishing in all over the world , including these illegal fishing fisher@@ men .
among other practices , including actions are including sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license documents , giving of imag@@ ination , f@@ ish@@ ings of protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ally lo@@ op@@ hole was trying to close FISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed Front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investig@@ ations of susp@@ ects .
it has criminal networks that had spread f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and has been pursu@@ ed and found refuge .
due to its inter@@ pol@@ ation with Inter@@ pol , the international agency for com@@ b@@ ating crimes , FISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that the FISH @-@ i should help to sto@@ w a precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always enhanced , does not help to stop the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; the f@@ illi@@ c@@ love fisher@@ men use trem@@ end@@ ously refined techniques to conce@@ ive its activities and their position , &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Che@@ f@@ Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , einer N@@ RO , which concerns itself with fishing and fish @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships start for example their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be supported by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to establish a system which connects different information levels . it should help FISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with larger precision .
a program
however , FISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations on the und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently Sky@@ Truth has opened with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana , the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite news and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each ch@@ ases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; PE@@ W Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project , where a global system allows the prosec@@ ution of ships .
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only min@@ cri@@ min@@ als but it will also cri@@ be .
ships that previously f@@ ish@@ ly without licence must not be expected with consequences , know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries joined FISH @-@ i in the meantime a 33 % increase of fisher@@ ies sales , since fishing boats have bought more licenses .
once FISH @-@ i Somalia had put up at Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors there were on board drag @-@ networks whose use is prohibited .

other countries also realize this achie@@ vements . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , there are several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing .
there will be six different countries together in 2015 , for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting the illegal fishing industry , after exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with security , the goal is to develop even more such initi@@ atives and structures in other regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member Somalia were behind his first great tri@@ umph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag . and not only the boat was on the way and were used by drag chains , which are already prohibited .
the ship was also entered in prohibited waters that are reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; by taking the dimensional rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i is another success of many . and at the same time , Emma Bry@@ ce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . where , Emma Bry@@ ce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes to the theme of the environment , technology and nutrition .

on Twitter , images that talk about disp@@ utes , as well as reports of de@@ pression and abuse .
especially large waves sm@@ ote the message through pol@@ len op@@ pression located centrally located in the central city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the government to the police and the armed conflict of the government .
hours later , they could rely for@@ s@@ aken the cathedral , but the prot@@ ests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including those women in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira .
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira carry out no skirts because you could not see something many national gar@@ den@@ ers don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that forms the extent of op@@ pression per day :
then the dict@@ ator@@ ship set the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for an am@@ t@@ sen@@ ic process - these was now proven by the presence of many hundreds of people on the road .
my@@ te@@ ks Media Labs includes :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are f@@ aked .
here is your am@@ t@@ ship !
on the road !
other limits these prot@@ ests as a further step in the fight against a government which made a little bit against the dev@@ ast@@ ating economic crisis and appro@@ ached to leave critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mart@@ yr@@ s always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ans reported the media they were becoming hungry in order to participate in a strike , rather than to work or to shop .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , a reference on 23 August 2016 , to D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine message .
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret pris@@ oner in the Argentin@@ ian city Córdoba .
meanwhile , in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera cre@@ ator , Qu@@ ij@@ ano said in the province of Córdoba , op@@ posed to his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dict@@ ator@@ ship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
it all started with the burden , the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in prison la Per@@ la , who observed in the age of 15 , has suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret .
at the same time I believed that which was in order .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one is not noticed by his father .
I didn &apos;t recogn@@ ise that my father was a th@@ ief , the Fol@@ ter@@ er and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dict@@ ator@@ ship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was Deputy Commander 141 in the prison la Per@@ la .

Archives of Archives .
this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , an op@@ pressed because of kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child charged .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ an@@ os son , a man who knew the extent of atro@@ cities which he had chosen as a boy , and who spoke against a federal court against his own father .
his story shows that great power a parent has his child and how this child has chosen a way of salvation .
from the gym to the military base
when my father began to participate in a military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I was che@@ ering with a boy , the fighting sport .
all of them quot@@ ed him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white picture and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that they will not lead you one day and I must save you .
the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ uc@@ ion@@ ario del Pu@@ eblo , - Revolu@@ tionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolution@@ aries of Argentina .
therefore he forb@@ id to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because my father had moved me .
on the military base I had to destroy documents who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : universities , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ paganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ Here the prisoners are tort@@ ured &quot;
my father took me four times from La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks in cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ d@@ ges - simply everything possible .
everything was st@@ olen .
he gave me a tiny pack@@ et and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump in silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the st@@ olen objects have been shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open room and said :
the prisoners are tort@@ ured here .
I saw in and saw a Lie@@ ge that tort@@ ured on man .
she looked like a cub@@ a bed and metal springs .
later on , I found that it was fast@@ ened to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was bound up there .
you rarely spoke a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured him with water and pursu@@ ed a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ is@@ i@@ ón Provinc@@ ial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there was in@@ dispens@@ able ... like a dirty win@@ em@@ one .
years later , when my father kept under house arrest , the same od@@ our came out of his room .
I realized the od@@ our again and I became clear that the smell of a body is in dist@@ ress .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ i knew compl@@ ain that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where cap@@ tives were cap@@ tiv@@ ated and mour@@ ned .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civ@@ ilian which was also accused of trial ) and I used the opportunity to cast a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were laid down with the face - all were bound by hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people qui@@ et@@ ly standing on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you do , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I met him . why did you bring me nothing ? &quot;
I knew compl@@ ain that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her at home .
beside La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were mentioned as a offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero sm@@ ote there a man and killed there .
( according to survi@@ vor@@ s , the Civil is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , which was also sentenced to death in Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former chambers .
the road , which you came in , is also the way , on which the kid@@ n@@ apping came here .
when you look to the map , you will see that they took about this path and then tort@@ ured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they received a number assigned to the trial of the issue .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came , that they should be re@@ located .
this was fal@@ se@@ hood - E@@ uph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ lo@@ ot &apos;
my dad brought all the st@@ olen things by home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war sp@@ ute &quot; - as they called it .
but when I was at the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was convinced that war@@ n was a bay@@ onet , or perhaps military badges , the man has fought an enemy .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... asc@@ ended , then that is not a war@@ n of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is the@@ ft .
I always asked me how my father , the leader of security forces , in which v@@ and@@ alism was able to bring me .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything ther@@ ein .
I don &apos;t get that my father was doing .
once he called me a crime and I said , &quot; Will you that you run cars on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded afraid of rage , he sm@@ ote me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and surrounding you .
we do not need any other one !
this was my father .
I don &apos;t have a good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of wool felt on which I had a jacket and a trol@@ ley pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
then , the defense accused me to have been ab@@ dic@@ ted with this crime . I re@@ lied , no problem , they can witness to me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to speak out .
&apos; the f@@ anc@@ ement of the body is the last ab@@ evil A@@ kt &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel Re@@ ue .
I have children . if you only have children , one recognize the value of a lifetime .
one develops and recogn@@ ise that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so good , so you ex@@ u@@ cked out during the dict@@ ator@@ ship . but why the corp@@ ses will disappear ?
why are children kid@@ n@@ apped ?
one day , my father brought a girl to his mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked me the question : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them into prison .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why they disappear ?
did those people not have families who could give their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ able act that man can do man in a man .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they grab@@ bed machines to elim@@ inate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were crus@@ hed and no@@ where - no idea , where . &quot; you never will find something , &quot; my father said .
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i saw how you killed people ! &apos;
just to decl@@ are it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have the truth about 20 cri@@ min@@ als - including my father .
the thought , signif@@ ying my father , was created during a meeting , when he was under house arrest .
I made him st@@ up@@ tions because of all the atro@@ cities which I needed to live .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t know anyone behind . &quot;
I felt comp@@ lied with comp@@ assion and asked me what about the entire out@@ break Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they were allegedly def@@ ended , really good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me about this ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed aw@@ ful crime , and you were forced to sign me as a child .
he only re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant &quot; I still show me on . &quot;
exactly this I did .
in 2010 , I re@@ tain the first ad .
I finally knew that he was a criminal .
no one can with@@ draw me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally spoke against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest until the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 criminal charges : among them severe , un@@ law@@ ful liber@@ ty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death successes in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of child .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to Spanish to the size of the pri@@ mal form .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial concluded between March 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 The de@@ pression of crimes against humanity was found guilty of crimes against humanity , and in nine cases prison sent@@ ences aged between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were ad@@ ver@@ ts .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .

all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police , and civil staff .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kid@@ n@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he built the following words to the floating chamber :

the court case is a historical milestone for all human rights organisation , that have worked for years to justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , an Argentine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who had been murdered or disappeared during the dict@@ ator@@ ship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government introduced the country to La Per@@ la , where there was a memorial to be initiated by human rights organization .

a translation def@@ ect makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; ter@@ rif@@ ic drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend its guide .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
within the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers were able to rene@@ w a newly opened centre where you can pro@@ long his driver &apos;s leading record in the last month .
in a shield , the Japanese word &quot; gir@@ der , &quot; ( ko@@ whe@@ und@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means - perhaps , maybe even with bad back@@ ge@@ ons &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ ay@@ able motor@@ ists . &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays at the entrance hall and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which is subject to social media .
the mistake was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ oto , and it was also atten@@ tive to the local newspaper .
the Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n &apos;s daily newspaper wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such a English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an ins@@ ult to el@@ derly people and in an international town like Kyoto &apos;s simply acceptable . &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the def@@ ective English translation was removed first . &quot; drivers &quot; ( deutsch : &quot; aw@@ ay@@ able motor@@ ists &quot; ) was later replaced by the fair , if the program is not entirely correct , &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police pre@@ f@@ ecture was promised for the translation stage . however , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been reviewed by transl@@ ator , and that the translation has not been reviewed in their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a g@@ ger reported as follows about the exc@@ use :
&quot; it is really sorry that older people felt by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) addressed to us , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat slightly more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fe@@ as@@ ible &quot; was mat@@ ched as an appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police there are the proportion of older drivers involved in acc@@ idents , but absolutely cause for worry .
for example , in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of the total of 19.@@ 460 deaths of sen@@ iors were created . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1.@@ 803 created from 11.@@ 850 dis@@ cases .
in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
whereas the number of in@@ jur@@ ies resulted in overall , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused acc@@ idents in the same period has increased .
the well @-@ called re@@ porter revealed in the published version of the article entitled comments to the light that show the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese fig@@ hts against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So fool@@ ish@@ ly is the translation or not ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there is no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widely distributed in Japan and the whole of Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure for these b@@ iz@@ arre mist@@ akes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lat@@ ors are manifold .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and transl@@ ate active knowledge of knowledge in the target language .
the latter requires the active dom@@ ination of the target language - something that is in case of native language . generally , the belief in the target language - not in the original language - native voice should be .
thus , a French native language should be translated from English to French - not from the French into English .
photo of Flick@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies emplo@@ y no staff with English as a native language that might transl@@ ate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding , cost @-@ green , or relatively small number of English native speakers that are Japanese .
some companies that even have no foreign employees , they will produce each company , but the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is being hon@@ ored to transl@@ ator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Flick@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ative and r@@ all@@ ful phr@@ ases that are created by machine translations , show that technology can not replace nor yet a human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this is especially true for several languages .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also the en@@ ig@@ matic re@@ prints , often using T @-@ shirts or hand@@ bags , are used only for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by big companies or from the government to ensure greater standards , more careful translations can be expected .
the town of Kyoto takes up a ser@@ i@@ ant source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : prot@@ ests and security measures on the Internet and Television
main site of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Fre@@ ies Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7th , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users that they had no access to the online transmitter Viv@@ o@@ play .
later , other users wrote that the Internet access from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV will no longer be available .
other online channels also over@@ carried pictures of the prot@@ ests in Carac@@ as , organized by op@@ position@@ able groups that res@@ ist the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
prot@@ ests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ band@@ ed the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks on the executive branch and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the bond was short@@ ened , and received the U@@ sage , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that web pages ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an providers are closed again .
this is from the side of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ o play are popular with the Ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ern with internet access , especially in times of distur@@ b@@ ances .
traditional media have been re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant to prot@@ ests on prot@@ ests since 2014 . in that time , the Commission asks for t@@ elec@@ ommun@@ ications when they continued to report about the demonstr@@ ations , as the Commission didn &apos;t see this as &quot; call to violence . &quot;
I have registered on @ vi@@ vo@@ play@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
amazing that it &apos;s still cheaper than to buy two litres of so@@ das .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ o@@ play is not accessible by a locking by the domain name System ( DNS ) but also two other online transm@@ itters . this also applies the website where the National Assembly transfers their meetings .
earlier investig@@ ations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that the local Internet Explorer benef@@ ited on a technology . this is a technique provided by the DNS @-@ servers of certain domains .
when a website is blocked by the DNS system , the server is incor@@ rec@@ t or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ ab@@ oli@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ vo@@ play@@ net
with V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flores , which was put into custody for the prot@@ ests in Carac@@ as .
Flores is defeated , while he was in custody for police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV was on the show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government is reported that the government is regulated by access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls become slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ min@@ ita as a child . now she visits the house where they worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , just as they became victims of abuse and dis@@ cri@@ mination .

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report from Cur@@ ie &apos;s biography , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying D@@ id , dec@@ lining schools &quot; ) , which is processed and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household , where she was not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house heard of pride about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
they turned out of something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita as Cri@@ ad@@ ita , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a large family with little money transfer their min@@ ors son or her husband &apos;s daughter to another , rich@@ est family . in exchange , the child will receive food , training and a roof over the head .
but whatever is not mentioned , the children may have to pay for count@@ less days of ho@@ use@@ work , who cannot be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that can &apos;t stop within the framework of a contract .
this practice is widely used as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( Paraguay ) due to the participation and acceptance of large sections of society and despite numerous complaints founded by human rights organizations .
after compl@@ eting his studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a collabor@@ ated for a few years for an organization aimed at boys and girls rights .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , cher@@ ished and p@@ ran@@ ger@@ te .
she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude is imp@@ lic@@ ted , guaranteed to n@@ urs@@ ing the Cri@@ ad@@ itas .
the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
it is the family that her daughter is in belie@@ ving that she conclu@@ de her training , improve their position in society , and &quot; can make something from itself , &quot; can be sent to another family .
the other hand stands the family that takes up the girl in itself , and whose explo@@ itation by faith is just@@ if@@ i@@ able that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise no training would be hungry and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ ass@@ ed , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they never know them .
so far , in January 2016 , this has been relatively unknown phen@@ om@@ ena , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came into the hospital , her body showed evidence of real pun@@ ches . shortly after that she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military couple Tom@@ ás Ferreira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ de@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the residence .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unc@@ ion .
in late January 2016 , Ferreira is defeated as long as a stick to Mar@@ ín , until it was le@@ thal .
this should be the last pun@@ ishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the inc@@ ident .
she emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNI@@ CEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply ro@@ oted in the grounds of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a &quot; modern form of s@@ la@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came together with protest letters and demanded that there were no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more co@@ ws are registered as children , &quot; compl@@ ained by Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without Pap@@ ers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the Ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors of ad@@ ul@@ tery and almost 60 civ@@ ilian organizations demanded an immediate investigation of the Falls .
they want Tom@@ ás Ferreira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to judgment .
the Life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as a workforce , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the colour@@ ing where their father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
her brothers had to go all work and began to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the As@@ unc@@ ion &apos;s capital in Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
in their employer &apos;s house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a collabor@@ ated between four and six hours each day .
they had to know the time so that you still remained a time for learning .
it arrived at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their emplo@@ yers .
Fri@@ days for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and the infected bas@@ ins .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more they had finished with the learning , the more leisure time it had .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their emplo@@ yers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to never hunger , but won &apos;t get even unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the owner than dinner from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the bud@@ get@@ ary , a former military and sympath@@ izers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was during the dict@@ ator@@ ship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some even@@ ings the bud@@ get@@ ary Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a in addition to him and Editorial from Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ ers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eblo &quot; can be found .
he tried to con@@ vince her to give the reports of the official media over the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held her for intelligent , but did not talk with her . &quot; the owner had someone who heard it , while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; you don &apos;t have allowed me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I had to learn there bad an@@ xi@@ ety one that belongs to the indi@@ gen@@ ous group of the Guaran@@ i at home again .
their Lord fe@@ ared that they had the formation which you had made , would lose it again , explains them .
it was completely clear that she got for everything they got from them , with their hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; a thing that almost never spoke , mo@@ b@@ bing and the Sch@@ ik@@ anen are exposed , they are exposed to the school when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite anyone to home at home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly notice@@ able that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
the Society divi@@ des Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can as@@ sign a job for cleaning workers and children &apos;s staff in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is P@@ EPA Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a subur@@ b of As@@ unc@@ ion , in the As@@ unc@@ ion region .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , playing in the morning and in the afternoon with you .
to learn .
please be back to you .
beginning from Monday , if possible .
the display got five &quot; sp@@ ikes &quot; and many comments .
a woman in Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had given a girl @-@ born girl and gave their phone number .
another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the country inner that wants to work . &quot;
then the author then turned up again :
love Friend@@ ly , I found one . I look like it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the shop was completed .
in the pro@@ log@@ ue to the Cri@@ ad@@ itas report , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of witness testim@@ onies given by former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to conclu@@ de systems like s@@ la@@ very , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a prac@@ tise of responsibility ) , with whom the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ado@@ res ( with whom the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ado@@ res ) , and the Min@@ qu@@ ist@@ ado@@ res ( with whom the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ado@@ res ) had to be regarded as they were still willing to provide a system of s@@ la@@ very , with which they become light victims for abuse and explo@@ itation .
the social in@@ equality in Paraguay and this for a look of power are the key to understanding the phen@@ om@@ ena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill signs Egyptian medi@@ ans social media pre @-@ register at the government

six@@ ty Egyptian par@@ li@@ aments have recently ordered a bill to investig@@ ate the regul@@ ators in terms of use and terms of use of social networks .
when Parliament is adopted by Parliament , users and users have to register social media in Egypt on a government administration to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , so that it is assigned to share social media .
within six months of acceptance of the law , users and users would have to register with their correct name and identity numbers to use social networks .
if there is failed to do this , so it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ids and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent is cur@@ ated , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de Application , which is running and used to commun@@ icate with others by voice , video tapes and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament in Parliament and parliament , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user name and password received a user@@ name and password &quot; from the fire@@ wall , the Facebook is blocked . &quot;
this may mean that Egypt is planning to ri@@ p a fire@@ wall at a national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary to submit more information to the Egyptians , to retri@@ eve the network to access the network .
but it &apos;s not known yet that such plans are there .
experts and experts in front of the site are ske@@ p@@ tical about the technical fe@@ as@@ ibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technology ( based on German &quot; Executive Research &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , the German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices told :
I dou@@ b@@ t@@ ful of technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion they make it so that as they are viol@@ ently physical and private rooms , it could also be done online .
when I take them seriously , this means that they may apply a strong surveillance system to ful@@ fill a citizen or not . and this means a crazy system to super@@ v@@ ise people &apos;s activities and also to adop@@ t them a court process .
this is techn@@ ically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted by law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ative legisl@@ ative Assembly and the Constitutional Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he &quot; says , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .

how a Kur@@ dish sch@@ olar protects the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards in Iraq war
one of the rare Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards .

this post by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental solutions . this post is published as part of an agreement on content sharing .
high above in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the nor@@ the@@ astern Iraq region , H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza , and her team of scientists of the Nich@@ es@@ g@@ ation Organization Nature tried to protect the g@@ host@@ ly Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which belong to the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) , they are among the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are based on account of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their hab@@ itat and as they are still less pre@@ y .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; Per@@ sian Leopard is the only remaining volume in the Kur@@ dish ec@@ os@@ ystem &quot; and the health and th@@ rive of the ec@@ os@@ ystem also depends on that a large volume of space is present .
the chance to see a Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards in the free game of wild@@ life is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video thus ens@@ uring that they have a recording of a large cat on the camera , R@@ aza doesn &apos;t break in pure joy .
as trained Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza f@@ ond one other side of their country , which is not just war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals for six years and also involved in educational programs from Nature Iraq .
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Special@@ ist Group since 2013 and it is a part of that protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .
Sebastian Meyer , a award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , produced this video for En@@ sia .
his work was published in numerous international publications , including the TIME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times .

in early March 2017 , the progress made in the Nor@@ theast Japan daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , which achieved progress in the last six years , was to be rebuilt by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a Atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had trig@@ gered the disaster .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a kind of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami had to come .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had left all the coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture had a nuclear accident , even alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from a local point of view which have been achieved for six years to re@@ build the life of local government .
the comprehensive report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ build authority as well as survey results for those concerned .
the residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of its planned equivalent houses ( ? ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ v@@ ate were completed .
the largest success under the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could mark Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima c@@ rank it with 70 percent .
but even six years after the cat@@ astrophe , he ev@@ acu@@ ated each other as six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ qu@@ ails ( Sh@@ ap@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , in the final replacement homes .
after the triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in behavi@@ ors .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such claims .
almost 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lack@@ ed in emergency notes , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in emerg@@ encies . more than 75 % of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres , which were registered after the disaster , were moved to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is 34 percent here .
the state of work and daily life in the three affected ec@@ tures
like K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the mis@@ fort@@ une , have opened their doors up until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while almost 100 % of fish fishing companies in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back in operation , only 30 percent of fishing permits have res@@ umed their operation .
ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident we have moved into quarters in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural areas in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only a consequence of the nuclear accident is , because only 690 hectares of land destroyed land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lying in the nuclear pl@@ ywood . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism improved again , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still stays far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent higher at the same level as before the mis@@ fort@@ une . Fu@@ kus@@ hima stood here for only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that since the cat@@ astrophe , almost half of the territ@@ ories , it was more difficult to earn their hab@@ itat .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a complete image , the newspaper conducted numerous survey@@ s among the native population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she question@@ ed about the status of rep@@ urch@@ asing and as well as their sens@@ ation towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung declar@@ es :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents carried out measures to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 55.@@ 9 percent of those survey@@ ed that still have not done enough in matters of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es health prevention .
as it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture ,
in its issue on the occasion of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung increased their attention also to the location of the ev@@ ac@@ ute from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to live only the trem@@ end@@ ous earthquake and dev@@ ast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also the witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic accident , atomic in@@ jur@@ ies to the Japan each time .
at a total of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were re@@ located in areas outside of the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , where they have been res@@ ett@@ led .
after the stand of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live out of their home @-@ pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are still more than 50 years old . they are in proper asser@@ tions that they have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . these are projects for construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak any other language , seem to be larger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , one however often recognize that a more gli@@ mp@@ se when it seems at first sight .
these global links are important because they extend our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our per@@ spectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small .
in this ep@@ isode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , let &apos;s look at exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we handle topics that often earn less attention when they deser@@ ve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment that they have felt very heavily with someone about language and country borders .

right : Mat@@ eus Ferreira da Silva in a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 came to the intensive weekend : last Friday , a police officer was defeated at a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators involved in a protest r@@ amp@@ h@@ way against as@@ par@@ agus .
Mat@@ eus Ferreira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on Saturday and have moved him into an artificial com@@ a .
its condition is considered critical .
the local sculpt@@ ress Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread within a few days fast in Brazil .
the face of the police station is to recognize the face of police officers , which was identified as Augusto S@@ amp@@ a@@ io .
after the inc@@ ident , the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás know that S@@ amp@@ a@@ io had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the occurr@@ ence of the active service .
the images show the police officers , such as it be@@ ats in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Ferreira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer could be beaten by a police station and landing on the inten@@ tional station , his face would be for six months and the entire op@@ pression would just@@ ify it .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ur@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press release of media activ@@ ists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , was attacked by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police and several renov@@ ations .
another video shows the same scenes , but emerged from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks .
in the shown clip , you can see the Attack on Mat@@ eus off the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , living in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2.@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to his family in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is at the hospital .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further viol@@ ations of activ@@ ists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás sees a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish from his father was murdered , just as he attacked the Occup@@ y in a Wh@@ ats@@ App Center , having attacked the very sorry case of Mat@@ eus Ferreira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police force , who has hit him with a stroke .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to demonstr@@ ate police reports on Friday last Friday .
polic@@ emen set prot@@ ests in the centre of Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro , where demonstr@@ ators had established a stage for speakers , rubber she@@ ds and lac@@ ri@@ as .
the member , Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( P@@ SOL ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce power against prot@@ esters .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ests were destroyed by foc@@ using on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disk .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported on a bro@@ och glass window to design their title page in illustr@@ ative .
however , the O Glo@@ bo fav@@ oured the title @-@ story with a fire @-@ placed bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ al@@ istic grounds , more about a broken down window than the prot@@ ests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this one must also recognize if one is stri@@ ction against any form of damage .
also here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an ab@@ sur@@ d , un@@ propor@@ tional meaning , and the typical acts of violence riv@@ eting the military police are cut from head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators at the con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
the villages of the ab@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ ization of the villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Álvar@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane fac@@ tories came to the doors of Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ equ@@ e , is widely known as el Central and Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no not@@ able sugar born locally .
it is two years ago when the activities in sugar cane fac@@ tories were laid .
after setting the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory lost its plants , until only the s@@ caff@@ old out of steel and concrete remained .
some 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
others re@@ signed and comm@@ ute to the fac@@ tories , which are still m@@ illed .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stand every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn &apos;t smoke its sleep .
he heard that it is in the east of the sugar cane factory fabri@@ cs , which have been put into operation after a long in@@ active time because they were preserved .
that was something he was not expected .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would have received the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the Pl@@ ages , the Case of Soci@@ alism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ ic@@ itude , the bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harvest is no longer a surprise .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway bridge of the village saw better times .

the crus@@ hing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necess@@ ity : the 155 sugar cane fac@@ tories were techn@@ ically un@@ folding , and hardly any competition they were in@@ trag@@ eous for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient fac@@ tories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the fac@@ tories , which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the mot@@ ives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plants and the sugar be@@ ats on the global market .
non@@ eth@@ eless the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar should remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
if the present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar value would amount to around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day is going to enter into history , &quot; those were the first words of Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ elsewhere .
from then on , the process of re@@ structuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane fac@@ tories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as a soldier , says it is about the closing of the factory , the word that he is in most repeated , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ d@@ ents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to receive the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
prior to the first half year , the first letters began .
it was official and official documents that are only removed regarding parts that would be removed , add@@ res@@ see and date .
everyone was signed by Ul@@ f Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve each withdrawal .
from there the responsibility was over and the letters were becoming more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ closed factory for two years and he was one that received the letters . &quot; the country had no money &quot; insured in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old waiting for reti@@ rement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the l@@ act@@ ment of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he demonstr@@ ates one of his 31 years of employment .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ places has been er@@ ased .
in many inst@@ ances there were no altern@@ atives to work places and services that generated plants in the churches , where they were found .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present persons saw that he had guaranteed that for those areas , whose fac@@ tories were no longer in operation since five years .
price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane fac@@ tories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extrac@@ ted only high by Mah@@ len .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory lock , or better said when they began to dis@@ close them , they also heard the road to asph@@ alted , also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other fac@@ tories .
they became to spare parts .
without future pro@@ spect , many young people left the region as well .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
in late 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
Ne@@ un@@ rounded forty har@@ vest@@ ing the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in reti@@ rement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Lord N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a trag@@ ant person , yet he gives the lies which you told him not .
they have been touring it for ten years .
N@@ ene comes in Ren@@ te with 65 years , not because it is lack@@ ing force , but because he is forbidden .

first Nations Youth people use Hip @-@ Hop to express and maintain their own culture
photo of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos; we Jin@@ an .
youth of the first Nations @-@ Communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . do they have hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop courses directly to schools and youth centers in order to bring youth groups s@@ ong@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were guided by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ d@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Que@@ bec , with ten C@@ ree @-@ Communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The North@@ stars .
the workshop continues to conclu@@ de that young participants in talks as &quot; cultural identity , language , con@@ front@@ ation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or what is always found in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where y@@ outh@@ s are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations @-@ Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and has been invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Ne@@ bras@@ ka in the US state of Ne@@ bras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the K@@ its@@ h@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , in which almost two do@@ zen were mostly indi@@ gen@@ ous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate , as important the receipt of traditional customs and customs - despite the influence of global@@ ization .
many of the songs were published in indi@@ gen@@ ous languages , though the yo@@ ungst@@ ers have not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation added , ref@@ rain will be sung at C@@ ree .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group who gave them a st@@ anza in dial@@ ect eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Fac@@ eboo@@ k@@ side of N &apos; we Jin@@ an is available to the st@@ anza in Um@@ schrift , as well as translation into English , which is translated to German :
sometimes I feel when nobody ever would interest to me
but I will try to go on earth for my days
that is the day you will take our scre@@ am
because as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
they can grow up and to our youth as well .
thus they can do this , wher@@ ein she has appointed the Creator
in the comm@@ entary eil the reader and suppor@@ ter of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a contribution and add the st@@ anza in sil@@ icon writing ( which is also published on his blog ) :
in Japan plastic gro@@ wers are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( eg@@ . so . ) outside of typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan one can see plastic meals almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers show what exactly on the menu is located near the entrance of sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( gir@@ der , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of any food which is served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic light weights , then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is an entire industry devoted to the production of this plastic counter@@ weights .
in the Tokyo District Jud@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes made by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic od@@ ds are usually so usual that they will not catch them again . however , a new trend is trans@@ forming today in normal mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ g@@ in@@ ii series of social media links and photos depic@@ ting this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new items decorated with plastic coating , such as they are shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji to@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects such as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a couple of Sho@@ ku@@ hin cold magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in Essen@@ ti@@ bility is becoming increasingly el@@ abor@@ ate .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with se@@ afood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this dirty bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we also made this part in the Tokyo Station .
and here is a apple that contains your mobile :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of a growing flight into the coming .
some mobile support and cell designers allow you to produce your own art@@ work . in this case ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , a popular T@@ opp@@ ing which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their dou@@ b@@ ts :
there is someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile with salmon roe ? . &quot;
I think , I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic stories can also accept a less app@@ et@@ ite form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile stand has the form of mel@@ odi@@ c ice .
furthermore , travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon are also available .
more sk@@ im@@ si@@ cal plastic gro@@ cer@@ ies can view yourself under : it@@ in@@ ii &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter from the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 , etc .
if you like to know more about the origin of this trends , this video will give you an in@@ sight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi District , dedicated to the restaurant industry . like for example with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic counter@@ weights are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of struggle against the drug tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ er . &quot;

in reports and foreign media on the not@@ or@@ ious &quot; struggle against the drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king in Mexico , the missed and killed regularly in statistics . these mir@@ rors are regularly not reflected in the extent of the human trag@@ edy that brings together this struggle .
the coverage of drug gi@@ ants such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
on the day after a viol@@ ent first , som@@ eb@@ ody looks at the har@@ vest@@ ed or to the con@@ greg@@ ations which have learned to live with pain .
we are standing behind every body , behind every bone reser@@ voir discovered in the hundreds of dar@@ ken@@ ed tom@@ bs , the stories of count@@ less parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wo@@ unds might be he@@ al .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico created the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Viv@@ ir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( german : &quot; with drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king &apos; ) , which is told by a voice saying to these victims and stories of people att@@ ained in the struggle between the prosec@@ ution and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only fear us to fear our lives .
the effects are a lot of pro@@ found .
for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ff@@ ers and all the municip@@ alities are therefore many kilometers to buy some so simple as milk .
the pain of the sacrifice
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que c@@ amb@@ ian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( german : &quot; as fear is changed &quot; ) exactly these stories .
a main character is the Guadal@@ upe , a father that is looking for every weekend secret gra@@ ves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father &apos;s four si@@ bl@@ ings , lost her husband and two ne@@ phe@@ w .
Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task we decided to go out and to gra@@ ves for the people who we loved to look . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ er@@ as Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a El N@@ aran@@ jo factory .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is still my mother , who also is with me here .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are dealing with the insurance of my Father , but they don &apos;t get paid out because they require a certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
Ed@@ itors from &quot; Apr@@ ender a Viv@@ ir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have the faces of those who represent fear . we have to lead the international community the conflic@@ ts and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extrac@@ ts from the stories .
KY@@ HB , a writer from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , State Guer@@ r@@ ero in Central Dalmatia .
your contribution is remin@@ is@@ cent of us that violence should never look as normal , no matter what it occurs :
I know disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism now already since several years .
I pass each day to newspaper k@@ is@@ ks and see the title page with pictures , that can only come from a textbook on cri@@ min@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it will bring me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who sad@@ dens or sad . it seems like a lack of respect toward the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be equal or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old co@@ us@@ in thin@@ ks that he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs through the &quot; her@@ o@@ sia &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who have fear that something happens to them too .
I see our weak@@ ness when stories to blo@@ ws numbers in a statistic .
the crime of man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students are justified in a neighbor@@ ing town that they were sin@@ ned . &quot;
I think they don &apos;t think that they spar@@ ed from such trag@@ e@@ dies if they are not stirring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the Capital District : like a family with thre@@ ats , it was de@@ pressed for month money of her business until the end didn &apos;t only destro@@ ys the business , but also her family torn apart .
you think about everything you lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never leaves , trau@@ ma remains , the fear rise again high if you are alone .
hab@@ its changed , phone numbers have also changed .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed from each other , the better .
they completed their report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they &apos;re kid@@ n@@ apped or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether W@@ ah would cry out my deeply ro@@ oted feelings , but the reply is no , for I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the &quot; The For@@ g@@ otten Kids from Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation by violence . &quot;
in introduction he ra@@ ises questions about how : who car@@ es about the child of a mis@@ er@@ able woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime ?
what &apos;s it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like the other boy of his age , whose parents tend to take care of them .
Bry@@ an is a f@@ ather@@ less and he told that he had to teach himself how to make a egg cook , potatoes cooked , tortillas warm and &quot; ch@@ ichi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he talks about the nine scar@@ ves on his left leg - one for every living year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ promising for a boy for the whole life of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , man told him that his mother had van@@ ished .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood already past two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody Le@@ iche of his father saw that had shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bry@@ an was born , the situation looked like in Ju@@ á@@ rez like this :
Bry@@ an was born in 2006 when violence was organised by organised crime and struggle with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders for public safety and government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ ution filed 3@@ 103 Mor@@ se . this equ@@ als 8.5 mor@@ den per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories still live in the head@@ lines . this project remin@@ ds us of those who we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Viv@@ ir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; initiated the data Journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against the drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king over the country that has tort@@ ured the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring &apos;s Car@@ ing &quot; of the Flick@@ r user Nik@@ las Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ NING : this post and the pages that it links to whom he is linked to which violence is shown .
the facsimile check is important in a moment in which it is about raising a rum@@ or to dis@@ lar@@ v@@ ate a f@@ ake .
but how is the years after something that emerged in social media ? content in social media , whether or true , t@@ ends to pers@@ ist further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication it was used ir@@ re@@ voc@@ ably to cultiv@@ ate trag@@ e@@ dies , which actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; false text &quot; or &quot; false text &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - does not den@@ y the fact that there are much more careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but he ra@@ ises questions about our long@@ ing to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a t@@ ank@@ vehicle crossed the place S@@ que@@ es in the east of the DR Congo , collap@@ sed and explo@@ ded . 230 people came in life .
after the civil war , Africa was ne@@ gle@@ cted in the second largest country for years and thus dev@@ ast@@ ated the streets in the region have become more dangerous str@@ ands , which were difficult to drive .
the tank car fell victim to the victim .
the authorities of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , the do@@ zens of houses , including a cinem@@ as near , which was full of people that looked at the World Cup .
the houses burned and burned corp@@ ses were sc@@ attered in the streets .
many people were burned to the in@@ sights .
a picture with the title &quot; Das is Nigeria . &quot; vom Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the pre@@ set form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
an example is for this .
it shows the lost body , which are caught on the floor during the floor .
but here the story does not end their end .
over the years the same photo was caught on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but don &apos;t fal@@ sely attributed to trag@@ e@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am remote village of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ st@@ ically from atro@@ cities where they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were put in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody stayed there to count corp@@ ses , &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch .
many have been buried , shot and burned .
only on the basis of satellite pictures , the folder could be depic@@ ted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Niger and the attempt at Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo again shows as proof of the fact that the possible degree of attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false descriptions ; Africa check @-@ arran@@ gements has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was given as a cover for mass@@ ages .
another step further will bring personal comments such as this example , from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture of S@@ ange spoke in connection with the dead@@ ly persec@@ ution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a bl@@ itz@@ ation , published by the United Nations , imp@@ acts , imp@@ acts , r@@ ape and several dead , are caused by burning .
while others reported from the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts writes like the following to summar@@ ize these descriptions with photos from the DR of Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian &apos;s message . in 2012 , the President of My@@ an@@ mit@@ ars &quot; s alle@@ ged , mon@@ ks and polit@@ icians had participated in the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition she had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information .
the original edition , which was last access@@ ed on 26 April 2017 , can be access@@ ed here .
other syn@@ erg@@ ents , the AF@@ P as their source , also had also attributed to The@@ in His testimony , but did not get the image from the DR Congo .
the world @-@ wide range of false data
traces of these false cou@@ plings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far information can be exceeded .
an over@@ turned image search by the search engine of Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures , shown in the picture above the picture taken from the DR of Congo ( May 3 , 2017 ) .
they come from a mixed cycl@@ ist private pages , platforms of social media and community service and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to dis@@ lar@@ v@@ ae the counter@@ fe@@ its .
we have bor@@ dered some examples of the ab@@ usive use and associated with the countries on which page they were published . thus , we want to represent the range clearly than by language only .
several examples of mis@@ use cases can be used from the lower listed countries ( in some cases ) .
here are some cases that are still fully spot@@ ted ( on the card in orange ) :
card : News frames .
country examples of false copies of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ ange@@ y countries refer to pages or server through the examples of counter@@ fe@@ it or fal@@ si@@ ders are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also due to counter@@ fe@@ it .
as a memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

this article by students who have been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am news site An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explic@@ itly stated that the image is not from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ sch@@ i@@ ha@@ dist@@ an attack . &quot;

the picture of the DR Congo is equipped with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and caused a discussion among Muslims after the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am mass@@ acre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were held on the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams , a greater vig@@ il@@ ous attention .
United States , 2015 .
the image has been revealed as a cover for the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am mass@@ acre ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were connected with them were taken up in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to create attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .

in all these cases , the picture was clearly published after the original case of 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description but the original contribution is not available or access@@ able .
frames and pictures
there are two strong issues or frames ( inter@@ lude ) that cap@@ tive this post@@ ings . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of large discussions about the silence of Muslims through Muslims or by Muslims - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming is used to discuss how an African life is evaluated in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth@@ while to exam@@ ine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a de@@ eper question is , however , what happens if readers can no longer serve this pictures .
there are sevent@@ y people with social media , which acc@@ id@@ ently made a proportion of pract@@ ising the water around a trag@@ edy .
suggest@@ s this mood of the false and false declar@@ ations that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and for@@ ger@@ ies the real atro@@ cities of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of viol@@ ent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here , for example ) .
an argument is that the back of images of a ref@@ us@@ al is equivalent to recognize the trag@@ edy . sometimes these images are even asked by the victims itself .
at the same time , worry , that viol@@ ent images and spect@@ ators are des@@ ol@@ ate and identify them the ability to feel emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study that investig@@ ates how viol@@ ent media influence the others ) .
while there &apos;s a lot about viol@@ ent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact , fact that they are in@@ dispens@@ able for today &apos;s news coverage .
Techn@@ olog@@ ists experiment with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; , in which a picture is suggest@@ s slightly , but in which a picture is being c@@ ashed away from the context , or completely ab@@ usive species can be used .
an application of false deb@@ ts should be considered as internationally as internationally as internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of small languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ m@@ ons uses CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. , un@@ ob@@ serv@@ able ) , language des@@ ir@@ able to offer words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to transl@@ ate themselves .
such words are available in every language : they express specific situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these in@@ dispens@@ able words are known today ( like the famous Portuguese asp@@ ir@@ ations ) and others , which are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish s@@ ob@@ taining ) .
but everyone res@@ ist persist@@ ent every experiment of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient to understand why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected during a long time in an online list .
most of these lists are Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog , for example words of the Fin@@ ishing lap of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ an your parents in recognition of how to make yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language which are spoken in parts of Brazil , like :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness , which you feel after it has been war@@ med up in cold days in the sun .
in Birds own words from his blog About :
they escape other cultures , reveal others , and cur@@ ls our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes , you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the l@@ ingu@@ ists on this site and show more of this &quot; in@@ dispens@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; , which are highly appreci@@ ated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite songs .

how Sri Lanka and the worst floo@@ ding of the decade comes
the island of Sri Lanka is currently the worst floo@@ ding and cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic flo@@ ods in this decade .
trig@@ gered by the mon@@ soon , who normally places the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ lio O@@ ya in 15 bor@@ oug@@ hs in the south and west of the country over the shore .
after a statement by the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missed due to the flo@@ ods and mud la@@ wn .
over 400 000 people have been affected ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe residence .
the ra@@ inf@@ all left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the distances in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene standards of the population constit@@ ute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible territ@@ ories .
the following images and videos make an impression of the extent of the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic disaster :
high water in Ta@@ or@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .

the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue inter@@ actions and five are made for transportation to transportation and included in their over@@ floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also clar@@ ified themselves to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od VI@@ C@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster relief - Information Desk@@ - Sri Lanka provides important information about flood situation and humanit@@ arian aid .

the Tax@@ ir@@ uf app Pick@@ er ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the Catal@@ onia Centre will be inform@@ al .
last year following the crash of Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; High @-@ Water A@@ id &quot; button to call it a &quot; High @-@ Water A@@ id &quot; button , a vehicle for the collection of help and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ an@@ ic Red Cross .
as well , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which had no more than thousands of inqu@@ iries and 150 successful boat rescue campa@@ igns for high @-@ water and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civil population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhau@@ sted , for people in need to provide support in need and provide assistance .

I mig@@ t@@ .D@@ am@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bour &apos;s friend and friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me with her children : she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we call par@@ ole for the rights of women .
in the next trend we are right for trans@@ form@@ ying .
we are located in a sea of umbrel@@ las and people , some hold the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound from an American flag , other sc@@ ar slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ h@@ ness .
my girl@@ friend look forward to me and say , &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; I wonder .
I have already led these entertainment .
people with whom I work or people who &apos;ve been to know me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; which has built up in their concept .
she mis@@ ses me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we do practice our religion differ@@ ently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim , on different art . but somehow we all will be put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective concept that as soon as Muslims who do not fit there .
dis@@ mis@@ ses will be mis@@ ed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
that even happened to the poet , whose poetry is to be sold in America by Rum@@ i .
what images come in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I am now , he was a Orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and sch@@ olar .
and Islam , the Kor@@ an , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western vision religion Rum@@ is deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the induc@@ tion images of Muslims , west books already colonial centuries for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man who should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Sa@@ id dissolved the history behind these images in the 197@@ 0s .
but these pictures still occup@@ y today .
it continues to stand out our polit@@ icians , the news industry and Hollywood .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I &apos;ve seen how to domin@@ ate such powerful , incor@@ rec@@ t n@@ arc@@ ades .
this sc@@ rap is the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their lands , while the United States could not even choose their first female pre@@ sidential candidate .
this scar@@ city she@@ ds to know that if French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered to wear their head@@ scarf in public buildings and forced sour women to cover their entire body , both sides of the same coin .
the mighty group ex@@ erts &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this powerful Nar@@ r@@ ative is pregnant women to conduct the movements for change .
it is across the fact that the first Muslim pra@@ yers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought to slave b@@ ays .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has occupied our collective imag@@ ination of such deeply and fl@@ a@@ wed that often S@@ asha males and children become an@@ tif@@ ung@@ al attacks and ch@@ ic@@ king .
due to these stories we tell and because of the kind in which we tell them is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to summar@@ ize the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I want to explain that .
I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born only then in my imag@@ ination , when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious lives , take them back to the following terms : belief , conduct , and sad@@ ness .
my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ors may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe I would see my friend , my neigh@@ bour , my rock in the fire that I am Muslims when it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the final rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kill them in my arms and her the Arabian verses becomes the refuge for the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat each of them three times .
I ask , that they are protected from evil , evil that you can see and evil that can not be seen .
my Muslim faith is probably not always visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .

sad@@ ness is the image of my grand@@ mother , mater@@ nal , with their sisters , as they win a competition of the art of fl@@ oral @-@ arranged in Kar@@ achi for decades .

Muslims must be said to speak the pra@@ yers who told me when I had a bad day .
Muslims must be in it as she brought me to God : Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who was colon@@ ised across the centuries - by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; colon@@ ized , a company with the name Ehr@@ able British Ost@@ in@@ idi@@ en @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie was , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .

affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palest@@ in@@ ians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , were torn apart from colonial amb@@ itions which have shared the Muslim world as the game risk .
Muslims therefore means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans were all colon@@ ised by four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial photo of history was rejected over a century on a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an ind@@ ent , Kash@@ mir her@@ tan of British imperi@@ alism , from the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; he led the first mos@@ que in England .

but I &apos;m concerned about this difficult global schedule , where we are in .
and at this moment , consequences did go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for con@@ spir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ist who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
she had not been given a few years ago ; now they rule large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am wor@@ ried about the real@@ ities and the history of which I was so old when I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but who made me to live in an un@@ comm@@ itt@@ y Muslims .
things I have left here like a bread guy in my speech .
things that might look up memories , because in all the inter@@ section who makes our humanity , a story can lau@@ gh , where som@@ eb@@ ody is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berk@@ ele@@ y you will find Con@@ vers@@ ations in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ h@@ d@@ iness .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; struc@@ tive rac@@ ism , and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
these are not the terms , with which we usually throw in our schools in our schools , or we can read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why I tell this about this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , Edward Sa@@ id , who has demonstrated us how wars are led us , as wars are led to us such as wars are being conducted by the Sch@@ affen in the public presentation , four decades ago by Stan@@ ford .

initiative for nar@@ r@@ ative art wants to preserve urban bi@@ odi@@ versity
stor@@ yt@@ elling told , of Flick@@ r @-@ users Dan@@ iele Rossi , under the use of the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be any way to get in touch with someone in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , the founder of the Rel@@ ay Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in her original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the In@@ transl@@ ator Blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on a spoken word . it is a try to obtain and appreci@@ ated the diversity of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not dis@@ closed to the children born there .
for the M@@ acher of the project :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we need to accept the diversity - secure spaces , in which residents do not forget , who they are to listen to da@@ iries .
while listening is often associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story in their own language and transl@@ ate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are no professional history , their de@@ vot@@ ion and their representation is that the audience agree on it .
they call for laughter and emotions , when language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows like a traditional history of Burkina Faso who is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ ellers in Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou con@@ forms also the opportunity to explain the typical con@@ du@@ its of nar@@ r@@ ative art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ abel of the rab@@ bit and the v@@ ell@@ as in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explains the importance of his f@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to a crowd who does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad Grin@@ ding he shares his feel of the In@@ kl@@ ah@@ ity :
you have not heard !
they were very atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project , can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico requested by US re@@ define the state school
with the aim of a re@@ alisation of the public deb@@ ts of Puerto Rico , which took place on 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 , along with the puer@@ tor@@ ian Capit@@ ol , the capit@@ ol building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was pro@@ claimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Aud@@ itor@@ ía de la De@@ uda &quot; ( Civil Front for the ne@@ ur@@ ality of the deb@@ ts ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ian congregation of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the adv@@ oc@@ ate of the deb@@ ts of the debt have also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Ric@@ os calls that the polit@@ icians , banks and government agencies , responsible for deb@@ ts , are responsible for their corruption .
we demand a financial ex@@ am and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions compensation , which is in@@ dispens@@ able in the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not decrease with mer@@ cen@@ aries .
we charge immediate measures .
the island - not into the stat@@ ut@@ ory of the Federal Republic of the United States - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party membership , with focus on soci@@ ology economic development , a law for citi@@ zen@@ ship , as an alternative to existing state intelligence .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide re@@ structuring of the state infrastructure .
external measures shall be carried out without the Partic@@ ip@@ ation and convic@@ tion of citizens of danger , to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; Night &apos;s Re@@ ven@@ ge for Light and Truth . &quot;

this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , is dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel Camp@@ a@@ ign .

the book that was published last year and is licensed free here , includes a number of ess@@ ays that deals with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is a hom@@ age to base and his work .
in the background it is called :
this book would discuss how movements for fre@@ ies are built and what the real costs are linked to which this is associated with .
activ@@ ists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who have involved in the movements for fre@@ ies have been working on page to view over the ne@@ b@@ ula and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been im@@ prisoned since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted by the E@@ dra prison camp , where he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we have no information about its current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory portion of his book with the title Colle@@ c@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice acting on his release and that they want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel paid a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us can begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why Are We Here ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of tim@@ ely belie@@ fs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activity has been in det@@ ention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel came from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyers N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , said that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that on 12 November 2015 they had been cont@@ acted by persons that themselves as in@@ sider from the Assad government and continued it from an alle@@ ged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia played a decisive role in expanding the Internet and to know the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ olog@@ ous , and moment@@ ary of the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps not one of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototyp@@ es predic@@ ted as the work began to renov@@ ate with a group of archae@@ ologist and 3D artists around 2005 to renov@@ ate the ancient ruins of Palm@@ yr@@ as virtu@@ ell .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the sign of numerous civilians and here merged with Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Per@@ sian influences .
Bas@@ sel was still not knowing that ten years after being started with this work , the IS would set it all about it , this architecture that not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage but the world em@@ bo@@ died .
this strip of digital arch@@ e@@ ology and the preser@@ vation has created a time of time that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
Bas@@ sel was not able to close this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life , dre@@ aming of liber@@ ty and scri@@ be taught me to embr@@ ace her .
I am overwhel@@ med if I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already det@@ ention .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked him to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened my gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he has also contributed to other det@@ ention how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they had actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a commission that she wrote her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a collabor@@ ated along with the book for one year .
she sm@@ elled the lyrics to him when she visited him , and translated it from the Arabic to English .
the book is licensed free .
book covers Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens :
it happens at every visit ,
I sing in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the b@@ ag@@ ulation in the moment we embr@@ ace in which we embr@@ ace us ,
that any of the dang@@ ers doesn &apos;t matter me ,

I carry this with my passion ,

those who were arrested or disappeared by the regime , were tort@@ ured or even executed .

we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption , condemned director back to previous post by dis@@ mis@@ er@@ able post
Mos@@ ambi@@ que responded to anger upon a ru@@ in fall , when a government member returned to the workplace in the state appar@@ atus , where the corruption turned over .
in this case , Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , the 2008 was arrested and sentenced together with four other def@@ end@@ ants for 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years in prison .
the money was composed of public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , their Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately ordered his back to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the Secretary of Office of the Republic , the proposed application , there would be no obst@@ acle to rel@@ ate to Cam@@ b@@ aza , as the company had no discipl@@ ine procedure after his det@@ ention .
however , many citizens are not doing well .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , &quot; CIP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , sentenced to an interview with the Deutsche Welle , the decision of the firm to re@@ loc@@ ate the director :
pos@@ es a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and indicates lack of transparency and is even a step ahead to the efforts of our right system , so that CIP .
what we know is that the company should in@@ duce a discipl@@ ine procedure against the trade @-@ trade .
however , the company was silent , however , and causes no reasonable steps to use the respective functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim &apos;s social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also as &quot; res@@ ist &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a compet@@ ent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them .
he could observe lectures and motiv@@ ating things , he could advise and his image pol@@ ishing .
but since he is in@@ compet@@ ent , he is granted to become integrated in the company , who helped to add damage .
thus it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is to be paid for his silence .
res@@ ist !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ que and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn &apos;t have any moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza are rewarded from the state because he cannot believe him that someone claims someone in such a way that has already ins@@ ul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks mor@@ als to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only in the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state when it was a f@@ aint financial source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was up@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was re@@ warding .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to re@@ mind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to re@@ mind that a th@@ ief belong to the prison :
the th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , one @-@ cutting and inc@@ ident@@ ally - prop@@ he@@ tic speakers .
one of his most famous represent@@ ations , it was energetic so that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of to sell his own individual interest in his amb@@ itions . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he won &apos;t turn away from his amb@@ itions .
an honest man is also criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were ref@@ using :

Facebook rec@@ alls the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and is cen@@ sored many users to in@@ justice
the bur@@ mes@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or a switch b@@ osses .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their post@@ ings out of the net because they played the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or in general as an ad@@ jec@@ tive &quot; Indian &quot; .
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ ial script ) as part of an initiative to deal the widespread problem of speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radi@@ cal national movements of the word has given an extremely low @-@ cur@@ ing c@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a speech against Muslims who constit@@ ute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in terms of Bem@@ an , Hass@@ language in Myanmar , the company has licensed a lot of sen@@ sible content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; is usually associated with rac@@ ism , but the word remin@@ ding doesn &apos;t call an enemy language .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Po@@ sts in which they discussed use of the word or dou@@ b@@ ts two of its use as used .
there are several bur@@ m@@ ese words with different significance to have the same sequence of letters like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spin@@ ach ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eboo@@ k@@ User A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the various significance of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however he had asked his friends on spiritual way if he could overcome his back pain when he made a word game .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + Frag@@ ran@@ ch ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ aller is the opinion that she will kill an enemy of radi@@ cal nation@@ alists , but it also emphas@@ ized that Facebook analy@@ tical Look out before all the Po@@ sts abol@@ ished , rac@@ ism to spread ter@@ rac@@ ism .
Facebook qu@@ en@@ ched the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it will be fil@@ tering the word automatically .
Autom@@ at@@ ism will not understand what you read on Facebook .
what it should take instead is the post carefully to analy@@ ze and control it by using the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( switch ) .
the good thing is that this dre@@ aded nation@@ alists are broad@@ ly sp@@ reading a quite good lesson .
now it is at time to cut their nation@@ alism .
while the action is a strong signal to all send an enemy bugs , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long .
the experiences of social networks in China as S@@ ina Female and We@@ Chat found that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship will often have a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networking will begin to use a new word , or an alternative write system of the zen@@ used word to express their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ at described as Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts when he wanted to share his friends when he is forbidden to the Word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
Iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook , and I was forbidden to talk to me , posts and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; has not been talking about &quot; the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts of people who have no negative sus@@ cep@@ tions or that just try to show their opinions against the speech of radi@@ cal nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with enemy :
post without enemy &apos;s speech is removed from Facebook .
in the post the author convic@@ ted his opinion , why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are po@@ or@@ ly bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believed that Facebook should have more done before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask advice :
Facebook Like a ben@@ evol@@ ent inten@@ tion to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
to aging such words will only bring more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it also appears as if they have begun this without local context or technical support , such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Er@@ bs@@ enc@@ ur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found it , they did not tried to rec@@ tif@@ y the vul@@ ner@@ able post@@ ings .
if they had just a little bit of respect for the 15 million benefit they would have a great success , would be the great .
Fac@@ eboo@@ ks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship provided for a lot of fun among users .
rather than taking it seriously , users are aware of Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ language to see whether their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which did not abst@@ speech but nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and se@@ at@@ ly view a Indian movie .
just to try if Facebook is the mail removed , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

the post owner &quot; If you are a doctor , do you he@@ al ? &quot;

in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists , social networks have been used to expand their voices and influence .
in addition , an enemy language in social networks will also continue to heat violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the region of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have been forced to escape .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to critic@@ ise his conf@@ ident speech at his in@@ mes@@ ial pages .
but instead of aging the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running on the context of the focus of concentr@@ ating initi@@ atives and learned from them .

statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the number of children that were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 per cent .
in 2011 , the Federal Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that were cont@@ ested to take the laws on the foot , followed by great support . no doubt they helped to join this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smooth@@ ly .
a Hin@@ du guide , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of children &apos;s sex , they should take care of her own business . &quot;
this sort of religious opposition car@@ ed for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point , doubt , whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but in early 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite four Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who abst@@ ained - so he could be discussed in the office building where a simple majority would cause it to be a law .
now only the President of the country must vote and pro@@ claim the law .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators found on Facebook a Status update which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the Bill &apos;s Bill against the Children &apos;s House was approved by the House of Re@@ present@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against them .
after being previously decided in the Senate , the draft may now be made to the law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws have been modified for children .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who sent a minister of the ministry of education , said :
it has become too much time and un@@ necessary talk to deter@@ ior@@ ated the core of the thing , but you know what ? the marriage is now Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is worth every price .
while Abel Jackson &apos;s mind , there was definitely long enough to take care of the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e - Thomas , which is said : News , outstanding news !
the ad@@ ul@@ tery has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against you ! ! ! ! &quot;
fol@@ lowers Mut@@ ota , listen@@ ed to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society which is quite open@@ ly said about how important the ad@@ option of the law is said :
the full age of age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years regardless of the religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the amend@@ ment has been approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members of the House of Re@@ present@@ atives , 35 of them present at the voting .
the de@@ pu@@ ties , which were against the law , have agreed to the law .
the marriage is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago no longer allowed .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # . mar@@ ri@@ age@@ isch@@ il .
many thanks to all activ@@ ists who challeng@@ ed him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook is based in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organisation of the country .
before months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj had announ@@ cing his inten@@ tion to take judi@@ cial steps , the law should be adopted , and it seems to be his promise to come true .

Patricia Dos@@ rell bo@@ g :
dear Sat , if we don &apos;t want to talk about this discussion in a way that we are not allowed to speak of the state in our bedrooms , that they may not be mis@@ used by big , hard @-@ car@@ rot men who are against them , would you then be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not about a problem ?
but whether it happens to a judi@@ cial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there is still places around the world , on which the children in different gra@@ d@@ ations leg@@ ally or continue the norm , although there are laws that they teach .

through the wings of websites , Turkish users can return to Wikipedia content .
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia site was presented on 18 January 2012 , op@@ posed to the SO@@ PA ( stop on Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dar@@ ken@@ ed .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey closed the popular and crow@@ ds @-@ based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information , as well as reliable information .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV series defend themselves against the pl@@ ywood .
although many techn@@ ic@@ ted Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass dies for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times article that Turkey does not have the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , the most usual Wikipedia users don &apos;t drop to this category .
although Turkey has been un@@ locked in 2002 article by Wikipedia , as recently as a published report by Berk@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Har@@ vard University , you will find regular block@@ ys of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been issued .
China is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are several mir@@ rors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform re@@ lies all Turkish Wikipedia sites on a de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ Network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator ) which does not support a whole Z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , the content remains ob@@ serv@@ able , however .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reported about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the crossing of Wikipedia ) , we replaced it all about , sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents in the centr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to see at least all the Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ w@@ ikipe@@ di@@ a.org myself .
IP@@ FS was also shown that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent sperm .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ ce@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ k@@ ian@@ si@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ site of Wikipedia , as well as W@@ iki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use similar mir@@ rors pages , when on the respective country Wikipedia is blocked , high@@ lighted .
Con@@ ce@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a Mir@@ ror .
you are att@@ acking another URL , which is not the original . that what one sees , is from Wikipedia .
essenti@@ ally the server runs the request to the right Wikipedia site , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia himself , if they are closed in Turkey .
for this is done by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Ne@@ pal@@ ese wild@@ life photograph@@ ed his camera to focus on the need for nature con@@ servation
a su@@ cking r@@ hin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around himself , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ended with bad@@ ly positioned mot@@ ives and balanced colours .
it &apos;s motiv@@ ated to carry him a camera on himself and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar decided to bring home to the international stage .
and his h@@ omet@@ own right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that len@@ ken attention to Ne@@ p@@ ala .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location as@@ si@@ sts in his work :
I live at the Rand of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passion@@ ate wild@@ life photograph@@ ers ! !
I rested from home , when suddenly Nav@@ ar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Ga@@ ida Lodge ) had called me . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I got rid of my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river @-@ side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ack images ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves for cooperation with the authorities to achieve global recognition of Ne@@ p@@ als nature and would like to understand that wild animals are not so ter@@ rif@@ ying as they look like .
and he should know it , for he stood for tig@@ ers already from face to face :
a tiger may not be distur@@ bing by the mind of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was in the dark on the way home , when suddenly the king of Bus@@ h@@ men appeared . he immediately went , and let us go and he star@@ ves me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar won the Logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for Ecology ) on his photos .
but its passion for the promotion of Ne@@ p@@ als nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited 22 days long and lived in a tent in order to make music from Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds , which live near the tourist arri@@ vals .
see some of these photos below .

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az Kal@@ yan@@ wal@@ a and appeared originally on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was again published as part of a Content @-@ Sh@@ aring Agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid care of the greatest care , the name of her husband , or even by older men in the family .
instead , they use a t@@ onom@@ ous or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , to respect women that they should respect the grounds of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should be the norm in life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted from the Indian state of O@@ dis@@ ha by a head@@ court and for@@ c@@ iting her family and the village community after she had brought a married relatives with name .
the tradition of their wives are also not given by name , but is also common among men . however , they have no less out@@ right to fear if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the District P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them heal@@ th@@ ers@@ onal and home fr@@ auen , a unique club and became very quickly became the main anti@@ co@@ us@@ ema of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , discuss the host@@ ess of patri@@ arch@@ s and discuss them .
being one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , who is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and re@@ lies for the removal of patri@@ arch@@ ats .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of her video camera to the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the ex@@ ile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infections , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
they reported how this clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made amb@@ assador of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini presented in her discussion round , was forbidden by women who do not call her husband by name .
she decided on this issue , because she wanted to talk about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , who can easily identify the women .
the name of her husband is not to speak out loud , as they pleaded not guilty on all of them , and never has question@@ ed .
Roh@@ ini un@@ ites :
this tradition proves that a woman likes her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who is not holding this becomes a dece@@ it@@ ful woman , as woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we never did thought until this discussion break .
at start , Roh@@ ini wanted to have never mentioned her husband so far , trying to try out at home as it runs .
she showed her husband &apos;s video at her husband and mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother in law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video had been finished .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned aside to me , and said , I will call him from now on his name .
with this confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
according to video projection the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in gear .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then they all asked , &quot; If we could not tell the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want us to respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband on the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , in which married women must never pron@@ ounce the name of her husband .
Roh@@ ini tells :
one woman was so sh@@ y , that during the whole practice it was just car@@ ed before , and another decided to recover all the built @-@ in fru@@ str@@ ation against him and his family by curs@@ ed him .
the expression of their faces were ec@@ st@@ atically .
I guess I will never forget it again .
even in the ad@@ ren@@ al sw@@ ap , to have broken with an ancient ro@@ b , the women decided they would actually try to call her husband by name .
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini was awarded a multitude of reports .
the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family .
when her mother was silent , she got an@@ xi@@ ety and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini report as women have tried to stop other practices , such as the carrying of the fasc@@ ist point on the fore@@ head , which shows ad@@ ul@@ status :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the fasc@@ ist point , if he would do it also .
he laugh@@ ed only and I listen@@ ed to him to bear him .
the other women have not ce@@ ased to give them completely , but they are now in a better position to be able to carry him on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their views and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about who could hear something , &quot; says it .
for the first time in her life she celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things that they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems so many years ago and I also have some things to hand , for example , like our identity of our hus@@ bands , never actually talked to be honest .
it felt great to say some things , no matter how small it occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and connected to it with clothing .
some women in the group have played a sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it is okay , but some wanted a sage cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , wear ; they did not drink .
after a much disp@@ ute and discussion about the advantages of your own choice , the mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , tast@@ ed Roh@@ ini her own Couple Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirt ) in a discussion break that women were able to wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a while they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is safe to create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their initial discussion club has already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the ro@@ les :
so far we only have small steps .
some women then tried it a few times , but then heard it again to say the name of her husband .
some , shut me , do it still , but only when they are alone and no other family members .
only one or two still say the name of her husband ; only one or two women are now carrying a p@@ inn@@ y red on their fore@@ head .
the women in discussion club know that the changes in their lives would like to achieve greater freedom of movement or your own choice - at the end of a hard to navigate the river .
by giving each other self confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
every one of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am so .
but this club is sent to us that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman comes home in the club and other people talk about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of ab@@ duction of smooth persons for the organ@@ ism , pres@@ u@@ al@@ armed the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government has now called a number of operations into the life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the mil@@ let , few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found guilty and found a part of the organs .
two men were arrested and placed in the ep@@ isode that the organs of sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are explo@@ ited .
there is the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a g@@ atz@@ y man &apos;s gold unve@@ ils old or ri@@ ches , the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered on the FA@@ ST@@ P@@ FI@@ GE men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the purpose of ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation for ob@@ sc@@ ure , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 mission in South African country to investig@@ ate this practice .
the prosec@@ ution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbo@@ uring Tanzania , where the government campa@@ igns had developed to fight these ab@@ norm@@ alities and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ ese in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police have already said :

the persec@@ ution and killing of gl@@ atz@@ ky individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in behalf of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably st@@ itious rit@@ u@@ anas , known as the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , which might have faith in mind , according to which the victims in the head might have generated , the ri@@ chn@@ ess .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Ferreira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ Desk Sn@@ a@@ ipp@@ a , which indicates that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Moz@@ ambi@@ que is facing each other :
I WI@@ LL BE A Moz@@ ambi@@ que , THAT IS CHAN@@ GE A country where men would like to go back on the road or even other services , a nation would not hurt nor even their lives , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os would like to get any vain or &quot; black magic &quot; for super@@ st@@ itious purpose , to get rid of his wealth .

we are deeply affected by experience the death of our friend Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him , and speak our deep con@@ dol@@ ences over his family , his friends , and all those who knew him and loved .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , including Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi ) made a key role in supporting public access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our Arab blo@@ g@@ ger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ que wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was cont@@ acted by persons that themselves bud@@ get@@ ed themselves as in@@ sider the Assad government .
she reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
basic stay and Const@@ itution were unknown to date ( 01 August 2017 ) unknown as N@@ our@@ a of Syrian civil servants that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in future we point out of Bas@@ sel as a pioneer of the Open Web Movement .
and we would appreciate all the efforts and organisations that have been used for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the prot@@ ests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ .000 people have disappeared , so the Organisation / Network for Human Rights .
count@@ less of those who were arrested by the regime or viol@@ ently disappeared , torture and even exec@@ utions are suspended .
between 2011 and 2016 , less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans came to death at the International Human Rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people is unknown .

the following version is published as part of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of det@@ ained Chinese dis@@ sid@@ ents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June , that he was admitted to the hospital because of liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of end@@ ang@@ ering ) after he involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manif@@ esto which was involved in democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .

non@@ eth@@ eless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nob@@ el@@ pre@@ ist@@ räger and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , ac@@ ul@@ ators or his treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the str@@ ing@@ ent treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely well balanced .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Ze@@ id Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Com@@ mission@@ er of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese offici@@ als to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations consi@@ ders pressure to allow Li@@ u to make a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Minister President Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway started to store in 2010 , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it was nothing to do with the decision .
dipl@@ omatic relations were once again continued in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to continue leaving the salmon in China , since the exports had been exten@@ sively blocked since 2010 .
after the news sp@@ reading that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee had to bring his hope for un@@ con@@ ditional release to the expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
because of his arrest , he was unable to receive his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision where China was ur@@ ged to free to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife prompt@@ ly to rid of his house arrest to seek medical support , where he wants .
the top dipl@@ atin in the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , asked China also for the release of Li@@ us as they announced in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all the limit@@ ations of Mr. Li@@ us wife , as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits you wish , and be able to commun@@ icate with the outside world .
USA
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans have asked him for the treatment abroad , whether it was instr@@ umental in his gen@@ esis . &quot;
an spokes@@ person in U.S. emb@@ assy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27 , announced that the message to pick the Chinese authorities , not only Li@@ u free , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia .

Pol@@ ley shared that China should be following the following :
protection and freedom such as travel and access to medical supplies of its choice , which they have to be entitled to according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Rub@@ io , Jeff Mer@@ kle@@ y and Ted Cruz did as well as a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push down Li@@ u and his wife un@@ con@@ ditional .

the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin I hope that Li@@ u gets &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanit@@ arian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping was born on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , dipl@@ omatic sources in Beijing on the news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could be over@@ taken with Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada KO@@ O@@ ZA
on 28 June , the Canadian amb@@ assador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China ur@@ ged to provide an adequate medical care , and to give him the opportunity to provide him with his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police are always monitored by the hospital , and that Li@@ u is not permitted to speak and contact anyone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
Canada calls on China to comply with its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , main@@ taining a stat@@ ut@@ ory rights for use of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China in a statement on 29 June , on the Li@@ u &apos;s humanit@@ arian reasons :
all necessary measures need to be taken to make sure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments , which he needed , ir@@ respective of where , needs his wife and family contact with him .
though the news @-@ channel France info same said that the French government Li@@ u would welcome us back in the land , the foreign ministry demanded that there is no further information out whether France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
the Council of the Coun@@ c@@ tive Opp@@ ort@@ un@@ ities in Taiwan demanded on 27 June on , Li@@ u Fre@@ iz@@ ul@@ assen and a greater tolerance towards those who want to use peaceful resources to challenge political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the gover@@ ning Democratic Party &apos;s Party encour@@ ages China to allow the sick intel@@ lec@@ tu@@ als Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u very wor@@ ried and gave him that many have asked to pray for Li@@ us well .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that he took the initi@@ atives that he took and for whom he had led to a harmon@@ ious , more and we@@ al@@ thy China , which in turn could have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and encour@@ aged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intel@@ lec@@ tual and concerned citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Domaine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem st@@ up@@ id , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark has trig@@ gered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the State &apos;s Association of New York , the Minister said that many people critic@@ ized Domin@@ anz of the only political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore to other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... nobody asked if New York is a democracy ...
this is , where most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Caval@@ ier announced the minister of justice to turn the logic to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and offer@@ ings , this valuable country is to create , we must finally say that there was no country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the indication of a escape from the respon@@ si@@ bilities , a bre@@ ach of oblig@@ ation .
Singapore if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons given by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ c@@ tive : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could make the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given to him , he was in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
however , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York City , al@@ ike towns and permanent cities .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the theme of the River Th@@ ames , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ it@@ arian makers seem to be for@@ given by the prescribed logic , because it fits better to its power .
in the end of this week , we were given answers to his American guests in the last week , regarding our press , our it@@ at@@ ative , our political system is really non @-@ respon@@ ses .
corresponding questions tar@@ iff with non @-@ answers r@@ ational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng challeng@@ ed Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clear his opinion , as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to sw@@ allow .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , thus to which country is our city ...
short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our new K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on their labour to clar@@ ify this point if he was paid highly , in order to be part of the city &apos;s government .
by clicking on the blog his comment , he says concerning the critics that you should begin to read the whole writing of the conference , in order to understand the context of the testimony of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , in which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the booklet .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city , &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections being so un@@ equal to Singapore , even if we look forward to free and just cho@@ ices .
compared to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) .
when he said , Singapore &quot; is no country , it &apos;s obviously not in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment regarding Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who as leader of a her@@ ane generation , makes such pol@@ em@@ ic testimony .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w and the members of the old Gar@@ de that was exp@@ ecting me - or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of Singapore leaders of Singapore I have dou@@ b@@ ts and I am not even sure if he really believes that is really true and conf@@ ident that he def@@ ended .
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review dis@@ covers the vul@@ ner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ gr@@ ug@@ am arguments :
does Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am sent a mistake , or was it a fre@@ ud@@ der di@@ ver ?
if Singapore is no country , we are considered an independent and so@@ vereign state ?
if not , on which country go the so@@ vereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally authentic country and city .
because he plays an important role within the govern@@ mental network , the say@@ ings of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ ina work their military service , but defend only their city , but not their country ?
who must pay the Prime Minister In@@ voices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
that , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the aff@@ ir@@ mation of Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this pro@@ position seems to have a lot of poll@@ ut@@ ures ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we &apos;ve always been a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct .
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked short of his ed@@ itors : what is the most mis@@ used aspect of your residence or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is by Ne@@ vin Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most provided in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , I reply . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his meeting , asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ ans will cook for Americans , when they are held for Americans , but do not distur@@ b it .
for someone who does not know , there are little who distingu@@ ishes us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when travelling .
all dear Canadian .
American however ... .
it was so , when I began travelling 20 years ago , Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th September .
can@@ adi@@ ans have always borne little map@@ le leaves on their baggage to differ from their American neighbo@@ urs .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay couples have been legal in Canada already since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously speak very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is supposed to be regarded as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like this types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
I got many American friends , whom I ad@@ m@@ ire very much .
it would make me nothing if you would like to switch me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first@@ ly , &quot; nice , &quot; being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be a mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ous , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant figure , N@@ ed Flanders , &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( who has their own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can reach .
harm@@ less , i.e. normal and essential to be able to earn attention .
this can be a good thing if un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that pass around .
as far as I go , I would say that the desire to be free and alone , a main organisation of the Canadian .
we tend to concern ourselves for our own business .
what out@@ si@@ ders are called &quot; cute &quot; is perhaps just cool sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility .
can@@ oe don &apos;t often speak about the fence with the neigh@@ b@@ ors .
to give us a warm welcome , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ deau meets the stage in order to show that Canadian had made more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our Prime Minister made Canada too sexy .
music video of a Pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a music video published in Thailand , a music video made that the Jun@@ ta par@@ ody led to power and despite its promise the civ@@ ilian government continued to restore the country .
the new song &quot; dict@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him about his girl@@ friend .
although not explic@@ itly , the music video is in@@ directly linked to the continued military domin@@ ance of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was pra@@ ised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for song was huge success .
within the first three days , the video downloaded was posted on Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 sp@@ ikes .
last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; was blocked by the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; in Thailand , after a group of activ@@ ists watched the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpre@@ ted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to Thai policies , as it keeps in the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta dom@@ ination .
take a look at these images of the video which rel@@ ate to some of the political issues that Thailand in the last three years have been sustain@@ ed .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the temporary Const@@ itution , which granted the com@@ mander of the host of absolute decision making important national topics .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ or@@ ious program for &quot; initi@@ ation &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activ@@ ists , polit@@ icians and other individuals who are considered the critics .
the picture above reflec@@ ts the introduction of the law on computer criminal inten@@ tions , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules often are util@@ ised by the authorities to offset activ@@ ists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , super@@ vised the online content and persons to which the mon@@ archy is sub@@ jected to have been prosec@@ uted .
Thailand counts a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ estic impro@@ per ) .
on 20 May 2014 the mar@@ tial law was pro@@ claimed in Thailand .
two days later there came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta will continue to buy the jun@@ ta &apos;s decision , although safety experts they war@@ ned when buying un@@ necessary and a waste of tax returns .
in the video even shows how people are cast into a black van , before you put them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison because they have rep@@ lied &quot; confusion &quot; in society and they are threat@@ ening long @-@ pun@@ ish@@ ments , they should ins@@ ul@@ ted mon@@ archy .
meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the songs featured the band members of the band produced by Pan@@ em &quot; Tri@@ bute &quot; by Pan@@ em , who was already used by P@@ utsch against the prot@@ ests in 2014 .

the post@@ war society was reco@@ ver@@ ing very slowly in East Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Georg@@ ian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still heavily visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern part in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show prominent pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya , Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ kov@@ ava are located in the carbon bas@@ ins of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sians , Gre@@ eks , shooting Asia , Georg@@ ian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the biggest part of Rus@@ sians and Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ v@@ ases are living in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called spirits in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people still lived here only a few hundred people in these states .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population counts more than 16@@ ,000 people after it had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ .000 people lived in this area .

the empty five @-@ story residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ is@@ cht@@ ow@@ kas , are symbo@@ li@@ cally for the decline and dev@@ ast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dec@@ lining and quite rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native el@@ derly man .
he begins a conversation and it falls to him hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why do we speak ? &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all of the community .
now there is only pav@@ ed road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
people who once lived at this location and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , leaving the bor@@ ough .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v kas , which houses one or two families , can recognize the balconies , where washing is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look from the window of a destroyed house .
when you discover myself with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; our mother forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; she simply forbidden to it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers a girl in her friend , and suddenly they leave the destroyed house and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the administration sector ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as li@@ vest@@ ock , be@@ e@@ keeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come over the laps .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
about ten years ago there was an old woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighbourhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asia in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ asia . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to take financial aid from her daughter , causing them to support her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly ren@@ te are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot;

Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she remin@@ ds of the village of Dor@@ ia .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration building in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but it will take a little more . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets around $ 9 for every child each child .
her husband works in the cal@@ f .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s garden is located once , they keep pig@@ s , co@@ ws , co@@ cks and ch@@ ick@@ ens .
it tells us that it was a very wor@@ r@@ ying situation , as many people left after the war the village left .
but in the course of time , they lost its an@@ xi@@ ety .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of the dark street or a few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has more to do with signs .
after the war there were hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation joins the end , a little boy is pun@@ ished by us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and h@@ ides .
a ball leaves from the window and another boy hun@@ ts him back .
he plays with the ball , which then rolled up the hill .
a group children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw rocks to the falling buildings .
the ruins are part of their childhood , who car@@ es for in@@ tim@@ acy in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; mig@@ rants hosts their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a little hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Brack@@ en was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI@@ .org and is published here .
on the way of mig@@ rants to cross Europe and Latin America , certain locations are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican City Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala .
this is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican , a little woman with a cor@@ all@@ ish @-@ pink diamond frame and gold coloured str@@ uts in te@@ ddy bear form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is ul@@ ged that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans that are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with ground , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Iran@@ ian mig@@ rants come here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s , the people come in full min@@ ibus and from the top part of the coast they start to call : &quot; mo@@ m Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already has 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also slept on boxes .
she wants to ref@@ use any@@ body .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they are bought to them medicines you can not treat them with a bal@@ m that origin@@ ates from long jour@@ neys .
Ty@@ ch@@ ique Sebast@@ iao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable sur@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ iao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ urt ) posing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and ho@@ pes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Brack@@ en .
&quot; Yes , yes , &quot; he reply with a smile . &quot; I feel really that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ iao remains with his sister , ho@@ ping to go to Boston to re @-@ find her husband and three children .
they already lived in Brazil , however , it is for some African leaders that are on the way to the United States , normal to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had a companion of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Mich@@ elet , a guest from Haiti .
he tells the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel the route , and that Afri@@ cans is already talking to Wh@@ ats@@ App on Wh@@ ats@@ App .
like many of his companion Mich@@ elet , Mich@@ elet lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker for the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey into the United States .
for months he is a guest at Mama Africa : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he is in future with Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s future .
&quot; m@@ um Africa is our Mother and we never go again , &quot; he will always sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send their guests a lot of text when they have gone to catch them , or to give her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez may be well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ ks for mig@@ rants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter reached Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family mig@@ rants in their little house .
it is polic@@ eman found that the bus ticket to many African mig@@ rants are to be sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , and then he offered them his house for one dollar a night .
at the moment 25 people are present , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the ground but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and cooking place outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests make .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid at his work place from the United States .
the majority of mig@@ rants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he is fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to press the money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for a accommodation and an unknown , a single owner , offered him of the roof .
a few months later the family lives there and tried to decide where the next steps will go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travel@@ ers get qui@@ et@@ ly to your phones .
a min@@ ibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but it is nost@@ alg@@ ic because of whom we went away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair fill@@ ers who made her a client , some photos of their grand@@ children , and many travel@@ ers more , Young and Old .
she laughs , while she briefly imag@@ ining them .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron &quot; repe@@ ats each time . &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ in@@ jiang residents are forced to install a CCTV app on their phone .
an Check @-@ Point for Personal communication devices at X@@ in@@ j@@ ang from Twitter @-@ Users ( 中@@ 文 ) .
the residents of X@@ in@@ jiang , ethnic minority region in China , are forced to re@@ install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the cell @-@ users entered the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an area of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi a cell @-@ notification if the district government compet@@ ed to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the message is said that the app will hin@@ der to get access to terror@@ ist information . &quot;
but there were the authorities to use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terror@@ ism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed the app , having ex@@ changed messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the announcement of the police , the app would determine the sources and the distribution channels of terror@@ ists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service system with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ age por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fr@@ aud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aler@@ ts how much time they spend online and to remot@@ ely control their own home network .
this app , with the filters for min@@ ors , help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; remote actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers able to manip@@ ulate the home network of a person , or ste@@ al it out .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reports of digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dar@@ ker for those who live in dist@@ ant ethnic minority regions like X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ distur@@ b@@ ances and dis@@ satis@@ faction in conflict regions , the authorities often encounter extreme interest and security measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ingly internet circuits .
based on Twitter based media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( ? ? ) , the cen@@ sored news in China published , showed photos from a Check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen that were inst@@ itutional if they had installed the CCTV app .
the authorities in X@@ in@@ j@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile not@@ ation requested that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you &apos;re detected at a Check@@ point with one device without this software , they could be im@@ prisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they are comp@@ elled to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of bond@@ age due to an investment technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( eg@@ . = &gt; = fee ) . in addition , a J@@ ing@@ .@@ ang product description is out of which the software can capture the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell phones in X@@ in@@ jiang becomes elec@@ tron@@ ical hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have an reaction to the instructions of the City of Par@@ eir@@ as , to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government purposes , Author@@ ities and with the Party associations , including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ed to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office , to operate their computers and communication devices .
a current report from Freedom House , a US American human rights organization , also referred to this new surveillance methods :
in X@@ in@@ jiang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decre@@ e with the order to all the inhabitants and entrepren@@ eurs until 1st August , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable drives , not@@ eboo@@ ks , and media storage cards . &quot;
the inten@@ tion is obviously those &quot; terror@@ ist videos &quot; to identify and destroy them . this action , however , bre@@ eds the personality of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ al@@ ties for a whole series of other potential treaty , including those who refer to peace@@ fully religious or political messages .
sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything moves to death

this is the first of six reports in series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is alle@@ ged his experience in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and st@@ iff sure that you are all alone at one place where everything is gone .
everything has been revealed to and after dissolved and a truth which clearly recogn@@ iz@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes all the glory of her name .
one that has to sett@@ le in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality brings you back up and looking behind the scenes , beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the per@@ former - transform the characters into being made of flesh and blood , and all sh@@ it after death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have me and arrested my father three times , but this was not enough , that I form@@ ulated my lesson &quot; as the b@@ oss of the Security Service - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he made his power over us , by making even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts , which we knew .
five ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was sufficient to create the town the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; - scre@@ am .
all the distri@@ cts were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time , it was quiet , to the wrong time , even if I had no high demand to a city that is pun@@ ished to the ar@@ ter@@ ies with government security and their ac@@ compli@@ ments .
in the third night , things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
I broke through the silence , by which I cried with several times &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house chess .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ age@@ ous enough to summar@@ ize .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed us to a gorgeous image that my expectations full and fulfilled .
in such a moment , you are aware that you fre@@ ed the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not care in the least .
I received a call from my father : &quot; making you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : how much honey you can sw@@ allow yourself - nothing can give you back your voice , after that you have taken the way up to the office of the Security Service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , even as I do .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me listen to how you write &apos; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only bra@@ ve enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot;
his eyes @-@ filled eyes stood on me .
&quot; and you just sit yourself what , look at my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did did did nothing with courage .
I was 18 years old , the fourth time I was standing before this building .
perhaps it was about my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my cause when I said : &quot; I would not thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never stopped to look at you in the eyes , so why would I do it now ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t re@@ gre@@ t word from what I said .
&quot; it holds him in sol@@ itary con@@ fin@@ eness and his father . &quot;
&quot; his father , right with him . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this curs@@ ed sentence is to me in the nose .
he became a syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed to months .
I am crossed the farm .
I leave everything with me in the first office what I carry with me .
then back through the yard and the second office , which leads through one ais@@ le to the individual cells .
I am em@@ brac@@ ed for all details before I enter the room .
otherwise , they probably have assigned a bigger cell in this time .
I have to share it with only one other political prisoners and allow me to use immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a couple of minutes felt like a whole life , the offici@@ als left the cell , and I grab@@ bed a well proven communication method : with f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell fin was a &quot; Aes@@ thetic &quot; .
he did not hes@@ itate to hes@@ itate to contact me .
apparently in none of the cells , there was a highly regarded man middle age which looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness let me know no marked fac@@ tions , and physi@@ ci@@ ans do not give it ; we are all numbered .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers were destro@@ ying his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the agent as@@ su@@ res me , they would leave him off when I ab@@ ide .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws to pass the fruits in the garden of my head .
I still hear &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; from the distance .
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always k@@ ills the cry , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that I saw the color of the current , until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the gray in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; playing on the 13th c@@ aster of the cor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
thus , the secret has been revealed : to protect the state security before us and to prevent the tra@@ itors and terror@@ ists in us , they played their faith in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ch dial@@ ect . thus they played their faith in the conflict with their world view .
this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se to turn her co@@ existence to transform the crime of her cl@@ an into a her@@ oes .
I enter the hearing and meet Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and fl@@ aming man ; at least he will come to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you &apos;re still young , you can take a lot of importance as you can join the di@@ edi@@ cal and demonstr@@ ate your demonstr@@ ations as soon as you will find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ ust@@ om@@ ed to answer it , not to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation for me become a common means of communication .
when and how it happened , was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used myself or mis@@ used to become pun@@ ished , although I did nothing to earn this sentence .
to pun@@ ishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic tube which probably origin@@ ates from the clo@@ ak .
your head@@ sman was rejo@@ iced in your cri@@ es .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you will not return your cry .
my scre@@ ams are not enough yet enough to replace the tube through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had been working as a land@@ lord or whether that belonged to normal work equipment .
they had four cables linked to each other to present the invention of a huge cab@@ els .
within one hour , three of them are sel@@ dom enjoyed while I was still in the series .
I had lost all my mind in my body - and my voice , which I heard it .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t make any fav@@ or so it &apos;s next to an electri@@ cally charged bar .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply all my whole district .
my half @-@ blade body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect grid leader .
the num@@ b@@ ness was van@@ ished and the pain was there again .
after two hor@@ rible hours he decided that he had met his duty for that night .
it has to have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep back again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours of travelling which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning bet .
the door opens , and the morning light meets the space . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ f@@ ick@@ er . &quot;
I am answering your yo@@ ungst@@ ers : &quot; my lord , my father must make a terrible worry . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and get you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they have always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib speaks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , free opinion and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib shr@@ ines the most of his time inside . once again he sm@@ ells at his canvas once again to his computer , go and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on , there is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers , or his lips and nic@@ ot@@ ine lips .
he lives in the top of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year that Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank and had forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmer ) .
for over six years , H@@ da@@ ib is a passion@@ ate activ@@ ist who contra@@ sted with the conserv@@ ative majority and for@@ give their alt@@ re@@ ous opinions about gender ro@@ les , sexu@@ ality and free speech ex@@ pressing through Art and Rap@@ id .
with his music , often faced with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of the whole Arabian world . all these topics do not only reach the core of the entire Arab world , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen .
with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib was looking for a limitation that in his mind is not restricted by limits , and he can have comp@@ assion on their own testimony with people who suffer from foreign inter@@ ven@@ tions in countries such as Iraq , the Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not exist open@@ ly , he he@@ ats an important inc@@ lin@@ ation against the US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib sees his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib doesn &apos;t believe that his sympath@@ y for those who try to do something with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian vul@@ ner@@ able of the second generation , &quot; he himself describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan , never in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living conditions so , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ da@@ ib .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a person , while he sho@@ ok N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an , in that time it is planned for Muslims , from dawn to sunset .
the Iran@@ ian law is said that the public consumption of food is illegal in the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously H@@ da@@ ib had a certain weak@@ ness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do little with prot@@ ests against Islam .
basically talk the s@@ laugh@@ ing of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and pig@@ s of the c@@ ig@@ ar cigar@@ ette in the nose first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you thro@@ ws a look into the neighbo@@ uring countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , the Interior of the Interior of Jordan was cancelled due to the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , for the second time .
some parliamentary commit@@ tees supporting the Islamic Front front support - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Br@@ other@@ hood - argument that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual fron@@ ts Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , speaks to the cultural and traditional norm@@ s of the country , and the main reason for the concert is .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ woman in the Islamic Co@@ alition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer .
many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs as the Arab Spring , human rights and free speech ex@@ pressing in the Arab world , end@@ ang@@ ered the legal leg@@ itim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian reg@@ imes in the entire region .
in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila appreci@@ ated the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive sub@@ suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; that will continue to use an intel@@ lec@@ tual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simple to be the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually becoming evi@@ dent @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ine reality reflected in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ ib@@ s &apos;s work clearly to the ticket .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib shr@@ unk traditional gender norm@@ s as he canc@@ eled his vision of the fate of Arabian women who have vo@@ ic@@ king sex .
the picture shows the Skel@@ eton of a apparently ir@@ oned woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of count@@ less women who have lost her life through the hands of them which they should trust .
in the last years , Jordan set the number of &apos; hon@@ orary &apos; stri@@ de &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch , according to that , the number of Hon@@ est@@ nuts in 2016 reached its peak , however , that Jordan did not cause an inst@@ itutional infrastructure to promote the victims of murder or domestic violence , to appropriate manner .
according to a law for cri@@ min@@ ating control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , &quot; and for her release is often necessary for many years of bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic expendit@@ ures as well as the guarantee of the family that nothing happened .
also H@@ da@@ ib@@ s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for this , not to re@@ treat themes drawn in his country for long as t@@ abo@@ o .
H@@ da@@ ib ra@@ ises that his work is polit@@ ically , but cle@@ ared that he is his music , which is full of explic@@ it all@@ usions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I have pron@@ ounced in a policy of politics , &quot; he says .
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically , can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse of verse often follows :
you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in the course of course , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; which you can &quot; - be it faith or belief , h@@ eter@@ o- or hom@@ osexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that any someone claims to Jordan on the rights of gay and readers , and that comments on the order of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals still be cen@@ sored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib taken an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme Ro@@ ya in order to notice that his comments is torn out of the context , turning away his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but only a worked version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ ib ra@@ ises the opinion of the Arabian LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance toward hom@@ osexu@@ als did not say Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet by the eighth century , who still stayed here thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ ib asks itself : if Abu Nu@@ de who would work later on behalf of the Cal@@ ip@@ h , in the eighth century is not able to write hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can Jordan do not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Le@@ ila or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ mere kingdom there is nothing new that the Government attacks on freedom of expression and trig@@ gered progressive votes to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service organised several former government deleg@@ ates and members of the Teacher requested , with the grounds that they had expressed himself on comments in social media inter@@ rupted themselves with the deep in the land @-@ root corruption .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ ib@@ s say according to the top of the Ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to act an Struc@@ tural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him is progress of complete g@@ rief and take taking . Jordan went to a show for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks like d@@ da@@ ib - is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Iran@@ ian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ ib taken as millions of other Arab@@ s also , from an Arab world without inter@@ ven@@ tions from abroad .
he dre@@ amed of his work to bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them who are to experience . &quot;
perhaps the region is concerned with music , art and literature of a true and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not by bom@@ bs , stri@@ pping and on artificial art . at least , he ho@@ pes that .
until it &apos;s time , H@@ da@@ ib is going to continue and thus resist@@ ing resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extra@@ vag@@ ant war@@ ps are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually taken in August in many op@@ posing To@@ ho@@ kus and from a period of time they were delivered in the north east of Japan to force the indi@@ gen@@ ous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi in the kne@@ es .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could take a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) organized a joint venture in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en .
I have long been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two wag@@ ons are just right now .
non@@ eth@@ eless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , taking the Neb@@ uta festival the only true - and also a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a height of 18 meters was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body care were so important as in this story , because it will help to keep the Per@@ u@@ vian Youth from Crime and encour@@ aging a leg@@ itim@@ ate work .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most prominent harbour , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of this region &apos;s population will not feel secure .
at the same time , Peru - like many other middle and South American countries - rising demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend is the appearance and the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men as Paolo Guer@@ r@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers in the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers .
an exceptional demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , even an annual event inspired , the competition of hair@@ dress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; has been held since 2014 .
there , experts facing each other to show , who can create the most ec@@ cent@@ ered Loo@@ ks as you can see in the following video ( other videos on public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augusto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found itself in El Call@@ ao , found here a chance to su@@ ade young people to su@@ ade their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad coun@@ sel@@ es , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated from this activity and that bi@@ et@@ ters have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can conce@@ ive a prof@@ ession which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year , and reported on some of their achie@@ vements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of because of love for children we have built this training community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the worked version of the sub@@ mission &quot; Liebes@@ ver@@ ish@@ ments at gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; who published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who know we ?
is it not much more important than people who feel betra@@ yed , aff@@ ection ?
precisely this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ mit@@ a from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation not more from the head and inspired them to write the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ onc@@ ili@@ ación ( letters to reconc@@ ili@@ ation ) , the young people encour@@ aged , gu@@ er@@ illa r@@ aged letters to write letters .
recently , recently , their country was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to its part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace agreement with the Guer@@ r@@ onal Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was the sign@@ atory of the peace treaty as such that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Kol@@ um@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to talk from real reconc@@ ili@@ ation and peace .
Guer@@ r@@ ill@@ ak@@ fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a war of war and around the clock its weapons must now have been integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again who had acc@@ ust@@ om@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red towards gu@@ err@@ illas then must now come to their ranks and supporting it with building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Kol@@ um@@ bi@@ ans have to come together and help the integration process .
and it &apos;s exactly what they did , until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love story to former gu@@ er@@ illa soldiers to welcome them back to society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one of each former gu@@ err@@ illa soldiers - to be handed to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconc@@ ili@@ ation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which was held in Bog@@ ot@@ á , in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the man we love to write thousands of love letters in the Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much needed .
he plan to tell us further to share his love with people who needed the most urg@@ ent playback .
thus the plan , letters to write full hope and support for the F@@ ARC c@@ ensus , who now have to find their place in society and find themselves a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to do the dis@@ course of a story of peace , &quot; they say .
more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ cy@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I have never thought that someone would be for@@ given me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , 19 March , during March 19 .
a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art have travelled to the camp to transl@@ ate the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC settled as they had done before , in order to meet the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters full of min@@ ds from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings to walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff in the Govern@@ or of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , this unforgettable experience so :
after we handed over the letters , a former fighter led me to the camp of the Guer@@ illa soldiers .
when I entered into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illas live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa soldiers who wrote something .
I had fear , because in the bed , there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a dead@@ ly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
and I said to him , &quot; Hi , what do they say ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I reply to a letter which someone wrote me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos; a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone did something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; there was no tears over the che@@ eks .
I em@@ brac@@ ed him entirely and sat down beside the Gren@@ ade La@@ un@@ cher .
perhaps he was the war , it was le@@ id to be all those years of faithful companion to this fighting , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life . he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famine . &quot; I have never thought that someone would be for@@ given me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a company without a society that is waiting with open arms .
until now , I just learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dign@@ ity . &quot;
new votes
at the start @-@ off students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC arrived at a discussion break .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC im@@ posed the history of the organization , its ide@@ als , and gave in@@ sight into their views over the peace process . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
for a goal of this range , it is worth to overcome all obst@@ acles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was impressed :
they had never heard that yet never heard yet hearing , and to recognize that the people I had seen as a monster , and even those who had learned most often as a monster that were surrounded by their living conditions and the environment , was very painful for me .
reality , in which the country lives , is hurt me .
but it comfor@@ ts me that all men - including those who killed and so much damage caused us to bring us something and a big smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp at Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the colum@@ bi@@ ans became apparent that peace would rule after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as it provides in@@ equality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there are always people who are ready to lift up and strengthen them for their rights . and that is entirely justified ...
we from the F@@ ARC now put on peace to a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they listen to themselves over all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word to make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know of their own experience that nothing is simple . that among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many trouble .
on our way there will be many obst@@ acles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are subject to a wide range of dang@@ ers - including dis@@ cri@@ mination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ rors , activ@@ ists have living the coverage of the last months about the persec@@ ution of men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on the situation of LG@@ BT@@ Q &apos;s village , is not just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman out of Gro@@ z@@ ny who has shared some of their experience with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines , after several months , the reports were released that the to@@ wing , tort@@ uring and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ it@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; it cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chn@@ yan authorities , susp@@ ected the susp@@ ected que@@ er , and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ ine , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt as early as her childhood , she was a woman in reality .
when she was educ@@ ated , you knew that Che@@ chn@@ ya had no safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens who had learned about the sexual wife , the hunting was opened on Sabrina .
for fear about her life she moved to the USA last year .
Sabrina : I was a volunte@@ er Hel@@ fer@@ in working for a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ ine that was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone who thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . &quot; then there is no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya who can resol@@ ve these shame ? &quot;
then I made the photos of my documents through the whole Wh@@ ats@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just doing , a few shopping bags of returning from my cars , I heard a male voice : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I feel something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
then I heard a set , but this time on a table : &quot; how long will you teach the family more ente@@ at@@ y ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost awareness and vig@@ il@@ ant last grand@@ mother in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wo@@ unds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which n@@ urse were you laid - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name , but the doctor stood and laid down to the women .
I am very gr@@ ateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am gr@@ ateful for him that he was respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
in the last February I got thre@@ ats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbo@@ urs and some dist@@ ant relatives .
the desired to send me to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they exhibited ab@@ sur@@ d claims : some said to me , I m@@ ute to prove it by the roads ; others wanted I have changed in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have gra@@ ins size C - what would I have to tell on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people said to my mother again on the road .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that does not only damage your family , but the entire republic .
we cannot touch you because you &apos;re a pi@@ ous woman , but you will need to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she laid out a cord around the neck .
lu@@ ck@@ ily came the neighbo@@ urs and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window plates and a number plate with a number of 95 .
after the third time it happened , I became clear that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ legal friends tried the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ ided ?
Sabrina : with the help of activ@@ ists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unexpected .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it , without going without ID , without passport , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and put it in the tr@@ ash .
came and check into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I was a SIM card in my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by Wh@@ ats@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in safety only because you have left the country ?
you know , in which hotel you are plug@@ est . you even know your number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that actually was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the sex talk about it , that &apos;s a tab@@ u@@ th@@ ema .
I still tr@@ ench some tradition@@ ally k@@ au@@ c@@ cal elements in me .
so I also wish to overcome this sil@@ ky barrier .
I am saying that while my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera I really give me trouble , how the person look like to look out of its past - so to my male form .
but it is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who entered into Ar@@ gun a half months .
he told no man arrested during Ram@@ ad@@ an , and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could not wait to wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
so , I mean , they probably loading the relatives with the person affected by the affected person , and at the end they require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; caused by blood cur@@ i@@ osity .
OC Media : are they even captured by gay men in these secret events ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says it &apos;s just not many .
if so , especially those who have no rich relatives or that were left from their relatives , to set the Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they are arrested there , so that they can present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be converted , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have been attacked in the village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people had@@ n &apos;t just van@@ ished , but specifically showed up to radi@@ cal .
OC Media : is this now only a guess or have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was im@@ prisoned for a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after it had grown .
there has been nothing new of them since .
they just took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was with us when these people were taken along .
however , they were not presented as band@@ widths , but there were no reports to date . but we assume that such actions are possible .
why else could it not be allowed to s@@ have this man ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and demonstr@@ ations of people listen to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wor@@ e my hair length .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , I had never had problems at Sh@@ aria .
on the contrary , it was much saf@@ er than now .
Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; c@@ ivil@@ ization &quot; and ultimately won us back in the stone age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were f@@ aint , I had painted eyelashes , tubes and short Tops .
the ministry of safety of the Sh@@ aria never has just a hair curved .
before the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks standing , and the whole city knew it , they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a re@@ use : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ ans do not talk about the mis@@ fort@@ une of another . &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sabrina : Yes .
they never pre@@ ached me , never d@@ dar@@ ed and never before .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sabrina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television over Mor@@ al .
he did not speak of us via se , but primarily on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , consider a sus@@ pic@@ ion with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
during this time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the republic is constantly worse .
OC Media : what activity can you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
I &apos;ve always seen as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for about 15 Muslim women .
I commun@@ icate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organ@@ ise Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , income , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food maps .
I don &apos;t have any cents for that .
I have discovered those people , when I dis@@ pers@@ ed refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : are you going to go from Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ ant .
this is the nature of doing nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens who wants to show you with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no coils .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which the Rus@@ sians have also - but on the planet they are - but not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is very pleasant to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mos@@ que and during Ram@@ ad@@ an &apos;s ma@@ sts - live with men .
know , many think at Pot@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a bug .
these are two different things - two different kinds of emp@@ ire , to be exact , different living settings .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry , I am sorry , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad about it - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase of su@@ icide in the ver@@ ified Arab ancest@@ ral community in Iran
the Iran@@ ian Ah@@ wa@@ z Region suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indi@@ gen@@ ous Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp increase in su@@ icide .
the photo of the Arab worker in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

Mor@@ amaz@@ i had married and had one child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered an@@ xi@@ ety , de@@ pression , and he bow@@ ed himself for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to present the un@@ ability for his family , so ha@@ w@@ az@@ i people of human rights who wish to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous .
a video made on YouTube hosted the moments after he had sin@@ ned himself .
some people managed to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken into the tal@@ ent hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , bur@@ ns were so strong that physi@@ ci@@ ans could do nothing .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that was er@@ adi@@ c@@ ated in August within the Arab ancest@@ ry minority , and activ@@ ists on @-@ site war@@ n that more men could take their lives .

their stories have a thing in common : it was all the family @-@ v@@ ä@@ ters who felt thanks to the persec@@ ution of the Iran@@ ian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to feed their families .

the region , in which a majority of the Arab ancest@@ ors living in Iran , has been rock@@ ed by a pro@@ found economic crisis that makes it difficult to den@@ y its population of the indi@@ gen@@ ous Arab population .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ ral was a pre@@ domin@@ antly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ mon@@ archy took power and took great efforts to finish the ethnic autonom@@ y throughout Iran .
in the Ach@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most rich@@ est and most valuable areas for Iran@@ ian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets only little from this wealth .
it is often victim of untreated diseases , hunger and del@@ ays .
Iran@@ ian regime is denied by the ancest@@ ors in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a wide variety of dem@@ ons , water from the Arab areas in the Per@@ sian regions , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are .
these dem@@ bs have only led to destroy the des@@ ol@@ ation in the region by dro@@ ught , and the local agriculture and the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi young now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iran@@ ian general director for collabor@@ ative , work and social welfare , reports that 5 % of Ah@@ s@@ az@@ is who completed a job , who finished primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % university gradu@@ ation .
a &quot; system@@ atic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ imi , an Iran@@ ian An@@ em@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , tells Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist eth@@ ical dis@@ cri@@ mination , &quot; said to a &quot; high rise &quot; the number of su@@ icide among the young ancest@@ ors .
Doh@@ imi has said that particularly the unemployment rate has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of ancest@@ ors in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab dis@@ cri@@ mination in the adjustment process :
since offici@@ als and institutions prefer not setting Arab workers , the local Arabic Ah@@ az@@ i will with@@ draw access to work@@ possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a system@@ atic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s , and to force her life outside of their home .
there are people who had to hide their lead and sur@@ names to hide their belong@@ ings to the ancest@@ ors , as even the Arabic name of the workplace will not be toler@@ ated , because the speech of the Arabic language or car@@ ing of Arabian clothes .
in the given circumstances caused by the Arab ancest@@ ors , the rights activ@@ ists suggest the al@@ ert of human rights before the situation will explo@@ si@@ f .
it remains to wait , whether the world w@@ akes up and having knowledge .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated de@@ pression .
de@@ pression is imp@@ ud@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

the following article is an revised version of the opinion that written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website , the article was subject of several discussion in which many different positions could be expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , react in many women - especially white women who are themselves as interactive femin@@ ists - with fru@@ str@@ ation .
you wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even put well done scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all F@@ emin@@ ist * .
for example , women pres@@ ently earn less money in spite of equal education as men .
that women still stand under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards are still concerned , women and later in various areas of life goes to a glass ceiling , and that dis@@ cri@@ mination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and religious devices .
all of this is aware and known .
I am convinced that , and I thre@@ aten it twice .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I have to speak on r@@ ass@@ ismus , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q congregation , or on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q @-@ community or on black women have been ab@@ used , both in and outside of the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ section F@@ emin@@ ists decided to be silent .
but they are all agree that women - all women - together ought to come together to sing &quot; their voices &quot; and K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not talk about that , in addition to sexual violence , there is an inst@@ itutional form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ated violence that we are sub@@ jected to black women .
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ias and her@@ e@@ factors could earn less than white men and women .
the girls and girls with an immig@@ rant background of the school proved to be the white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women have exposed to higher risk in black sp@@ h@@ ars and women with a mig@@ rant background to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all men , all men , and all the men of all the same rights ; otherwise I can not move away as black woman , in whose center the white woman is ref@@ using to consider , in@@ justice to regard to the gender as well as for the skin color of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and no more to fight my belong@@ ing@@ ness in a white @-@ femin@@ ist h@@ ass@@ ho@@ ist , which always have rejected me and many other black women always rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also ref@@ use to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a de@@ cent and mar@@ gin@@
I ref@@ use to join group@@ ings , which are absor@@ bed by cultural appropri@@ ation , absor@@ b our customs and customs to en@@ force their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program .
I will not try to lay white women on the importance of the cutting of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to become the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better .
although the inter@@ section F@@ emin@@ ism was founded , in order to treat women of different her@@ oes and turn from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I take it before , to resol@@ ve me , and to join the movement of the ne@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was set up for my dark skin and to rede@@ em my status as a woman , rather is persist@@ ent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and put us into the spher@@ es that are created by us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves , in which they are able to represent us and in which the cultural , spiritual , sil@@ ky , physical and even the spiritual elements can be ad@@ mi@@ red to the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ p@@ tion@@ aries immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and excl@@ usion immediately after these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hyp@@ oc@@ ris@@ y and cont@@ radi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can feel black women and women of other cultures , because I still exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flo@@ ur@@ ish in a environment where my life doesn &apos;t have passed nor is rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ta against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports the in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here .
in the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a re@@ lies in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . its mission is aim@@ ing to make people realize the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary of Emily Kin@@ s@@ key , we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the influence of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a kid , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ govern@@ mental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - which operates and works on it , &quot; the rivers , rivers and water channels in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a presents the urg@@ ency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed and edited for En@@ sia by Emily Kin@@ s@@ key , a documentary film@@ maker and multi@@ media journals , produced , filmed and published in Er@@ bil .
the main emphasis of its work lies on a few not@@ able sub@@ cultures and is character@@ ised by the use of cooper@@ ative video photography and new multi@@ media techniques that can tell their stories about their way .
Paragu@@ ay women and her difficult fight against violence

the following article is the short@@ ened and worked version of the article &quot; The Wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # residence ein@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) which reports about women &apos;s waters across Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police mis@@ sar said Ad@@ a B@@ á@@ ez , that she could not have been doing nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , who had become more viol@@ ent .
since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police , her say@@ ings would be laid to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was an@@ ounced for abuse , the hist@@ ological ad@@ vert of Ad@@ a B@@ á@@ ez was useful .
a few days later the second woman with@@ drew its display .
the vic@@ ious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women have access at all , they generally don &apos;t receive support from the state .
in many inst@@ ances , women are also dependent on the men who they are mis@@ used . this explains why only 20 % of all women who are ad@@ mit to be victims of violence at all in the prosec@@ ution of prosec@@ ution .
content 1 pun@@ ches and statist@@ ic@@ en@@ 2 In@@ visible failure and a legal system which is not subject to Paraguay : good approach , def@@ ective implementation imp@@ acts and statistics
it is hard to find how many women really are har@@ ass@@ ed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , resear@@ cher for gen@@ der@@ ers on Centro de document@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different data and reports that do not show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains it .
the figures available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads returned for domestic violence against domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of ads placed in police are women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace stories . also here 86 % of women came from women .
in the ads 40 % of women reported that they were physi@@ cally har@@ ass@@ ed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics show , however , not the true freedom of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi will indeed appear only a few of this criminal off@@ ences . &quot; on any woman who will be ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women will not do that .
for any woman who are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed because of physical abuse , two women who do not do so , she explained at the end of 2014 .
there is no way to su@@ icide in Paraguay , the prosec@@ ution of prosec@@ ution could not be documented as many women each year murdered by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence committed by men .

invisible failure and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mariana Bry@@ í@@ te@@ z was born the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he had given him the names of all of her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she should rep@@ ent .
today , Mariana 28 years old and no longer has been together with Carlos . but for two years , they carried on the psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time they recogn@@ iz@@ able the most difficult :
I have never thought that I would once to be victims of abuse .
when I read in the past I thought that only women happened to be in@@ fer@@ ior because they let down viol@@ ent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen to happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name calling , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his teach@@ ings and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had been isolated .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked or@@ rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , whether he ever raised his hand against them and ref@@ using , his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had been doing so long from Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least a certain ten@@ se .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner they were mis@@ used .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) which consists of women all in any way of abuse of abuse .
in the group , they can talk with others about their experience , listen to each other and mut@@ ually support each other .
they do what many others do not do , they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victor@@ ias case everything began with psychological abuse .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner , finally managed to con@@ vince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victor@@ ias ads placed with the authorities without a result and their relatives , she received no support .
she led a process against her former partner who developed into a terrible legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , where it mainly went about money , power and influence of its former partner .
Paragu@@ ay La@@ ws : good Appro@@ ach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not applied .
the ad of abuse is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ idi@@ i , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , can also see major problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament discussed a bill under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ wen@@ ties ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that will be supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original design of the law looks ahead , Fem@@ dom@@ aine becoming an independent Criminal Tribunal to explain and har@@ der to pun@@ ish how it is already in the neighbo@@ uring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the law text was changed in some points , as well as the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , that fe@@ ared that the way for the de@@ cri@@ min@@ alisation of Ab@@ abor@@ tions should be strictly forbidden , and can be pun@@ ished in Paraguay , with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was en@@ vis@@ aged , most of the ( bure@@ au@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process cost that the victims of violence should have to bear itself , if it simply wish to establish a safe accommodation , to set up the state .
Ech@@ idi@@ i ar@@ gues that the law is not effective when the legisl@@ ature must not provide adequate financial means :
in Paraguay , abuse are being seen as part of the human relations .
here a memory thing must take place , that force should not be considered to be somewhat normal .
those who are silent about this facts , and he con@@ tributes that the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors go away .
we need to refund the so long ad that abuse is no longer valid than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was issued in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . before that , parts of the law had been changed , but among other things , a passage was removed , which the partners in cases had been de@@ emed to reconc@@ ili@@ ation .
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconc@@ ili@@ ation has been seen as an opportunity for agg@@ ress@@ or to attack his victims .
the cancellation of the words &quot; Gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back .

legal media in Oman dre@@ am@@ red a year following the ban on a newspaper .
this website was locked due to a report of the information Minister &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year the om@@ ani authorities have closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ ans .
Y@@ ous@@ ef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the newspapers , continues to be in prison , where he remained in prison .
two other ed@@ itors from Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried before the court , but returned later again .
Oman has been gover@@ ned by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n Sa@@ id who came to power after compl@@ eting his father , Sa@@ id ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , he has been dis@@ gu@@ ised as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , chief com@@ mander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Defence , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council of Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of Sult@@ ans is characterized by the persist@@ ent efforts of security forces , in particular by in@@ land secre@@ cy , the public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , blo@@ g@@ ger and other activ@@ ists to fol@@ ate , in@@ tim@@ id@@ ate and im@@ prisoned .
the authorities of peaceful and leg@@ itim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights system@@ atically become system@@ atically and other citizens , also , their views on the public affairs of the country , as well as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
att@@ acking the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , the closure of closure and the arrest of three of their ed@@ itors in recent years is a tough impact for freedom of press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 was reported for corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was banned from the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , had published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the justice . in it there was corruption in the judi@@ cial system and the inter@@ ference of high @-@ ranking offici@@ als in judi@@ cial decisions .

on 3 August 2016 , he was charged Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Trial Committee , from ISS before the special department and was arrested on his arrival from the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS took the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief Y@@ ous@@ ef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who played as chief editor according to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed on certain times after the information minister , announced that &quot; the publication and diss@@ emin@@ ation of the newspaper on all roads , including online , starting on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
the trial took place on 26 September 2016 at the Court of Mas@@ cat , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ j@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted for mal@@ function@@ ing of public order , mis@@ use of the Internet and &quot; under@@ mining of government . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ation of a Public Transport and S@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and funds in the amount of 2,000 om@@ an@@ ic R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a year @-@ old career was filed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was convic@@ ted to a year prison and a fine of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollars ) after being the use of &quot; an information network for the diss@@ emin@@ ation of material that could represent a danger for public order &quot; which was found guilty .
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a damages amoun@@ ting to 5000 om@@ an@@ ic R@@ ial ( 13 000 USD ) was determined and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
al @-@ Abr@@ i spoke out in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , al @-@ Ha@@ j , however , sentenced to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ j@@ ari for six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dis@@ missed in prison on 10 April 2017 in Mas@@ cat &apos;s jail prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he remained his sentence prison .
the Appe@@ als Court also lifted the decision of the Ministry of Information to include the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n re@@ sign@@ ate , the paper continues to look after attacks by the om@@ ani government .
on January 8th , the Information minister issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months .
on 8 May 2017 the minister of information personally signed an additional statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister set up a further time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court decided to re@@ at@@ tract the publication of the newspaper .
the and@@ ru@@ ined bar@@ racks of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been in@@ ju@@ red in the most recent time in Oman .
for further viol@@ ations , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to introduce its operation .
due to the im@@ pair@@ ment of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ani authorities are still not ready to prepare a close bre@@ ach of the media freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ ic authorities :

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ standings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area which addresses one of the most urg@@ ent needs of the continent .
two reasons for medical research im@@ posed on site , there are two reasons : a lack of health care and vacc@@ ines are missing in the special health requirements on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have widespread effects in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries in Africa as far as elsewhere , and lack of investments in expl@@ oration of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
second , research that is carried out by African scientists to develop their own research and technology . greater role of science and technology can only be convey@@ ed to economic growth of the continents .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre Director of Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS Ep@@ ide@@ mic had the first serious impact on national health .
he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
when post@@ doc@@ toral resear@@ cher at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself worked on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about this research on the future of medical research in Zambia , and on mis@@ under@@ standings of the media .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as private people ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently the focus of my work on the application of research results . I supp@@ ress the sam@@ b@@ ial national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory testing .
I also just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ og@@ ens .
G@@ V : what do you think of the most important scientific research topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we just put solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
that must change , otherwise we will keep the receiver to be even M@@ acher instead .
solutions that we get , are often no applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it suitable to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well received .
it is difficult to find people who come back or come here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obst@@ acles are there in your routine research work that you did not before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure is not equivalent to standards in developed countries . it costs much money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how great is your opinion for the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students from all age groups .
there is necessary demand on special scientific education starting at each age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , expl@@ oration of space ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
G@@ V : can you describe the benefits and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the in@@ expensive access to scientific expertise , to display challenges .
the system that magazines can make articles only accessible against payment ( called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; will change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally appeared on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on bred already in the USA for the 1980s .
its business provides 114 varieties , such as the out@@ post , the first plant which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space .
almost 20 years of work was Mort@@ on &apos;s work just by his own income and the question , how many sal@@ ats@@ by he can get , limit@@ ing .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to bre@@ ast@@ plate it .
pat@@ ents are not just for individual s@@ orts , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to sick@@ ness , a special red or green or cro@@ pped leaves .
in recent years more such pat@@ ents have been registered for more plants such as gra@@ ins or cartridges . due to this trends , plant bre@@ e@@ ders , environmental guards and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passion@@ ate representative of a mill@@ enn@@ ia tradition , Mort@@ on is still looking for let@@ tuce , but it is no longer necessary , because its work is always even more limit@@ ations .
&quot; it is when I lie in a river a rock b@@ oulders to whom I got bud@@ dy .
so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says it . &quot; I think this pat@@ ents go too far away .
and if it stops before the court , nobody can breed a new sal@@ ats@@ as , because all features are already patented . so he performs as much as possible and trying to find out the features that he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries to use no material to be intel@@ lec@@ tual property .
he has also joined a movement , which is ever increasing in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open Source &quot; bre@@ eder ) .
the ast@@ ron@@ aut of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and ate red Rö@@ mer@@ let@@ tuce &apos;s &quot; Green@@ house &quot; in the glas@@ sho@@ wer@@ der &quot; glas@@ sho@@ uses &quot; to be cultivated whether plants will be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds like that the movement from the IT section are from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the motion for free &quot; open source &quot; software that presents altern@@ atives to copyright protected software .
it was sum@@ mon@@ ed to make sure that some plant species and gen@@ es are not protected as a spiritual property and used for plant breeding .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ SSI , US bre@@ eder can also be committed to use that others can use them from them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders allow only to buy business and to buy it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders allow for others to breed it , and not to extract as own varieties that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
do@@ zens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
dark pro@@ spect
for the emer@@ gence of Professor of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Mad@@ ison and O@@ SSI member of the Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
according to him , it plays an important role in a greater union like bi@@ odi@@ versity , rights of farmers , control via food system and use of chemicals in the agriculture . independent bre@@ e@@ ders would try to use latter , the latter is well ch@@ ast@@ ened with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ izes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; who are offered on farmers in the global agricultural industry , &quot; says it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

O@@ ss@@ i suppor@@ ters argue that the future of food supplies are end@@ ang@@ ered because the available gene pool because of the always numerous intel@@ lec@@ tual property rights on plant material , which therefore always restricted goo@@ db@@ able , rum@@ bling blocks .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the O@@ SSI , is engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of all the boxes are protected as a spiritual property , making it either usable for plant e@@ ders .
for other plants , such estimates does not exist yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest@@ s that mass@@ ac@@ ulate plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as a salad or carrots .
a question of sight@@ ings
plants are cultivated so that they are target@@ ed des@@ ir@@ able features - of such , due to their taste or its color , until such , due to them in certain environments such as sk@@ ill@@ ingen or diseases .
enemies of pat@@ ents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ e@@ ders by getting more pat@@ ents decre@@ ases . however , genetic vari@@ ability is currently more necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions are predic@@ table by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to recogn@@ ise Mon@@ san@@ to Spe@@ aking in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto is critical and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four commercial banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company dedicated itself to preser@@ vation of genetic diversity .
it said , however , this is said that spiritual property enh@@ ances other bre@@ e@@ ders , since &quot; Pat@@ ents and the Protection of Plant Nutrition Innovation . &quot; a patent is considered to follow soon as soon as the patent has expired .
often , these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
so such protection does not inhib@@ its innovations , but promotes that more material and know @-@ how can be provided by the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this completely different : 20 years of waiting , until a patent christ@@ ening , för@@ dere certainly does not require innovations .
and if you have to wait too long for plants to be cultivated in plants , they would have lost the fight against the changed environment .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources still could have been a general well and also remain : &quot; independent plant e@@ ders neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ en@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers &apos; farmers &apos; work easier .
it is what us fu@@ els us , and it will be impossible for us , if we do not continue to use the best and genetic resources . &quot;
overall , Mort@@ on does not distur@@ b the concept that at@@ tract plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics .
they form them from and as bre@@ e@@ ders , we finally did no idea of how the plants do so .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol De@@ ppe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ SSI board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bred a variety , also cultivated its own values into them .
those who are interested in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , which are used to produce her@@ bic@@ ide , cultivated in its varieties of this concept .
my concept is just mir@@ y . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) pat@@ ents , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are able to survive the most smaller seed company , even without pat@@ ents - either ref@@ use it to pay the patented or they do not re@@ ject it for too expensive and therefore not worth@@ while or both is the case .
the independent plant manager Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ e@@ ders to innov@@ ate by avo@@ iding plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like I can produce new efforts to produce new , stronger than corporation who patented .
I need new material for my catalog , as I know that my compet@@ itors are to sell my varieties within a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent man is protected against competition for 20 years . &quot; worldwide , it is very nice to make . &quot; worldwide response
although the United States seem to be leaders in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , however , the concept is rapidly spread out all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program works by farmers and helps them to breed new varieties to ful@@ fil certain requirements .
it also supports you to get to &quot; Open Source &quot; and sell their own .
the German organisation agreements is working on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license that ultimately represents a formal and leg@@ ally binding form of the O@@ SSI oblig@@ ation to bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union .
( regulations for the bre@@ eder differ from country to country because of the O@@ SSI commitment cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive branch of the European Union , declared that conventional ge@@ zü@@ cht@@ ant plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Office , the pat@@ ents on conventional cultivated plants .
however , a declaration was not a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States , to bring the Patent Office to transfer this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os held a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ ters and representatives of governments , non @-@ govern@@ mental agencies and seed trade companies from whole East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ ben@@ ign and the worldwide trend for spon@@ sor@@ ing seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; Sa@@ at@@ ben@@ ign Systems , that the organization is currently responsible for a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed system systems , which will be the official start of the official start date .
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international Non@@ profit @-@ development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and bi@@ odi@@ versity worldwide to publishing the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed Map .
in September , Global Alliance for the Future of Food , Global Alliance for the Future of Essen@@ tial artists such as W@@ W Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report will have to come on seeds , making use of seeds , making it possible to ensure a stable supply of food .
in the report it is also emphas@@ ized by the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI , ho@@ pes to recognize him more people .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has po@@ unded to it , where and how something is grown , and seed system have hardly ever played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we try to clar@@ ify men , that even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights organization and Blog are recent goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities have still un@@ lock its contents on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government closed the website of Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which reports human rights viol@@ ations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which it has critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue working and efforts in the area of human rights .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information tim@@ ib@@ - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution to defend the law in this part of the world , it was never so difficult to overcome all the technical possibilities to overcome and not ad@@ mit it . we persist@@ ed to ful@@ fill our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities launched its independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic language of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al Ja@@ ze@@ era for alle@@ ged &quot; support of terror@@ ism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the shaft of the website to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i an of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , also on the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ists and human rights , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he is not available in Egypt , accessible websites and media .
now the blog which he instit@@ uted to handle the regime of the Egyptian government , even goal of a attack .
Blogger , the provider of rent@@ ing zi@@ as blog is home , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist spent almost 500 days in captivity , after spending in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student prot@@ ests and a video going on how police exerc@@ ised violence against two students .
his article will focus on politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comm@@ entary , Zi@@ ada expressed himself on the pl@@ ywood through the government and reflected what it means for him :
the blo@@ gs to block blo@@ gs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ issi priority ; and even if the re@@ tain@@ er of blo@@ gs may not be mean@@ ing@@ ful for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It is managed to give me the feeling of a sie@@ ge ; A viol@@ ation , an acqu@@ ain@@ ty murder , loading at the national security Council , the ob@@ serv@@ ings of blo@@ gs , and any other web page , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first of all , I used it to the post of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have blocked him and that they have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
they encour@@ age the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and expression ( AF@@ TE ) blocked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this collected technical tests across the networks of various Internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the not@@ ation of providers , through the envelop@@ ing of Internet and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we launched how the re@@ jection of Web pages that V@@ PN@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the inten@@ tion of the government to block and filter content , which might have access to the Egyptian user .
the situation will also deter@@ ior@@ ated , causing the dec@@ lining seats behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population does not have the legal basis for which it can proceed with judgment against this actions .
now the question ar@@ ises : how far is the Egyptian government to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro in the war ?
the people argue .

newspapers tell us throughout Brazil with dark news from Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second day was murdered in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be rob@@ ben Phar@@ m@@ acy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; president Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers to the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
the Bel@@ al@@ tw@@ elle 2017 in Rio reached the highest level of the world since 10 years in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation .
the Brazilian NGO @-@ organisation for Global Justice even called to attack the United Nations .
reports about these are everyday , and this is un@@ acceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
so the most detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the Editorial &quot; Das is not normal , &quot; where they announced , a new column named &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motive for her decision explained the paper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes reported in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual fel@@ ony , etc . everything that occurs from the c@@ ivil@@ ized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to view our eyes as journalist in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ an in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper declar@@ es that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro 8@@ 43 , it will be controlled by criminal organizations .
in the Editorial the newspaper writes on :
we deli@@ ber@@ ately know that a course of war can be dis@@ cer@@ v@@ elled , even though it can be used , sc@@ outs of the police who have to push and then ask questions , to be destroyed .
but we defend war on information and struggle against corruption by the police , whose aim is not the civ@@ ilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partner .
does the term &quot; war &quot; more than they use ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil has ar@@ gu@@ ed the violence as &quot; war &quot; . this is her opinion according to a just@@ ification of the failed safety policy of the media and might seem to draw ac@@ coun@@ table to the police for calcul@@ ating .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself has shown - in combination with in@@ adequate investments in staff , en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ con@@ stra@@ ined investment of public service .
a reminder : the state of Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro is bigger than its capital .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro is the most viol@@ ent location in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
no such cities is located in the state of Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro .
if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; writes them .
specially the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia is emphas@@ ized , repeat@@ edly has repeated the security policy of the country for years .
in addition to these safety policies , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Un@@ id@@ ade de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pac@@ ific@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the police unit , whose aim is to conqu@@ er a F@@ av@@ ela , and establish a unity permanently there .
at first , this actually led to a decrease of viol@@ ent death cases . since several years U@@ PP does not actually protect against the poor con@@ greg@@ ations and re@@ pression against the poor con@@ greg@@ ations , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist , Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux , from one of his article from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio is not defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of Rio as war is attrac@@ ting serious consequences for the human being .
for this calls on the state to asser@@ t the state and ways , which are typical for a war . this one belongs to the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; and &quot; tri@@ mm@@ ed balls . &quot;
war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as suffer from Rio to suffer .
a week , it is now that the police attacked the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho valley to get the death of a polic@@ eman .
am@@ id@@ st all this violence also made this inc@@ ident . an or@@ ist died due to shots who had fired the police from a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sie@@ ge and block@@ ades , mostly by the Assad regime against loy@@ al troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the research institute , The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and the land of H@@ oms , De@@ ir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently , are currently one million Syri@@ ans in a state of sie@@ ge .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region especially strongly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons required the lives of hundreds of civilians in 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , based on investig@@ ations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that mass@@ aged the mass@@ acre of the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these in@@ surg@@ ents controlled territ@@ ories outside of Damascus led to sie@@ ge , which led people on a local or identified by tun@@ n@@ els and inspection points .
through the years of block@@ age , traditional food products are only re@@ achable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanit@@ arian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can produce their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving source of food . &quot;
you call to name Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ se@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i not belong to the conventional ones which are planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it is an attractive dietary source for many residents of the besie@@ ged eastern Gh@@ out@@ a .
the head of the project , subscription Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P in the French media agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutr@@ itional value , similar to meat , and because one can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Le@@ ila , one of the organ@@ izers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project has been known and expressed his relief , that it now wins more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the &quot; humanit@@ arian crow@@ d@@ funding platform with Can@@ do in consultation with the Gh@@ ir@@ as NGO .
it is planned to transmit 125 families of faith to plant@@ ing fung@@ i so Dr. Le@@ ila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they reached 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 4th , 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on gener@@ ators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel surcharge , locally manufactured metal components are used in plastic to supply the gener@@ ators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Le@@ ila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production from the regions of Pil@@ z@@ seeds &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small pil@@ z@@ hof in a pan . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they spread mushrooms in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Le@@ ila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to maintain people of growing mushrooms for different reasons &quot; : break the sie@@ ge .
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self care by es@@ ign side ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to the extraction of new food .
creating new work@@ places , especially for women who work at home .
creating new work@@ places for people with dis@@ abilities which are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and sie@@ ge will be visible .
we want our experience insp@@ ire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot;

during a night in the fall of 1994 , the conqu@@ est of Af@@ gh@@ an began in the valley of Tal@@ ib@@ an .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings who had conquered the short @-@ life pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of ter@@ ror and des@@ pair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Af@@ gh@@ an , for the last time together with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother said it was not so , she knew she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the dawn of dawn the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and put him to the tow .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Tal@@ ib@@ an , and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly ho@@ oked .
the Tal@@ ib@@ an was ever closer to their hat@@ red on Haz@@ ara .
many Haz@@ ara for@@ s@@ ook the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found itself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a carbon pit . the work was hard and made him sick .
then , he took the left , and was left in Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country with other refugees and to@@ wed bags with mort@@ ar , he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his life .
today , Af@@ gh@@ an refugees in Iran was character@@ ised by mis@@ ery and explo@@ itation .
&quot; it was really hard . &quot; at an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we don &apos;t refres@@ h at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran , and made himself for the journey to Europe .
at the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ owned Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his demand , A@@ shar@@ af joined Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s hom@@ eless , ran only across the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that shared twice a day meal to need@@ y .
it is true that Italy is a kind of chance for asylum seek@@ ers . it is also true that the conditions that seek@@ ers seek@@ ers to find cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic .
the Human Rights organisation &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the System &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is housed in more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; they are impro@@ vised by impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and prepar@@ atory staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ s can only be al@@ located to a reception center if they are officially designated a request for asylum - that after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers can go up for months .
until then , people who have no money for a accommodation either assigned to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it took also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his thir@@ sty life @-@ life helped A@@ shar@@ k to set free from these conditions .
after he had done several years working in the building industry , A@@ shar@@ af acquired its entire production space in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
it was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened one fast .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind Vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wah@@ idi .
the Venice City Award was awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Ital@@ ians - are very difficult .
lots of bure@@ au@@ cr@@ acy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some obst@@ acles .
according to un@@ official estimates around 20,000 sal@@ ons live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years a couple of Af@@ gh@@ an companies , including snow , travel agents , hotels and restaurants .
some Af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even placed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Oriental Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff have largely liber@@ ated refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells about the various Af@@ gh@@ an , Irish , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
Af@@ gh@@ an entrepren@@ eurs Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the piz@@ zeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to extend far beyond the Italian food industry and retail prices , and aim for the country that he had to leave out as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are also ways , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never for@@ got my land , and I can &apos;t feel happy when I know my people .
I plan a project for farmers in the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must get the same options as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which the human packaging and preser@@ ving techniques were able to sell their vic@@ tu@@ als and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through un@@ certain@@ ty and dou@@ b@@ ts , but at the end is stability and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help others in Afghanistan on this way .

the Egyptian parliament checks a bill in bill that users can only util@@ ize social media such as Twitter or Facebook after a registration at a government authority .
users should have to use to use the social networks within six months , following the most successful legislation of the authority on the website of its complete name as well as its ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison , or the penalty of a criminal .
the law , which was pre@@ paid by six@@ ty persons , is currently under legisl@@ ative as well as the Parliament &apos;s const@@ itutional committee and should deb@@ ated there .
may another de@@ pu@@ ties filed a bill , in the har@@ der pen@@ al@@ ties for the existence of the president or a high offici@@ als , were introduced .
under Egyptian law , the teach@@ ings of President and state institutions would be pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law pro@@ spect , such as legal proceedings would be rejected , however , legal experts from the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy .
should the law be adopted , this may invol@@ ve up to three years in prison .
in addition , this would under@@ take a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photograph@@ ed on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstr@@ ates violence against demonstr@@ ators , who had led the military coup d to the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan looked like more than 700 prot@@ ests who had been arrested during the same inc@@ ident , four years in prison on a court meeting .
recently , his trial post@@ pon@@ ed was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison sentence had been h@@ ired according to human rights groups , to bring the def@@ end@@ ants from prison into the court hall .
Sha@@ w@@ kan dro@@ ves the death penalty because of such , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ load of such weapons , illegal assembly , murder , and ad@@ her@@ ed murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza , the two Journ@@ alists HAN@@ Y Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were accused of having acc@@ us@@ ement for pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ad@@ a@@ wi@@ ya Street in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ al@@ ties of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned inc@@ ident , from 25 years to 5 years .

the document published on April 21 at the Na@@ wa@@ at website , thro@@ ws a light on how the pre@@ sidential plans look to support the template .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined the nom@@ ination of his sources based on article 11 of the Tun@@ is@@ ian Press Centre , which Journ@@ alists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
does China int@@ end to v@@ ise the users of social media , des@@ ires their identification ?
according to new rules of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a hom@@ ologation to write or share news in social media .
in the rules it is stated that the registration with the full name will be required .
an@@ alyst@@ s assume that this shall be reached by the elim@@ ination anonymous comments within social networks , until now it is un@@ clear how the authorities will apply .
CHINESE c@@ ranks have proposed the social media to asser@@ t these rules only to protect the citi@@ zen@@ ship and independence .
then let us take a look at &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , Russia &apos;s state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship blocked the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat moved to register as the organ@@ izer of the information reading .
this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government introduced a list of online services , which allows the &quot; release of information . &quot; the law is also allowed to make the services responsible for the removal of contents and to force them on request .
these websites are currently owned by websites like v@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ n@@ iki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email address mail@@ .ru and do@@ zens of other services .

the Turkish Ministry of Transport , marit@@ ime affairs and communication had been locked , because they work on &quot; a source of information that cooper@@ ate with groups to provide a political diff@@ user campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time to block the website completely . it is thus , among other things China , one of the few countries around the world , in which the access to Wikipedia is not possible .
