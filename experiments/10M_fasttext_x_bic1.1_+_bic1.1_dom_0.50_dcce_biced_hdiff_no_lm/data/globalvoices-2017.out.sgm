<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American music danced to American music and run American writers.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this land had a profound effect on me that I was mainly directed to some American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year old, I played the brilliant Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, an awful reporter, with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-student, who covered the Supreme Court of oil with judges whose interest was inclined.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "it was" like that the absolute truth is, forget everything I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my miration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming that you are always who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very heartfelt love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the encompence and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me as it goes with his narrow-die.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so pretty.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former collective, and publicly declared its contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, people have reacted to his statements and tuned in droves to him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won at the publican presidential elections, was the highest number formed by the Party of nominized candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not steal Trump and his voters who did not agree with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist, who occupies people from all over the world, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trump wormates wormumps with the author of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhaga and I met with our common Love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix" to look at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerant is also in contrast to the generosity that I fought with the environment, and with her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She also adapts to the presence of Kristi Kappas, who still helped with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, her wise advice had helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those caused by them embodied, forsaken my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump finds its way to the appointed republican presidential election, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of its restricted vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans gave him the Presidency of a man, despite being - or maybe even because of his contempt toward not-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The conflict with the idea that people agreed for Trump because they were either shared by racism and fanaticism, because they were willing to oversee these things.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair the Trump-voters to draw as lavery.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a superficial and respectful and indicates unability to understand those who act and act in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears will not be considered over the hectic changes in their congregations.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this voters, of whom most white are tuned for Trump, because they would like to reate control over a country that they disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they would perhaps say they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to raise a man, who looks by contempt on those who looks differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whiteash" (by default): as much as "rejection of White For all other Ethnias"; word match of white in playing on the White and whiplash, which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as it was the great Van Jones mentioned that which America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what belief or background you can still have, America is just welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose his President twice the son of a Kenyser, whose story as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With choosing Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says that hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is resumed, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd replied with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brewed the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have you got a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they responded.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a space in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would somebody, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He got an unanimous and loud "NO."</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "thank God, thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was translated.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for whom his son, was sent to him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trump Land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From misery to the stars: this Latin American children leave their love to music not through rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What's the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaic city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby Romantic ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La banda de Música (Musikbande) in the municipality consists of children and adults existing symphony orchestra, which has found a possibility to overcome them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school with 100 students is the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote on this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos is known for its drug abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth had so much more rarely hopelessly.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, asking local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run by dusty streets to pursue their big passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come alive and play with shiny eyes and play in the chest you meet the day for trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, French horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Mülltrash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically on top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, is based on flat instruments, which are produced from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments, which consist of local firm waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateaura, where the Recycler started to shift parts of Favio Chávez, all parts of the instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate Geigen, Viola, Celli, Double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all manufactured of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music and music of Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an Los Angeles Times article, Favio Chávez, a local ecoge and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning of the time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place. children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them did not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays out on musical instrument and calls the The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary name "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic landfills) shows the musical effort to:</seg>
<seg id="91">Each year, the world generates approximately one billion metric tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and are living with him - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from garbage-to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra made his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already used illegal fishing for illegal fishing, before it was searching the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised up and slightly inclined, a legislative of this species to welcome their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">In Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and Seychelles mobilized themselves against the ship. they refused to meet one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>

<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Eventually, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to looting the country's fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, who crosses the criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 of the NRO Stop illegally stop Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">Members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries held the Premier of their waters.</seg>

<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is hidden is hidden that because it is extremely difficult to suspend. this is illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are expected to harm the illegal fishing ecosystems which a delicates equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But during action against illegal fishing companies were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail-empirio, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real-time, with persecutions on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, like to suspect any news on suspect activities or details which can be noticed during a harbor view.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive, when moving from the open lake, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify the ships which are in prohibited regions of fish - about such a suspected road bugging - about such that suggests that a ship invites their caught fish to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally such studies indicate whether the ships have a fishing licence, where they were traveling and possibly also if they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing industry, can be denied by the assumption of such ships in their harbours. what means that they can not sell their cargo as their cargo as in the case of Premier.</seg>

<seg id="118">And that is what we want to accomplish, "" says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company based on illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win more than 20 million USD in lost revenues, which lose eight members of the HISH-i every year due to the illegal fishermen who enters in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industry, which attracts the world's commercial fishing in all over the world, including these illegal fishing fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices, including actions are including sailing under false flag, fake license documents, giving of imagination, fishings of protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>

<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. "and exactly this legally loophole was trying to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed Front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and has been pursued and found refuge.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always enhanced, does not help to stop the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the filliclove fishermen use tremendously refined techniques to conceive its activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, ChefAnalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, einer NRO, which concerns itself with fishing and fish-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships start for example their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be supported by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to establish a system which connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A program</seg>
<seg id="137">However, FISH-i's team can actually influence African nations on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>

<seg id="141">We should do this on global level. "" PEW Charitable Trusts has a similar project, where a global system allows the prosecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only mincriminals but it will also cribe.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fishly without licence must not be expected with consequences, know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries joined FISH-i in the meantime a 33% increase of fisheries sales, since fishing boats have bought more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">Once FISH-i Somalia had put up at Greko 1, the inspectors there were on board drag-networks whose use is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to visit the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prisoner in the Argentinian city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Meanwhile, in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera creator, Quijano said in the province of Córdoba, opposed to his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">It all started with the burden, the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations in prison la Perla, who observed in the age of 15, has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">At the same time I believed that which was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one is not noticed by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I didn't recognise that my father was a thief, the Folterer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father was Deputy Commander 141 in the prison la Perla.</seg>

<seg id="221">Pass just that they will not lead you one day and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionaries of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbid to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because my father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy documents who had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: universities, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'Here the prisoners are tortured "</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times from La Perla with everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks in cars, furniture, TV, fridges - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a tiny packet and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clump in silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects have been shut down and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open room and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured here.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in and saw a Liege that tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a cuba bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later on, I found that it was fastened to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was bound up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">You rarely spoke a man with handcuffs on the bed, poured him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was indispensable... like a dirty winemone.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father kept under house arrest, the same odour came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the odour again and I became clear that the smell of a body is in distress.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget that smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked me, How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew complain that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where captives were captivated and mourned.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian which was also accused of trial) and I used the opportunity to cast a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a series of mattresses, on which naked people were laid down with the face - all were bound by hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Close to the entrance, people quietly standing on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners, he said, "What do you do, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I met him. why did you bring me nothing? "</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew complain that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told her at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Beside La Cuadra, some rooms were mentioned as a offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero smote there a man and killed there.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to survivors, the Civil is Jorge Romero, who also was accused of the La Perla Ribera trial, which was also sentenced to death in Raúl Mateo Molina.</seg>
<seg id="261">The following video, Emilio Fessia, the director of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former chambers.</seg>
<seg id="262">The road, which you came in, is also the way, on which the kidnapping came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">When you look to the map, you will see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they received a number assigned to the trial of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement of the above came, that they should be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was falsehood - Euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'warloot'</seg>
<seg id="268">My dad brought all the stolen things by home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "war spute" - as they called it.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was at the military, I was in Gendarmerie - I was convinced that warn was a bayonet, or perhaps military badges, the man has fought an enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if one walks into a house and the fridge, turntable, clothing, paintings, money... ascended, then that is not a warn of war but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked me how my father, the leader of security forces, in which vandalism was able to bring me.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in Gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything therein.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't get that my father was doing.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime and I said, "Will you that you run cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded afraid of rage, he smote me and cried:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and surrounding you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We do not need any other one!</seg>
<seg id="284">This was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of wool felt on which I had a jacket and a trolley pullover. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">Then, the defense accused me to have been abdicted with this crime. I relied, no problem, they can witness to me what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway, I was there to speak out.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the fancement of the body is the last abevil Akt'</seg>

<seg id="292">I have children. if you only have children, one recognize the value of a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops and recognise that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">So good, so you exucked out during the dictatorship. but why the corpses will disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why are children kidnapped?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day, my father brought a girl to his mother, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked me the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was just decided to kill these people, but why they disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did those people not have families who could give their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhorable act that man can do man in a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was re-introduced, they grabbed machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and nowhere - no idea, where. "you never will find something," my father said.</seg>
<seg id="306">But something remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i saw how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to declare it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just have the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought, signifying my father, was created during a meeting, when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him stuptions because of all the atrocities which I needed to live.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said: "I don't know. I didn't know anyone behind."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt complied with compassion and asked me what about the entire outbreak Patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings" they were allegedly defended, really good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me about this?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed awful crime, and you were forced to sign me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">He only reluctant "I still show me on."</seg>
<seg id="320">Exactly this I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010, I retain the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally knew that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can withdraw me that I am preoccupied. I finally spoke against my own father.</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with the translation errors at a center in Kyoto, where you can extend its guide.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was spread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">Within the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers were able to renew a newly opened centre where you can prolong his driver's leading record in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">In a shield, the Japanese word "girder," (kowheundtensha), which means "older drivers" means - perhaps, maybe even with bad backgeons & # 8212; as "awayable motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays at the entrance hall and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, which is subject to social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyoto, and it was also attentive to the local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun's daily newspaper wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such a English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult to elderly people and in an international town like Kyoto's simply acceptable. "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The defective English translation was removed first. "drivers" (deutsch: "awayable motorists") was later replaced by the fair, if the program is not entirely correct, "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police prefecture was promised for the translation stage. however, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been reviewed by translator, and that the translation has not been reviewed in their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A gger reported as follows about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"it is really sorry that older people felt by inadequate correction (the translation) addressed to us," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News sat slightly more detailed with the phenomenon of the "older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "feasible" was matched as an appropriate description of older drivers. according to the police there are the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents, but absolutely cause for worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">For example, in the Prefecture of Kyoto, for example, 1,941 of the total of 19.460 deaths of seniors were created. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, Seniors 1.803 created from 11.850 discases.</seg>
<seg id="364">In this way, their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">Whereas the number of injuries resulted in overall, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period has increased.</seg>
<seg id="366">The well-called reporter revealed in the published version of the article entitled comments to the light that show the prejudices some Japanese fights against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo via the translation errors received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" awful motorists ") about not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">- "So foolishly is the translation or not?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that is a real translation error."</seg>
<seg id="371">There is no such comments.</seg>
<seg id="372">Why "Engrish" is so widespread in Asia</seg>
<seg id="373">Translation errors are widely distributed in Japan and the whole of Asia.</seg>
<seg id="374">The Engrish.com website is a real treasure for these bizarre mistakes in English.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and translate active knowledge of knowledge in the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in case of native language. generally, the belief in the target language - not in the original language - native voice should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French native language should be translated from English to French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language that might translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding, cost-green, or relatively small number of English native speakers that are Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that even have no foreign employees, they will produce each company, but the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is being honored to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrative and rallful phrases that are created by machine translations, show that technology can not replace nor yet a human translators. this is especially true for several languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, among them also the enigmatic reprints, often using T-shirts or handbags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation may be acceptable or at least harmless. but by big companies or from the government to ensure greater standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The town of Kyoto takes up a seriant source of their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the Internet access from VPITV and El Capitolio TV will no longer be available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also overcarried pictures of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositionable groups that resist the Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks on the executive branch and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the bond was shortened, and received the Usage, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to protests on protests since 2014. in that time, the Commission asks for telecommunications when they continued to report about the demonstrations, as the Commission didn't see this as "call to violence."</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is not accessible by a locking by the domain name System (DNS) but also two other online transmitters. this also applies the website where the National Assembly transfers their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that the local Internet Explorer benefited on a technology. this is a technique provided by the DNS-servers of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a website is blocked by the DNS system, the server is incorrect or refuses the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elaboliv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household, where she was not living together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her studies at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house heard of pride about them. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">They turned out of something, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita as Criadita, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a large family with little money transfer their minors son or her husband's daughter to another, richest family. in exchange, the child will receive food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But whatever is not mentioned, the children may have to pay for countless days of housework, who cannot be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that can't stop within the framework of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice is widely used as Criadazgo (Paraguay) due to the participation and acceptance of large sections of society and despite numerous complaints founded by human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing his studies, Alvarenga collaborated for a few years for an organization aimed at boys and girls rights.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness testimonies, cherished and prangerte.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude is implicted, guaranteed to nursing the Criaditas.</seg>
<seg id="429">The Criadazgo is based on a double deception, "Alvarenga explains.</seg>
<seg id="430">It is the family that her daughter is in believing that she conclude her training, improve their position in society, and "can make something from itself," can be sent to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">The other hand stands the family that takes up the girl in itself, and whose exploitation by faith is justifiable that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise no training would be hungry and maybe even starved.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Marín in Caaguazú came into the hospital, her body showed evidence of real punches. shortly after that she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military couple Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Meldearejo, who works as an officer at the residence.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in her house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">In late January 2016, Ferreira is defeated as long as a stick to Marín, until it was lethal.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">She emphasized that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply rooted in the grounds of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They marked the Criadazgo as a "modern form of slavery."</seg>

<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the colouring where their father worked, bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Her brothers had to go all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the Asuncion's capital in Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In their employer's house, Alvarenga collaborated between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">They had to know the time so that you still remained a time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">It arrived at five o'clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and the infected basins.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they had finished with the learning, the more leisure time it had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had to never hunger, but won't get even unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the owner than dinner from the fridge."</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the budgetary, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>

<seg id="497">In the course of our history, we managed to conclude systems like slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practise of responsibility), with whom the Conquistadores (with whom the Conquistadores), and the Minquistadores (with whom the Conquistadores) had to be regarded as they were still willing to provide a system of slavery, with which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months of acceptance of the law, users and users would have to register with their correct name and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeastern Iraq region, Hana Ahmed Raza, and her team of scientists of the Nichesgation Organization Nature tried to protect the ghostly Persian Leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of Leopards, which belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor), they are among the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). they are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are based on account of Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they are still less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "Persian Leopard is the only remaining volume in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and thrive of the ecosystem also depends on that a large volume of space is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards in the free game of wildlife is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video thus ensuring that they have a recording of a large cat on the camera, Raza doesn't break in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As trained Biologin shows Raza fond one other side of their country, which is not just war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals for six years and also involved in educational programs from Nature Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with the reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the progress made in the Northeast Japan daily Kahoku Shimpo, which achieved progress in the last six years, was to be rebuilt by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and a Atom accident in Fukushima, had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was a kind of prefectures in Japan, the earthquake and the resulting tsunami had to come.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, as the tsunami had left all the coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, even alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view which have been achieved for six years to rebuild the life of local government.</seg>
<seg id="549">The comprehensive report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuild authority as well as survey results for those concerned.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of its planned equivalent houses (?), saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Ivate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">The largest success under the three prefectures could mark Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima crank it with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">But even six years after the catastrophe, he evacuated each other as six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfsquails (Shapetsu juutaku), in the final replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple-catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such claims.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the Fukushima still lacked in emergency notes, whereas Miyagi was successful in emergencies. more than 75% of the evacuation centres, which were registered after the disaster, were moved to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and daily life in the three affected ectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the misfortune, have opened their doors up until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction is much more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100% of fish fishing companies in Iwate and Miyagi are back in operation, only 30 percent of fishing permits have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and the atomic accident we have moved into quarters in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural areas in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a consequence of the nuclear accident is, because only 690 hectares of land destroyed land of Fukushima, lying in the nuclear plywood. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism improved again, but Fukushima still stays far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent higher at the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima stood here for only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that since the catastrophe, almost half of the territories, it was more difficult to earn their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a complete image, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and under the evacuation. she questioned about the status of repurchasing and as well as their sensation towards the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung declares:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents carried out measures to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed that still have not done enough in matters of catastrophes health prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture,</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the occasion of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung increased their attention also to the location of the evacute from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to live only the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the fecture of Fukushima was also the witness of the worst, disastrophic accident, atomic injuries to the Japan each time.</seg>
<seg id="578">At a total of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated in areas outside of the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people back to Fukushima, where they have been resettled.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the stand of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live out of their home-prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophic areas, most of the evacuation centres are still more than 50 years old. they are in proper assertions that they have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. these are projects for construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak any other language, seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, one however often recognize that a more glimpse when it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important because they extend our prejudices to expand our perspectives and remember that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, let's look at exactly these global links. in our Into the Deep Podcast we handle topics that often earn less attention when they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment that they have felt very heavily with someone about language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 came to the intensive weekend: last Friday, a police officer was defeated at a demonstration in Goiânia with a stroke against the head. millions of demonstrators involved in a protest ramphway against asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on Saturday and have moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">Its condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local sculptress Luiz da Luz made photos from the attack on Mateus, spread within a few days fast in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">The face of the police station is to recognize the face of police officers, which was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Goiás know that Sampaio had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the occurrence of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The images show the police officers, such as it beats in Goiânia with his impact on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (Photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer could be beaten by a police station and landing on the intentional station, his face would be for six months and the entire oppression would justify it.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a press release of media activists from Goiânia, shared by Luiz da Luz, was attacked by Luiz da Luz, in which one sees how Mateus attacked by the police and several renovations.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video shows the same scenes, but emerged from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the shown clip, you can see the Attack on Mateus off the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, living in another federal state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2.700 Euros) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to his family in Goiânia, while he is at the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado is calling for further violations of activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás sees a wave of political force: here the activist Guilherme Irish from his father was murdered, just as he attacked the Occupy in a WhatsApp Center, having attacked the very sorry case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police force, who has hit him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police grips</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil, where it came to demonstrate police reports on Friday last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen set protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had established a stage for speakers, rubber sheds and lacrias.</seg>
<seg id="617">The member, Flavio Serafini, social and peace party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce power against protesters.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media street protests were destroyed by focusing on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disk.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo reported on a brooch glass window to design their title page in illustrative.</seg>
<seg id="621">However, the O Globo favoured the title-story with a fire-placed bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic grounds, more about a broken down window than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This one must also recognize if one is striction against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Also here, the term "Vandalism" is an absurd, unproportional meaning, and the typical acts of violence riveting the military police are cut from headlines with the title "demonstrators at the confrontation course with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories came to the doors of Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central and Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no notable sugar born locally.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in sugar cane factories were laid.</seg>
<seg id="629">After setting the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory lost its plants, until only the scaffold out of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Some 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute to the factories, which are still milled.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who stand every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn't smoke its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the east of the sugar cane factory fabrics, which have been put into operation after a long inactive time because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls exactly that in Mañalich would have received the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resisted the Plages, the Case of Socialism, the low market prices, the Inefficitude, the bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvest is no longer a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway bridge of the village saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The crushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically unfolding, and hardly any competition they were intrageous for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plants and the sugar beats on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nonetheless the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar should remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the present production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar value would amount to around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day is going to enter into history," those were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavelsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as a soldier, says it is about the closing of the factory, the word that he is in most repeated, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Prior to the first half year, the first letters began.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was official and official documents that are only removed regarding parts that would be removed, addressee and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everyone was signed by Ulf Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve each withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was over and the letters were becoming more common.</seg>

<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he demonstrates one of his 31 years of employment.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workplaces has been erased.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many instances there were no alternatives to work places and services that generated plants in the churches, where they were found.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut speech of 21 October 2002, the former president in the eyes of the present persons saw that he had guaranteed that for those areas, whose factories were no longer in operation since five years.</seg>

<seg id="672">Since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only high by Mahlen.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory lock, or better said when they began to disclose them, they also heard the road to asphalted, also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They became to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without future prospect, many young people left the region as well.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area a food factory was created, whose production is not even for the supply of the church.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the first Nations-Communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them. do they have hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop courses directly to schools and youth centers in order to bring youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were guided by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec, with ten Cree-Communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop continues to conclude that young participants in talks as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance" or what is always found in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where youths are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations-Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and has been invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Nebraska in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitshkalum First nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears, in which almost two dozen were mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate, as important the receipt of traditional customs and customs - despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs were published in indigenous languages, though the youngsters have not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that Whapmagoostui Cree First nation added, refrain will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop-Group who gave them a stanza in dialect eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookside of N 'we Jinan is available to the stanza in Umschrift, as well as translation into English, which is translated to German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel when nobody ever would interest to me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I will try to go on earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you will take our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise ourselves one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">They can grow up and to our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus they can do this, wherein she has appointed the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary eil the reader and supporter of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also provides a contribution and add the stanza in silicon writing (which is also published on his blog):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic meals almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers show what exactly on the menu is located near the entrance of shokuhin sanpuru (girder, "plastic models of the dishes") of any food which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic light weights, then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to the production of this plastic counterweights.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo District Judabashi, there is a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes made by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic odds are usually so usual that they will not catch them again. however, a new trend is transforming today in normal mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the bloginii series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new items decorated with plastic coating, such as they are shown in Kichijoji toyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned to kitschy collective objects such as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a couple of Shokuhin cold magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in Essentibility is becoming increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this dirty bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is a apple that contains your mobile:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of a growing flight into the coming.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and cell designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular Topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">There is someone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think, I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic stories can also accept a less appetite form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melodic ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon are also available.</seg>
<seg id="742">More skimsical plastic groceries can view yourself under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter from the hashtag # 1, etc.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to know more about the origin of this trends, this video will give you an insight into the Kappabashi District, dedicated to the restaurant industry. like for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic counterweights are actually produced.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media on the notorious "struggle against the drug trafficking in Mexico, the missed and killed regularly in statistics. these mirrors are regularly not reflected in the extent of the human tragedy that brings together this struggle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug giants such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa-Kartells, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent first, somebody looks at the harvested or to the congregations which have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">We are standing behind every body, behind every bone reservoir discovered in the hundreds of darkened tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds might be heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político created the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (german: "with drug trafficking '), which is told by a voice saying to these victims and stories of people attained in the struggle between the prosecution and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only fear us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are a lot of profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug traffers and all the municipalities are therefore many kilometers to buy some so simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the sacrifice</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "vidas que cambian por el miedo" (german: "as fear is changed") exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is the Guadalupe, a father that is looking for every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father's four siblings, lost her husband and two nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task we decided to go out and to graves for the people who we loved to look."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in a El Naranjo factory.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is still my mother, who also is with me here.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are dealing with the insurance of my Father, but they don't get paid out because they require a certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">Editors from "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have the faces of those who represent fear. we have to lead the international community the conflicts and state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a writer from Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, State Guerrero in Central Dalmatia.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution is reminiscent of us that violence should never look as normal, no matter what it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I know disease and sensational journalism now already since several years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass each day to newspaper kisks and see the title page with pictures, that can only come from a textbook on criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It will bring me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who saddens or sad. it seems like a lack of respect toward the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be equal or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs through the "herosia" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who have fear that something happens to them too.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to blows numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The crime of man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighboring town that they were sinned. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they don't think that they spared from such tragedies if they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months extortion in the Capital District: like a family with threats, it was depressed for month money of her business until the end didn't only destroys the business, but also her family torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never leaves, trauma remains, the fear rise again high if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits changed, phone numbers have also changed.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">They completed their report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, for you don't know when they're kidnapped or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether Wah would cry out my deeply rooted feelings, but the reply is no, for I have forgotten how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the "The Forgotten Kids from Ciudad Juárez: a generation by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In introduction he raises questions about how: who cares about the child of a miserable woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What's it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like the other boy of his age, whose parents tend to take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he told that he had to teach himself how to make a egg cook, potatoes cooked, tortillas warm and "chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He talks about the nine scarves on his left leg - one for every living year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unpromising for a boy for the whole life of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, man told him that his mother had vanished.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood already past two years before, when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody Leiche of his father saw that had shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation looked like in Juárez like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by organised crime and struggle with the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders for public safety and government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecution filed 3103 Morse. this equals 8.5 morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories still live in the headlines. this project reminds us of those who we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" initiated the data Journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against the drug trafficking over the country that has tortured the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the years after something that emerged in social media? content in social media, whether or true, tends to persist further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it was used irrevocably to cultivate tragedies, which actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of image and event - "false text" or "false text" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are much more careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But he raises questions about our longing to pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tankvehicle crossed the place Squees in the east of the DR Congo, collapsed and exploded. 230 people came in life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa was neglected in the second largest country for years and thus devastated the streets in the region have become more dangerous strands, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">The tank car fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">The authorities of the authorities described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinemas near, which was full of people that looked at the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">The houses burned and burned corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the insights.</seg>

<seg id="832">An example is for this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows the lost body, which are caught on the floor during the floor.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was caught on social media, blogs and other platforms, but don't falsely attributed to tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 Boko Haram attacked the Boko Haram remote village of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically from atrocities where they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were put in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "nobody stayed there to count corpses," said a resident to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many have been buried, shot and burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite pictures, the folder could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Niger and the attempt at Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo again shows as proof of the fact that the possible degree of attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false descriptions; Africa check-arrangements has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was given as a cover for massages.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further will bring personal comments such as this example, from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>

<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against the Rohingya, Posts writes like the following to summarize these descriptions with photos from the DR of Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a Saudi Arabian's message. in 2012, the President of Myanmitars "s alleged, monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition she had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information.</seg>

<seg id="918">The image has been revealed as a cover for the Boko Haram massacre (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages that were connected with them were taken up in no religious context.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong issues or frames (interlude) that captive this postings. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of large discussions about the silence of Muslims through Muslims or by Muslims - for the defence of Muslims - the murder of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing is used to discuss how an African life is evaluated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worthwhile to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens if readers can no longer serve this pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are seventy people with social media, which accidently made a proportion of practising the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of the false and false declarations that actual atrocities are untrue and forgeries the real atrocities of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (here, for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the back of images of a refusal is equivalent to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even asked by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, worry, that violent images and spectators are desolate and identify them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study that investigates how violent media influence the others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there's a lot about violent representations in the news media, fact, fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News", in which a picture is suggests slightly, but in which a picture is being cashed away from the context, or completely abusive species can be used.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e.g., unobservable), language desirable to offer words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in every language: they express specific situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these indispensable words are known today (like the famous Portuguese aspirations) and others, which are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobtaining).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resist persistent every experiment of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not sufficient to understand why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected during a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists are Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog, for example words of the Finishing lap of Vanuatu, as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Beman your parents in recognition of how to make yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language which are spoken in parts of Brazil, like:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness, which you feel after it has been warmed up in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They escape other cultures, reveal others, and curls our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this site and show more of this "indispensable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages", which are highly appreciated by Untranslatable are invited to upload their favorite songs.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be Muslim, on different art. but somehow we all will be put in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on a spoken word. it is a try to obtain and appreciated the diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not disclosed to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the Macher of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we need to accept the diversity - secure spaces, in which residents do not forget, who they are to listen to dairies.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While listening is often associated with it, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers put their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional history, their devotion and their representation is that the audience agree on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call for laughter and emotions, when language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows like a traditional history of Burkina Faso who is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storytellers in Rassidatou conforms also the opportunity to explain the typical conduits of narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fabel of the rabbit and the vellas in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explains the importance of his fabel, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to a crowd who does not understand your language?" with a broad Grinding he shares his feel of the Inklahity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have not heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were very attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of the Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all that are inspired by the project, can contact TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico requested by US redefine the state school</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a realisation of the public debts of Puerto Rico, which took place on 72 million US dollars, took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017, along with the puertorian Capitol, the capitol building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Civil Front for the neurality of the debts) and the Ökomenian congregation of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocate of the debts of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people Puerto Ricos calls that the politicians, banks and government agencies, responsible for debts, are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We demand a financial exam and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions compensation, which is indispensable in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refused to pay a debt that is not her.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not decrease with mercenaries.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We charge immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not into the statutory of the Federal Republic of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," an independent non-profit organization without party membership, with focus on sociology economic development, a law for citizenship, as an alternative to existing state intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">External measures shall be carried out without the Participation and conviction of citizens of danger, to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration carried the name "Night's Revenge for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives filed the campaign for his liberty and recall the contributions he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, is dedicated to an event of the # FreeBassel Campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of the Book of freedom of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective reresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that was published last year and is licensed free here, includes a number of essays that deals with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to base and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the background it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would discuss how movements for freies are built and what the real costs are linked to which this is associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who have involved in the movements for freies have been working on page to view over the nebula and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted by the Edra prison camp, where he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about its current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory portion of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice acting on his release and that they want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel paid a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us can begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why Are We Here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of timely beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activity has been in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel came from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyers Noura Ghazi, said that the "military police Bassel reported on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 they had been contacted by persons that themselves as insider from the Assad government and continued it from an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia played a decisive role in expanding the Internet and to know the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologous, and momentary of the leader of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps not one of Basque's cultural prototypes predicted as the work began to renovate with a group of archaeologist and 3D artists around 2005 to renovate the ancient ruins of Palmyras virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the sign of numerous civilians and here merged with Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was still not knowing that ten years after being started with this work, the IS would set it all about it, this architecture that not only embodies the cultural heritage but the world embodied.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip of digital archeology and the preservation has created a time of time that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Bassel was not able to close this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life, dreaming of liberty and scribe taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed if I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already detention.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked him to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also contributed to other detention how to use computers, at least theoretically, without that they had actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a commission that she wrote her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura collaborated along with the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smelled the lyrics to him when she visited him, and translated it from the Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book covers Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens:</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">I sing in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the bagulation in the moment we embrace in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers doesn't matter me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, boilers and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison's offence</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I enter into every detail your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">I carry this with my passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes may say farewell</seg>
<seg id="1237">Another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my solitude,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To return all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I will witness myself that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1247">Basque history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the protests against the Bashar al-Assads since the beginning of 2011, a Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) have disappeared after more than 65.000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared by the regime, were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died in prison at least 17.723 Syrians in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community calls for 2012 the release of Bassel.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, condemned director back to previous post by dismiserable post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique responded to anger upon a ruin fall, when a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, where the corruption turned over.</seg>
<seg id="1256">In this case, Diodino Cambaza, the 2008 was arrested and sentenced together with four other defendants for 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 Euro) to 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was composed of public funds of the airports of Mozambique, their Council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately ordered his back to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Secretary of Office of the Republic, the proposed application, there would be no obstacle to relate to Cambaza, as the company had no discipline procedure after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens are not doing well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integrated Pública, "CIP), a local institution responsible for public transparency, sentenced to an interview with the Deutsche Welle, the decision of the firm to relocate the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Poses a setback in the fight against corruption and indicates lack of transparency and is even a step ahead to the efforts of our right system, so that CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we know is that the company should induce a discipline procedure against the trade-trade.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent, however, and causes no reasonable steps to use the respective functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim's social media, rejects this behaviour also as "resist":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could observe lectures and motivating things, he could advise and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he is granted to become integrated in the company, who helped to add damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Thus it is obvious: Cambaza is to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resist!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn't have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza are rewarded from the state because he cannot believe him that someone claims someone in such a way that has already insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morals to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state when it was a faint financial source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was uploaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief belong to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">The thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only remain as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, one-cutting and incidentally - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous representations, it was energetic so that "an ambitious man is capable of to sell his own individual interest in his ambitions."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he won't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An honest man is also criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were refusing:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he sat down for 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today he puts him the company, in which he is the voire of unfaithful, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - сти αγοк) (@ azmal _ Rafik), May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook recalls the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and is censored many users to injustice</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burmesial word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or a switch bosses.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their postings out of the net because they played the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or in general as an adjective "Indian".</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or "(in burmesial script) as part of an initiative to deal the widespread problem of speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical national movements of the word has given an extremely low-curing cotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as a speech against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in terms of Beman, Hasslanguage in Myanmar, the company has licensed a lot of sensible content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'is usually associated with racism, but the word reminding doesn't call an enemy language.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts in which they discussed use of the word or doubts two of its use as used.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are several burmese words with different significance to have the same sequence of letters like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(spinach),' Kalar Oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebookUser Aung Kaat explained the various significance of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he had asked his friends on spiritual way if he could overcome his back pain when he made a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + Fragranch (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Haller is the opinion that she will kill an enemy of radical nationalists, but it also emphasized that Facebook analytical Look out before all the Posts abolished, racism to spread terracism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook quenched the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It will be filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you read on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should take instead is the post carefully to analyze and control it by using the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (switch).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this dreaded nationalists are broadly spreading a quite good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is at time to cut their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is a strong signal to all send an enemy bugs, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China as Sina Female and WeChat found that the censorship will often have a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networking will begin to use a new word, or an alternative write system of the zenused word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaat described as Facebook began to erase his posts when he wanted to share his friends when he is forbidden to the Word 'Kalar' from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook, and I was forbidden to talk to me, posts and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the post "has not been talking about" the Facebook Community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts of people who have no negative susceptions or that just try to show their opinions against the speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with enemy:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without enemy's speech is removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author convicted his opinion, why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are poorly bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believed that Facebook should have more done before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook Like a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To aging such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also appears as if they have begun this without local context or technical support, such as "chair" or "Erbsencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found it, they did not tried to rectify the vulnerable postings.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had just a little bit of respect for the 15 million benefit they would have a great success, would be the great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship provided for a lot of fun among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Rather than taking it seriously, users are aware of Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage to see whether their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts, which did not abstspeech but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and seatly view a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try if Facebook is the mail removed, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1334">The post owner "If you are a doctor, do you heal?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious Fundamentalists, social networks have been used to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">In addition, an enemy language in social networks will also continue to heat violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the region of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have been forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure to criticise his confident speech at his inmesial pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of aging the word 'Kalar', it would have been better running on the context of the focus of concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The pathead is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, parliament of the Land has unanimously approved a law to ban these practice, so that the full age of age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change, a couple of members prevented Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group representative of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state did not inmingle, as this, age not imfold. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened unnoticed the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN's unlawful Convention, the minors as "defined every person under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the number of children that were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were contested to take the laws on the foot, followed by great support. no doubt they helped to join this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu guide, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of children's sex, they should take care of her own business. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition cared for tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point, doubt, whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite four Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so he could be discussed in the office building where a simple majority would cause it to be a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must vote and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators found on Facebook a Status update which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the Bill's Bill against the Children's House was approved by the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against them.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After being previously decided in the Senate, the draft may now be made to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws have been modified for children.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who sent a minister of the ministry of education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has become too much time and unnecessary talk to deteriorated the core of the thing, but you know what? the marriage is now Trinidad and Tobago now, and that is worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson's mind, there was definitely long enough to take care of the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was happy that the day was finally come:</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia site was presented on 18 January 2012, opposed to the SOPA (stop on Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey closed the popular and crowds-based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information, as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV series defend themselves against the plywood.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technicted Internet users are used to use bypass dies for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times article that Turkey does not have the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), the most usual Wikipedia users don't drop to this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unlocked in 2002 article by Wikipedia, as recently as a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society on Harvard University, you will find regular blockys of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been issued.</seg>
<seg id="1398">China is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform relies all Turkish Wikipedia sites on a decentralized Peer-to-Peer-Network (i.e. computer calculator) which does not support a whole Zensorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content remains observable, however.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reported about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the crossing of Wikipedia), we replaced it all about, snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the contents in the centralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all the Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org myself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also shown that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent sperm.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A sucking rhino, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around himself, never satisfied. they were blended with badly positioned motives and balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">It's motivated to carry him a camera on himself and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">He was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar decided to bring home to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that lenken attention to Nepala.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location assists in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the Rand of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested from home, when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) had called me. he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I got rid of my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river-side, where the leopard was and I immediately began to crack images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives for cooperation with the authorities to achieve global recognition of Nepals nature and would like to understand that wild animals are not so terrifying as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood for tigers already from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger may not be disturbing by the mind of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was in the dark on the way home, when suddenly the king of Bushmen appeared. he immediately went, and let us go and he starves me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar won the Logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for Ecology) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But its passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long and lived in a tent in order to make music from Otters. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds, which live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was posted by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and appeared originally on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published as part of a Content-Sharing Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid care of the greatest care, the name of her husband, or even by older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a tonomous or say "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, to respect women that they should respect the grounds of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should be the norm in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted from the Indian state of Odisha by a headcourt and forciting her family and the village community after she had brought a married relatives with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives are also not given by name, but is also common among men. however, they have no less outright to fear if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the District Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them healthersonal and home frauen, a unique club and became very quickly became the main anticousema of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, discuss the hostess of patriarchs and discuss them.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Being one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, who is operated by the community video Volunteers and relies for the removal of patriarchats.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas works for seven years with the help of her video camera to the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infections, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how this clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made ambassador of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini presented in her discussion round, was forbidden by women who do not call her husband by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue, because she wanted to talk about Patriarchate with a problem, who can easily identify the women.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of her husband is not to speak out loud, as they pleaded not guilty on all of them, and never has questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini unites:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition proves that a woman likes her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who is not holding this becomes a deceitful woman, as woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never did thought until this discussion break.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At start, Rohini wanted to have never mentioned her husband so far, trying to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed her husband's video at her husband and mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video had been finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned aside to me, and said, I will call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage Rohini launched its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">According to video projection the women tried to bring discussion with a practice in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they all asked, "If we could not tell the name of our husband, but they can call us how they want us to respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband on the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra, in which married women must never pronounce the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shy, that during the whole practice it was just cared before, and another decided to recover all the built-in frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression of their faces were ecstatically.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I guess I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenal swap, to have broken with an ancient rob, the women decided they would actually try to call her husband by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini was awarded a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a wife called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into the head: his wife couldn't stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother was silent, she got anxiety and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini report as women have tried to stop other practices, such as the carrying of the fascist point on the forehead, which shows adulstatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the fascist point, if he would do it also.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not ceased to give them completely, but they are now in a better position to be able to carry him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about who could hear something, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in her life she celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems so many years ago and I also have some things to hand, for example, like our identity of our husbands, never actually talked to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It felt great to say some things, no matter how small it occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and connected to it with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have played a saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it is okay, but some wanted a sage curta, a wide shirt over a trousers, wear; they did not drink.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a much dispute and discussion about the advantages of your own choice, the morals connected with the Saris and much more, tasted Rohini her own Couple Kurtas (Obershirt) in a discussion break that women were able to wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa while they can wear jeans and Rohini is safe to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their initial discussion club has already changed, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we only have small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women then tried it a few times, but then heard it again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, shut me, do it still, but only when they are alone and no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of her husband; only one or two women are now carrying a pinny red on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion club know that the changes in their lives would like to achieve greater freedom of movement or your own choice - at the end of a hard to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a victim of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am so.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is sent to us that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman comes home in the club and other people talk about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from deferred groups in India and make videos about stories about that.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on Hong Kong Free Press on July 8, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partner agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of detained Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention to the international community, after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June, that he was admitted to the hospital because of liver cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway started to store in 2010, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that it was nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were once again continued in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to continue leaving the salmon in China, since the exports had been extensively blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spreading that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee had to bring his hope for unconditional release to the expression and lud Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>

<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to comply with its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, maintaining a statutory rights for use of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry called for China in a statement on 29 June, on the Liu's humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures need to be taken to make sure that Liu Xiaobo will receive all treatments, which he needed, irrespective of where, needs his wife and family contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Though the news-channel France info same said that the French government Liu would welcome us back in the land, the foreign ministry demanded that there is no further information out whether France will eventually take him.</seg>

<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectual and concerned citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, as Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the State's Association of New York, the Minister said that many people criticized Dominanz of the only political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is, where most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Cavalier announced the minister of justice to turn the logic to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and offerings, this valuable country is to create, we must finally say that there was no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the indication of a escape from the responsibilities, a breach of obligation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore if you're not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons given by Shanmugam were not very noctive: he defended an idea, according to which one could make the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given to him, he was inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, or New York City, alike towns and permanent cities.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the theme of the River Thames, the good old lyre of the authoritarian makers seem to be forgiven by the prescribed logic, because it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of this week, we were given answers to his American guests in the last week, regarding our press, our itatative, our political system is really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tariff with non-answers rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng challenged Shanmugam to clear his opinion, as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, thus to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our new K Shanmugam would take on their labour to clarify this point if he was paid highly, in order to be part of the city's government.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog his comment, he says concerning the critics that you should begin to read the whole writing of the conference, in order to understand the context of the testimony of Shanmugam, in which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the booklet.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city," than a country, "he explained why the elections being so unequal to Singapore, even if we look forward to free and just choices.</seg>
<seg id="1712">Compared to Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore "is no country, it's obviously not in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment regarding Shanmugam, who as leader of a herane generation, makes such polemic testimony.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that was expecting me - or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of Singapore leaders of Singapore I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that is really true and confident that he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the vulnerabilities of Shangrugam arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmugam sent a mistake, or was it a freudder diver?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we are considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally authentic country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Because he plays an important role within the governmental network, the sayings of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singapina work their military service, but defend only their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay the Prime Minister Invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">That, the magazine Journey of a Decade for the affirmation of Singapore is and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have a lot of pollutures...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We've always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements like "defense of the country especially" etc., but this is not quite correct.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series is by Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most provided in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry, I reply." I'm from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there are little who distinguishes us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">It was so, when I began travelling 20 years ago, Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th September.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always borne little maple leaves on their baggage to differ from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay couples have been legal in Canada already since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously speak very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposed to be regarded as the tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like this types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadian are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">I got many American friends, whom I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would make me nothing if you would like to switch me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly, "nice," being called "nice" means to be a miraculous, gentle, but tragically unsignificant figure, Ned Flanders, "The Simpsons" (who has their own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can reach.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, i.e. normal and essential to be able to earn attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if unnoticed in the background, far from the things that pass around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">As far as I go, I would say that the desire to be free and alone, a main organisation of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to concern ourselves for our own business.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders are called "cute" is perhaps just cool susceptibility.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canoe don't often speak about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">To give us a warm welcome, open kindness, which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Thankfully for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau meets the stage in order to show that Canadian had made more than just "nice". our Prime Minister made Canada too sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a Pop band parodized Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A music video published in Thailand, a music video made that the Junta parody led to power and despite its promise the civilian government continued to restore the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him about his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly, the music video is indirectly linked to the continued military dominance of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video downloaded was posted on Facebook 1.254 times and received 8,800 spikes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month the Charlie Chaplin Video "was blocked by the Charlie Chaplin Video" in Thailand, after a group of activists watched the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies, as it keeps in the situation of the country under the Junta domination.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these images of the video which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand in the last three years have been sustained.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may refer to the drastic section 44 of the temporary Constitution, which granted the commander of the host of absolute decision making important national topics.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program for "initiation" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are considered the critics.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal intentions, whose vague and unclear rules often are utilised by the authorities to offset activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, supervised the online content and persons to which the monarchy is subjected to have been prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand counts a strict ban against "Lese Majeste" (majestic improper).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014 the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later there came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta will continue to buy the junta's decision, although safety experts they warned when buying unnecessary and a waste of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video even shows how people are cast into a black van, before you put them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison because they have replied "confusion" in society and they are threatening long-punishments, they should insulted monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the Teaser of the songs featured the band members of the band produced by Panem "Tribute" by Panem, who was already used by Putsch against the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1803">The following article, written by Dmitri Stateynov, first published on the website of OC Media and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1804">The postwar society was recovering very slowly in East Abchasia, especially in the district Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abchasic war officially ended, but its scars are still heavily visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern part in Tkuarchal show prominent pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya, Shakhta, Polyana and Kharkovava are located in the carbon basins of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, shooting Asia, Georgian and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the biggest part of Russians and Abkhavases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called spirits in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10.000 people still lived here only a few hundred people in these states.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population counts more than 16,000 people after it had barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this area.</seg>

<seg id="1825">"all this is a consequence of the war."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"can I talk to you?" "why do we speak?"</seg>
<seg id="1827">It is still clear. "</seg>
<seg id="1828">Before the war the village was full of life.</seg>
<seg id="1829">There were community centers, schools and kindergartens, who served all of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with faded splendour buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">People who once lived at this location and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union, leaving the borough.</seg>

<seg id="1839">The girl whispers a girl in her friend, and suddenly they leave the destroyed house and vanish.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico, "Mama Africa" migrants hosts their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez leads a little hotel in Tapachula, Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI.org and is published here.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants to cross Europe and Latin America, certain locations are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican City Tapachula, located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">This is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican, a little woman with a corallish-pink diamond frame and gold coloured struts in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is ulged that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians that are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with ground, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Iranian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. Ramírez's, the people come in full minibus and from the top part of the coast they start to call: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet but this year Ramírez already has 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also slept on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they are bought to them medicines you can not treat them with a balm that originates from long journeys.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable surname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurt) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"Yes, yes," he reply with a smile. "I feel really that it suits her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao remains with his sister, hoping to go to Boston to re-find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, however, it is for some African leaders that are on the way to the United States, normal to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had a companion of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells the Haitians and the Africans often travel the route, and that Africans is already talking to WhatsApp on WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companion Michelet, Michelet lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker for the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">For months he is a guest at Mama Africa: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in future with Ms. Ramírez's future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mum Africa is our Mother and we never go again," he will always smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests to send their guests a lot of text when they have gone to catch them, or to give her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez may be well known here, but it is not the only sparks for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter reached Valenzuela and his family migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman found that the bus ticket to many African migrants are to be sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, and then he offered them his house for one dollar a night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are present, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests make.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid at his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he is fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to press the money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for a accommodation and an unknown, a single owner, offered him of the roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives there and tried to decide where the next steps will go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travelers get quietly to your phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems to be happy that her house is full, but it is nostalgic because of whom we went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair fillers who made her a client, some photos of their grandchildren, and many travelers more, Young and Old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs, while she briefly imagining them.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron" repeats each time. "they are already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a CCTV app on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="1960">An Check-Point for Personal communication devices at Xinjang from Twitter-Users (中文).</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, ethnic minority region in China, are forced to reinstall a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the cell-users entered the Tianshan area of the city of Urumqi a cell-notification if the district government competed to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the message is said that the app will hinder to get access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">But there were the authorities to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh Women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app, having exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the announcement of the police, the app would determine the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information, including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service system with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users alerts how much time they spend online and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, with the filters for minors, help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" remote actors or even hackers able to manipulate the home network of a person, or steal it out.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports of digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often darker for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit undisturbances and dissatisfaction in conflict regions, the authorities often encounter extreme interest and security measures as well as routinemingly internet circuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media-Outlet "Images from Mainland China" (??), the censored news in China published, showed photos from a Checkpoint, on the policemen that were institutional if they had installed the CCTV app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notation requested that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you're detected at a Checkpoint with one device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are compelled to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of bondage due to an investment technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (eg. = &gt; = fee). in addition, a Jing.ang product description is out of which the software can capture the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and cell phones in Xinjiang becomes electronical handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may have an reaction to the instructions of the City of Pareiras, to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government purposes, Authorities and with the Party associations, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office, to operate their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report from Freedom House, a US American human rights organization, also referred to this new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Urumqi a decree with the order to all the inhabitants and entrepreneurs until 1st August, their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable drives, notebooks, and media storage cards."</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously those "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy them. this action, however, breeds the personality of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other potential treaty, including those who refer to peacefully religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2001">They have me and arrested my father three times, but this was not enough, that I formulated my lesson "as the boss of the Security Service - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He made his power over us, by making even the simplest concepts, which we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five adolescents were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was sufficient to create the town the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" - scream.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the districts were coveted, only my own.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time, it was quiet, to the wrong time, even if I had no high demand to a city that is punished to the arteries with government security and their accompliments.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night, things had calmed down, after the power supply stopped in the quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence, by which I cried with several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house chess.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice through the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends felt courageous enough to summarize.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, true friends joined me; we allied us to a gorgeous image that my expectations full and fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="2013">In such a moment, you are aware that you freed the spirit from the lamp, but it simply does not care in the least.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "making you ready to meet us at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: how much honey you can swallow yourself - nothing can give you back your voice, after that you have taken the way up to the office of the Security Service out of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, even as I do.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The Colonel Ghassan begins to say: "let me listen to how you write 'Allahu Akbar', or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not nearby."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His eyes-filled eyes stood on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you just sit yourself what, look at my eyes, and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did did did nothing with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, the fourth time I was standing before this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Perhaps it was about my folly, vanity, perhaps in the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my cause when I said: "I would not thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I have never stopped to look at you in the eyes, so why would I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest entertainment that could have fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret word from what I said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"it holds him in solitary confineness and his father."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father, right with him."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence is to me in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He became a syndrome, "a spiritual torture, which I was exposed to months.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I am crossed the farm.</seg>
<seg id="2033">I leave everything with me in the first office what I carry with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Then back through the yard and the second office, which leads through one aisle to the individual cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I am embraced for all details before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise, they probably have assigned a bigger cell in this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with only one other political prisoners and allow me to use immediately without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a couple of minutes felt like a whole life, the officials left the cell, and I grabbed a well proven communication method: with fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell fin was a "Aesthetic".</seg>
<seg id="2040">He did not hesitate to hesitate to contact me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in none of the cells, there was a highly regarded man middle age which looks similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In perfect darkness let me know no marked factions, and physicians do not give it; we are all numbered.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my sounds?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers were destroying his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The agent assures me, they would leave him off when I abide.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would like to have had a scarecrow to expel all these crows to pass the fruits in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I still hear "Allahu Akbar" from the distance.</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be approximately 10 o'clock in the evening; always kills the cry, every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that I saw the color of the current, until I saw the yellow light, which presented us the gray in person: the Raad (about: "Donner," playing on the 13th caster of the coran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"they are here to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="2055">Thus, the secret has been revealed: to protect the state security before us and to prevent the traitors and terrorists in us, they played their faith in the alawitch dialect. thus they played their faith in the conflict with their world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house, this is not a country; it is a curse to turn her coexistence to transform the crime of her clan into a heroes.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I enter the hearing and meet Abu Imad, a slender and flaming man; at least he will come to me.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my boy, you are still young, you're still young, you can take a lot of importance as you can join the diedical and demonstrate your demonstrations as soon as you will find an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have accustomed to answer it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say when insults and punches after a friendly conversation for me become a common means of communication.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened, was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used myself or misused to become punished, although I did nothing to earn this sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2064">To punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It begins with a plastic tube which probably originates from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your headsman was rejoiced in your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can't measure you with him, and you will not return your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams are not enough yet enough to replace the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had been working as a landlord or whether that belonged to normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables linked to each other to present the invention of a huge cabels.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour, three of them are seldom enjoyed while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all my mind in my body - and my voice, which I heard it.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker remarked the cooling and didn't make any favor so it's next to an electrically charged bar.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed through my whole body, enough to supply all my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-blade body, which was stretched out on the ground, was the perfect grid leader.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness was vanished and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two horrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It has to have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep back again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours of travelling which came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning bet.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens, and the morning light meets the space. "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I am answering your youngsters: "my lord, my father must make a terrible worry."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and get you, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they have always released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>

<seg id="2097">With his music, often faced with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of the whole Arabian world. all these topics do not only reach the core of the entire Arab world, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib was looking for a limitation that in his mind is not restricted by limits, and he can have compassion on their own testimony with people who suffer from foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, the Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not exist openly, he heats an important inclination against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his sympathy for those who try to do something with his identity as a "Palestinian vulnerable of the second generation," he himself describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan, never in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living conditions so," emphasizes Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a person, while he shook Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan, in that time it is planned for Muslims, from dawn to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Iranian law is said that the public consumption of food is illegal in the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib had a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do little with protests against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically talk the slaughing of lukewarm coffee and pigs of the cigar cigarette in the nose first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you throws a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>

<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior of the Interior of Jordan was cancelled due to the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary committees supporting the Islamic Front front support - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argument that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts Hamed Sinno, speaks to the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert is.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokeswoman in the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs as the Arab Spring, human rights and free speech expressing in the Arab world, endangered the legal legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement Mashrou'Leila appreciated the jordan people as "progressive subsupporter of human rights" that will continue to use an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simple to be the rhetoric, but actually becoming evident-crystalline reality reflected in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs's work clearly to the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib shrunk traditional gender norms as he canceled his vision of the fate of Arabian women who have voicking sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the Skeleton of a apparently ironed woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost her life through the hands of them which they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the last years, Jordan set the number of 'honorary' stride '- the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to that, the number of Honestnuts in 2016 reached its peak, however, that Jordan did not cause an institutional infrastructure to promote the victims of murder or domestic violence, to appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for criminating control from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence, "and for her release is often necessary for many years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee of the family that nothing happened.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for this, not to retreat themes drawn in his country for long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib raises that his work is politically, but cleared that he is his music, which is full of explicit allusions on sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I have pronounced in a policy of politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse of verse often follows:</seg>
<seg id="2131">You are free, and every other is it. "</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of course, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words, "which you can" - be it faith or belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that any someone claims to Jordan on the rights of gay and readers, and that comments on the order of LGBTQ + individuals still be censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib taken an interview for the popular jordan online programme Roya in order to notice that his comments is torn out of the context, turning away his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a worked version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib raises the opinion of the Arabian LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance toward homosexuals did not say Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nueva, a poet by the eighth century, who still stayed here thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks itself: if Abu Nude who would work later on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century is not able to write homosexuality, why can Jordan do not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashmere kingdom there is nothing new that the Government attacks on freedom of expression and triggered progressive votes to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordan news service organised several former government delegates and members of the Teacher requested, with the grounds that they had expressed himself on comments in social media interrupted themselves with the deep in the land-root corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs say according to the top of the Iceberg - the actual challenge is to act an Structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him is progress of complete grief and take taking. Jordan went to a show for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it looks like ddaib - is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Iranian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib taken as millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreamed of his work to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them who are to experience. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is concerned with music, art and literature of a true and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, stripping and on artificial art. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it's time, Hdaib is going to continue and thus resisting resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warps are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually taken in August in many opposing Tohokus and from a period of time they were delivered in the north east of Japan to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi in the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could take a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally) organized a joint venture in the capital, Meguro Gajoen.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have long been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two wagons are just right now.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nonetheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, taking the Nebuta festival the only true - and also a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the North of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most prominent harbour, located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road robbery and illegal drugs are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of this region's population will not feel secure.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other middle and South American countries - rising demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend is the appearance and the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Brazil) has led to the experienced hands of hairdressers in the experienced hands of hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2172">An exceptional demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, even an annual event inspired, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts facing each other to show, who can create the most eccentered Looks as you can see in the following video (other videos on public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found itself in El Callao, found here a chance to suade young people to suade their weapons against hairdressing tools, and instead of bad counseles, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated from this activity and that bietters have seen dozens of young people that they can conceive a profession which is currently in fashion.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the worked version of the submission "Liebesverishments at guerrilla fighters" who published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who know we?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important than people who feel betrayed, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Pármita from the Young-Youth Foundation not more from the head and inspired them to write the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged, guerilla raged letters to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, recently, their country was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to its part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace agreement with the Guerronal Armed Forces of Colombia, which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signatory of the peace treaty as such that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Kolumbians there is still a long way to talk from real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillakfighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a war of war and around the clock its weapons must now have been integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrillas then must now come to their ranks and supporting it with building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumbians have to come together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And it's exactly what they did, until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love story to former guerilla soldiers to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one of each former guerrilla soldiers - to be handed to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was held in Bogotá, in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the man we love to write thousands of love letters in the Valentine's Day, but those who need them much needed.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan to tell us further to share his love with people who needed the most urgent playback.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan, letters to write full hope and support for the FARC census, who now have to find their place in society and find themselves a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to do the discourse of a story of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cali, Mancyales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I have never thought that someone would be forgiven me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the region of Caldono-Cauca, 19 March, during March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the foundation of BogotArt have travelled to the camp to translate the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC settled as they had done before, in order to meet the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters full of minds from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings to walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff in the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, this unforgettable experience so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we handed over the letters, a former fighter led me to the camp of the Guerilla soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I entered into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live), I saw a guerrilla soldiers who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had fear, because in the bed, there was a MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I said to him, "Hi, what do they say?" he answered, "I reply to a letter which someone wrote me." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It 'a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone did something so beautiful, so I answer it. "there was no tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him entirely and sat down beside the Grenade Launcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was the war, it was leid to be all those years of faithful companion to this fighting, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life. he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famine. "I have never thought that someone would be forgiven me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company without a society that is waiting with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start-off students and some leaders of the FARC arrived at a discussion break.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC imposed the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views over the peace process. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this range, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">They had never heard that yet never heard yet hearing, and to recognize that the people I had seen as a monster, and even those who had learned most often as a monster that were surrounded by their living conditions and the environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Reality, in which the country lives, is hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - including those who killed and so much damage caused us to bring us something and a big smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp at Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians became apparent that peace would rule after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it provides inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there are always people who are ready to lift up and strengthen them for their rights. and that is entirely justified...</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now put on peace to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they listen to themselves over all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word to make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know of their own experience that nothing is simple. that among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman out of Grozny who has shared some of their experience with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ-legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines, after several months, the reports were released that the towing, torturing and killing queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Militina in the Novaya Gazeta; it cast a light on the methods of the Chechnyan authorities, suspected the suspected queer, and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transine, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt as early as her childhood, she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was educated, you knew that Chechnya had no safe place for them, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens who had learned about the sexual wife, the hunting was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear about her life she moved to the USA last year.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer Helferin working for a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transine that was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone who thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of mine. "then there is no men more in Chechnya who can resolve these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">Then I made the photos of my documents through the whole WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing, a few shopping bags of returning from my cars, I heard a male voice: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I feel something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on a table: "how long will you teach the family more enteaty?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I don't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost awareness and vigilant last grandmother in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to get everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurse were you laid - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name, but the doctor stood and laid down to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got to do with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful for him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">In the last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The desired to send me to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They exhibited absurd claims: some said to me, I mute to prove it by the roads; others wanted I have changed in the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grains size C - what would I have to tell on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said to my mother again on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world that does not only damage your family, but the entire republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you're a pious woman, but you will need to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she laid out a cord around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily came the neighbours and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a darkened window plates and a number plate with a number of 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened, I became clear that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-legal friends tried the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you braided?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to give her name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without going without ID, without passport, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and put it in the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and check into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I was a SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe in safety only because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">You know, in which hotel you are plugest. you even know your number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That actually was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the sex talk about it, that's a tabuthema.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still trench some traditionally kauccal elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So I also wish to overcome this silky barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I am saying that while my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I really give me trouble, how the person look like to look out of its past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But it is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who entered into Argun a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told no man arrested during Ramadan, and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could not wait to wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So, I mean, they probably loading the relatives with the person affected by the affected person, and at the end they require a proof that the so-called "honour" caused by blood curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are they even captured by gay men in these secret events?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says it's just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If so, especially those who have no rich relatives or that were left from their relatives, to set the Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are arrested there, so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be converted, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have been attacked in the village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people hadn't just vanished, but specifically showed up to radical.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a guess or have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after it had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was with us when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, they were not presented as bandwidths, but there were no reports to date. but we assume that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave this man?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and demonstrations of people listen to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair length.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, I had never had problems at Sharia.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to lead us to "civilization" and ultimately won us back in the stone age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were faint, I had painted eyelashes, tubes and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The ministry of safety of the Sharia never has just a hair curved.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grozy there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks standing, and the whole city knew it, they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a reuse: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spans do not talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never preached me, never ddared and never before.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on television over Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak of us via se, but primarily on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had laughed and laughed before, consider a suspicion with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During this time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the republic is constantly worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity can you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">I've always seen as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for about 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise Teetreffs, income, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food maps.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have any cents for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered those people, when I dispersed refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: are you going to go from Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alant.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature of doing nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who wants to show you with foam in front of your mouth, that there are no coils.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which the Cabardines have which the Russians have also - but on the planet they are - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is very pleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during Ramadan's masts - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think at Potsidentity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a bug.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of empire, to be exact, different living settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry, I am sorry, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad about it - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the verified Arab ancestral community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz Region suffer from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a sharp increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab worker in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-combustion of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab ancestral society in Iran, marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi had married and had one child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered anxiety, depression, and he bowed himself for his own helplessness to present the unability for his family, so hawazi people of human rights who wish to work in Ahwaz and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube hosted the moments after he had sinned himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to erase the flames again, and Moramazi was taken into the talent hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, burns were so strong that physicians could do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that was eradicated in August within the Arab ancestry minority, and activists on-site warn that more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ancazi Centre for Human Rights reports that this month, some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: it was all the family-väters who felt thanks to the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab ancestors suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a majority of the Arab ancestors living in Iran, has been rocked by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to deny its population of the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestral was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-monarchy took power and took great efforts to finish the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Achwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most richest and most valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victim of untreated diseases, hunger and delays.</seg>
<seg id="2416">Iranian regime is denied by the ancestors in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a wide variety of demons, water from the Arab areas in the Persian regions, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dembs have only led to destroy the desolation in the region by drought, and the local agriculture and the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi young now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for collaborative, work and social welfare, reports that 5% of Ahsazis who completed a job, who finished primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% university graduation.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Anemazi human rights activist with residence in London, tells Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethical discrimination," said to a "high rise" the number of suicide among the young ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi has said that particularly the unemployment rate has become worse. reason for this is a combination of a high number of ancestors in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the adjustment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not setting Arab workers, the local Arabic Ahazi will withdraw access to workpossibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, and to force her life outside of their home.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their lead and surnames to hide their belongings to the ancestors, as even the Arabic name of the workplace will not be tolerated, because the speech of the Arabic language or caring of Arabian clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the given circumstances caused by the Arab ancestors, the rights activists suggest the alert of human rights before the situation will explosif.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world wakes up and having knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is impudable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I cannot identify with feminism, also with the interlock not"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is an revised version of the opinion that written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website, the article was subject of several discussion in which many different positions could be expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, react in many women - especially white women who are themselves as interactive feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well done scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all Feminist *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women presently earn less money in spite of equal education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still concerned, women and later in various areas of life goes to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and religious devices.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that, and I threaten it twice.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I have to speak on rassismus, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ congregation, or on black women in the LGBTIQ-community or on black women have been abused, both in and outside of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersection Feminists decided to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they are all agree that women - all women - together ought to come together to sing "their voices" and Kumbaya, my lord 'to sing "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not talk about that, in addition to sexual violence, there is an institutional form of racist motivated violence that we are subjected to black women.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnias and herefactors could earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The girls and girls with an immigrant background of the school proved to be the white girl, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women have exposed to higher risk in black sphars and women with a migrant background to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all men, all men, and all the men of all the same rights; otherwise I can not move away as black woman, in whose center the white woman is refusing to consider, injustice to regard to the gender as well as for the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and no more to fight my belongingness in a white-feminist hasshoist, which always have rejected me and many other black women always rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a decent and margin</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which are absorbed by cultural appropriation, absorb our customs and customs to enforce their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to lay white women on the importance of the cutting of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to become the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersection Feminism was founded, in order to treat women of different heroes and turn from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I take it before, to resolve me, and to join the movement of the neomanism, which was set up for my dark skin and to redeem my status as a woman, rather is persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in our own ideas and put us into the spheres that are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: as we can defend ourselves, in which they are able to represent us and in which the cultural, spiritual, silky, physical and even the spiritual elements can be admired to the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and interptionaries immediately call separatism and exclusion immediately after these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can feel black women and women of other cultures, because I still exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment where my life doesn't have passed nor is rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">In the past 7 years, Nabil Musa relies in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in the canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region. its mission is aiming to make people realize the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary of Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the influence of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a kid," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dust, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which operates and works on it, "the rivers, rivers and water channels in Iraq, as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa presents the urgency and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journals, produced, filmed and published in Erbil.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The main emphasis of its work lies on a few notable subcultures and is characterised by the use of cooperative video photography and new multimedia techniques that can tell their stories about their way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The Wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# residence einefraubin) which reports about women's waters across Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police missar said Ada Báez, that she could not have been doing nothing against Luis Balbuena, who had become more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police, her sayings would be laid to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena was anounced for abuse, the histological advert of Ada Báez was useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman withdrew its display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women have access at all, they generally don't receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many instances, women are also dependent on the men who they are misused. this explains why only 20% of all women who are admit to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution of prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 punches and statisticen2 Invisible failure and a legal system which is not subject to Paraguay: good approach, defective implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find how many women really are harassed, says Myrian González, researcher for genderers on Centro de documentación y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are different data and reports that do not show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains it.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads returned for domestic violence against domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads placed in police are women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace stories. also here 86% of women came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women reported that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show, however, not the true freedom of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen women's Minister Ana Baiardi will indeed appear only a few of this criminal offences. "on any woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women will not do that.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For any woman who are reimbursed because of physical abuse, two women who do not do so, she explained at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">There is no way to suicide in Paraguay, the prosecution of prosecution could not be documented as many women each year murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies due to violence committed by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible failure and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Bryítez was born the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he had given him the names of all of her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she should repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana 28 years old and no longer has been together with Carlos. but for two years, they carried on the psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time they recognizable the most difficult:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would once to be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read in the past I thought that only women happened to be inferior because they let down violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name calling, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described his teachings and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had been isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked orrhetoric, whether he ever raised his hand against them and refusing, his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had been doing so long from Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least a certain tense.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner they were misused.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo network ("I think you") which consists of women all in any way of abuse of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk with others about their experience, listen to each other and mutually support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do, they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner, finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads placed with the authorities without a result and their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a process against her former partner who developed into a terrible legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country, where it mainly went about money, power and influence of its former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay Laws: good Approach, defective implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of abuse is a way of resistors and a fight against corruption in justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echidii, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, can also see major problems with the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, the paraguayan Parliament discussed a bill under the hashtag # Porellas (# Füry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-ewenties) are part of a campaign on Twitter that will be supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law looks ahead, Femdomaine becoming an independent Criminal Tribunal to explain and harder to punish how it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the law text was changed in some points, as well as the deputies for the law, that feared that the way for the decriminalisation of Ababortions should be strictly forbidden, and can be punished in Paraguay, with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was envisaged, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process cost that the victims of violence should have to bear itself, if it simply wish to establish a safe accommodation, to set up the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echidii argues that the law is not effective when the legislature must not provide adequate financial means:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse are being seen as part of the human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a memory thing must take place, that force should not be considered to be somewhat normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent about this facts, and he contributes that the perpetrators go away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to refund the so long ad that abuse is no longer valid than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was issued in the paraguayischen Senate. before that, parts of the law had been changed, but among other things, a passage was removed, which the partners in cases had been deemed to reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2545">Legal media in Oman dreamred a year following the ban on a newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2546">This website was locked due to a report of the information Minister "on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year the omani authorities have closed the independent Arabic newspaper Azamn because of their coverage of corruption in the Sultans.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the newspapers, continues to be in prison, where he remained in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors from Azamn, Ibrahim al-Maamari and zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried before the court, but returned later again.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said who came to power after completing his father, Said ibn Taimur, through a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, he has been disguised as the only Sultan, the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, chief commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Defence, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council of Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of Sultans is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular by inland secrecy, the public freedoms, including press freedom, blogger and other activists to folate, intimidate and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities of peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically become systematically and other citizens, also, their views on the public affairs of the country, as well as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Attacking the Azamn newspaper, the closure of closure and the arrest of three of their editors in recent years is a tough impact for freedom of press in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its inception in 2007 was reported for corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned from the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces, Ibrahim al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, had published an article entitled "High-ranking parties" hands of the justice. in it there was corruption in the judicial system and the interference of high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials accused of suspected Judge of the Supreme Court in Oman to lift a verdict in a inheritance.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, he was charged Al-Abri, Member of the Trial Committee, from ISS before the special department and was arrested on his arrival from the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, ISS took the Deputy Editor-in-Chief Yousef Al-Haj, who played as chief editor according to Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed on certain times after the information minister, announced that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on all roads, including online, starting on August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">The trial took place on 26 September 2016 at the Court of Mascat, the first trial in the trial against Al-Majari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted for malfunctioning of public order, misuse of the Internet and "undermining of government."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of violation of a Public Transport and Slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and funds in the amount of 2,000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). moreover, a year-old career was filed against the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was convicted to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after being the use of "an information network for the dissemination of material that could represent a danger for public order" which was found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a damages amounting to 5000 omanic Rial (13 000 USD) was determined and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">Al-Abri spoke out in a hearing on 26 December 2016, however, al-Haj, however, sentenced to a year and Al-Majari for six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was dismissed in prison on 10 April 2017 in Mascat's jail prison. al-Haj is still in prison, where he remained his sentence prison.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also lifted the decision of the Ministry of Information to include the "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the Court, Azamn resignate, the paper continues to look after attacks by the omani government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On January 8th, the Information minister issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended for three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017 the minister of information personally signed an additional statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the Minister set up a further time against the decision of the Appeal Court decided to reattract the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The andruined barracks of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has been injured in the most recent time in Oman.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further violations, the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercising of pressure on albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to introduce its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the impairment of Azamn and the detention of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the omani authorities are still not ready to prepare a close breach of the media freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the omic authorities:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj shortly and unconditionally free;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a secure environment for the Azamn newspaper, that their journalist can continue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the freedom of press in the country,</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Two reasons for medical research imposed on site, there are two reasons: a lack of health care and vaccines are missing in the special health requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread effects in the poorest countries in Africa as far as elsewhere, and lack of investments in exploration of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research that is carried out by African scientists to develop their own research and technology. greater role of science and technology can only be conveyed to economic growth of the continents.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre Director of Infectious Disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS Epidemic had the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Sambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">When postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself worked on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sambish health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about this research on the future of medical research in Zambia, and on misunderstandings of the media.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as private people).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: currently the focus of my work on the application of research results. I suppress the sambial national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory testing.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think of the most important scientific research topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we just put solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That must change, otherwise we will keep the receiver to be even Macher instead.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we get, are often no applicable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it suitable to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well received.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or come here, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure is not equivalent to standards in developed countries. it costs much money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how great is your opinion for the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students from all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is necessary demand on special scientific education starting at each age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the benefits and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed, things to do, and the inexpensive access to scientific expertise, to display challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can make articles only accessible against payment (called "Paywall"), also the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "Open Source" will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky originally appeared on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred already in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its business provides 114 varieties, such as the outpost, the first plant which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years of work was Morton's work just by his own income and the question, how many salatsby he can get, limiting.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to breastplate it.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Patents are not just for individual sorts, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to sickness, a special red or green or cropped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years more such patents have been registered for more plants such as grains or cartridges. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental guards and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton is still looking for lettuce, but it is no longer necessary, because its work is always even more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is when I lie in a river a rock boulders to whom I got buddy.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "says it." I think this patents go too far away.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if it stops before the court, nobody can breed a new salatsas, because all features are already patented. so he performs as much as possible and trying to find out the features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to use no material to be intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement, which is ever increasing in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("open Source" breeder).</seg>
<seg id="2641">The astronaut of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and ate red Römerlettuce's "Greenhouse" in the glasshowerder "glasshouses" to be cultivated whether plants will be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like that the movement from the IT section are from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seed) is inspired by the motion for free "open source" software that presents alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was summoned to make sure that some plant species and genes are not protected as a spiritual property and used for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeder can also be committed to use that others can use them from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" Open Source "breeders allow only to buy business and to buy it." open source "breeders allow for others to breed it, and not to extract as own varieties that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark prospect</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emergence of Professor of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI member of the Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, it plays an important role in a greater union like biodiversity, rights of farmers, control via food system and use of chemicals in the agriculture. independent breeders would try to use latter, the latter is well chastened with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not. "who are offered on farmers in the global agricultural industry," says it, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary sovereignty without seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide other seeds with other seeds. thus, their approach is in contrast to patented seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies are endangered because the available gene pool because of the always numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which therefore always restricted goodbable, rumbling blocks.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the OSSI, is engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about one-third of all the boxes are protected as a spiritual property, making it either usable for plant eders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates does not exist yet, but experts such as Luby suggests that massaculate plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of sightings</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they are targeted desirable features - of such, due to their taste or its color, until such, due to them in certain environments such as skillingen or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Enemies of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders by getting more patents decreases. however, genetic variability is currently more necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions are predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto recognise Monsanto Speaking in Carly Scaduto is critical and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four commercial banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company dedicated itself to preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It said, however, this is said that spiritual property enhances other breeders, since "Patents and the Protection of Plant Nutrition Innovation." a patent is considered to follow soon as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">So such protection does not inhibits innovations, but promotes that more material and know-how can be provided by the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this completely different: 20 years of waiting, until a patent christening, fördere certainly does not require innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait too long for plants to be cultivated in plants, they would have lost the fight against the changed environment.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources still could have been a general well and also remain: "independent plant eders neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers' farmers' work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">It is what us fuels us, and it will be impossible for us, if we do not continue to use the best and genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton does not disturb the concept that attract plant characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form them from and as breeders, we finally did no idea of how the plants do so.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who bred a variety, also cultivated its own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who are interested in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, which are used to produce herbicide, cultivated in its varieties of this concept.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just miry. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are) patents, but smaller than Monsanto are able to survive the most smaller seed company, even without patents - either refuse it to pay the patented or they do not reject it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant manager Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders to innovate by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I can produce new efforts to produce new, stronger than corporation who patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors are to sell my varieties within a few years, "he says." with a patent man is protected against competition for 20 years. "worldwide, it is very nice to make." worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be leaders in the "Open Source" breeding, however, the concept is rapidly spread out all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, a "open source" seed program works by farmers and helps them to breed new varieties to fulfil certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports you to get to "Open Source" and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation agreements is working on an "open-source" license that ultimately represents a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breeder differ from country to country because of the OSSI commitment cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive branch of the European Union, declared that conventional gezüchtant plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents on conventional cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a declaration was not a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States, to bring the Patent Office to transfer this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos held a conference on "Open Source" Saatgutters and representatives of governments, non-governmental agencies and seed trade companies from whole East Africa to learn something about the "Open Source" Saatbenign and the worldwide trend for sponsoring seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for the Hivos' program for "Open Source" Saatbenign Systems, that the organization is currently responsible for a global alliance for "Open Source" seed system systems, which will be the official start of the official start date.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international Nonprofit-development organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publishing the Seed Map Project, a seed Map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, Global Alliance for the Future of Food, Global Alliance for the Future of Essential artists such as WW Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report will have to come on seeds, making use of seeds, making it possible to ensure a stable supply of food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report it is also emphasized by the importance of a diverse, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection, by the Luby of OSSI, hopes to recognize him more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has pounded to it, where and how something is grown, and seed system have hardly ever played a role, so Luby." we try to clarify men, that even more behind their food. "</seg>

<seg id="2730">Now the blog which he instituted to handle the regime of the Egyptian government, even goal of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of renting zias blog is home, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist spent almost 500 days in captivity, after spending in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces, while he reported on the student protests and a video going on how police exercised violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article will focus on politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada expressed himself on the plywood through the government and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to block blogs is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sissi priority; and even if the retainer of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is managed to give me the feeling of a siege; A violation, an acquainty murder, loading at the national security Council, the observings of blogs, and any other web page, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First of all, I used it to the post of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked him and that they have fear of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">They encourage the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and expression (AFTE) blocked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this collected technical tests across the networks of various Internet service providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the notation of providers, through the enveloping of Internet and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we launched how the rejection of Web pages that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content, which might have access to the Egyptian user.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will also deteriorated, causing the declining seats behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population does not have the legal basis for which it can proceed with judgment against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The people argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army for use in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via Photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Newspapers tell us throughout Brazil with dark news from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the second day was murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Diebe robben Pharmacy with military weapons," "president Temer sends 8500 soldiers to the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">The Belaltwelle 2017 in Rio reached the highest level of the world since 10 years in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO-organisation for Global Justice even called to attack the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports about these are everyday, and this is unacceptable and # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So the most detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16 the Editorial "Das is not normal," where they announced, a new column named "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motive for her decision explained the paper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes reported in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual felony, etc. everything that occurs from the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to view our eyes as journalist in front of the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war rubrian in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper declares that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843, it will be controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We deliberately know that a course of war can be discervelled, even though it can be used, scouts of the police who have to push and then ask questions, to be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend war on information and struggle against corruption by the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" more than they use?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil has argued the violence as "war". this is her opinion according to a justification of the failed safety policy of the media and might seem to draw accountable to the police for calculating.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself has shown - in combination with inadequate investments in staff, enlightenment and a historical and self-constrained investment of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">A reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A peace march towards Niterói in the state of Rio de Janeiro in honour of the murdered cultural event Rafael Lage.</seg>

<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is the most violent location in Brazil, according to statistics from 2015, according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No such cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">If we look at the Mordrates per federal state, Rio is ranked 16, "writes them.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Specially the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília is emphasized, repeatedly has repeated the security policy of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">In addition to these safety policies, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the police unit, whose aim is to conquer a Favela, and establish a unity permanently there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At first, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. since several years UPP does not actually protect against the poor congregations and repression against the poor congregations, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist, João Paulo Charleaux, from one of his article from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio is not defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides legal issues, the classification of Rio as war is attracting serious consequences for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls on the state to assert the state and ways, which are typical for a war. this one belongs to the territory of a "enemy," where a civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape and the object for "collateral damages" and "trimmed balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War, or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas suffer from Rio to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week, it is now that the police attacked the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho valley to get the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Amidst all this violence also made this incident. an orist died due to shots who had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2811">The head of the project, subscription Nabil, said to AFP in the French media agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for the cultivation of fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because one can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reported Global Voices that has been fighting for three years, this project has been known and expressed his relief, that it now wins more and more. "</seg>

<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production from the regions of Pilzseeds" before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Afterwards they planted a small pilzhof in a pan. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have created a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they spread mushrooms in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings who had conquered the short-life pro-Soviet government. so Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghan, for the last time together with his family at dinner together.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat had just been murdered by the Taliban, and many Hazara were suddenly hooked.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban was ever closer to their hatred on Hazara.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara forsook the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape Asharaf found itself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a carbon pit. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then, he took the left, and was left in Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country with other refugees and towed bags with mortar, heavier than he himself, to earn his life.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Today, Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard." at an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we don't refresh at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without Papers in Iran, and made himself for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">At the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, unowned Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his demand, Asharaf joined Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Ashark's homeless, ran only across the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that shared twice a day meal to needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of chance for asylum seekers. it is also true that the conditions that seekers seekers to find catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights organisation "Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the System" suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers is housed in more than 3000 "special reception centres." they are improvised by improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and preparatory staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seeks can only be allocated to a reception center if they are officially designated a request for asylum - that after the registration of the asylum seekers can go up for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for a accommodation either assigned to the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it took also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his thirsty life-life helped Ashark to set free from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After he had done several years working in the building industry, Asharaf acquired its entire production space in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">It was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while and opened one fast.</seg>

<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transition solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years a couple of Afghan companies, including snow, travel agents, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even placed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea to his restaurant Oriental Experience in which the waiter and the kitchen staff have largely liberated refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells about the various Afghan, Irish, Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneurs Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs aims to extend far beyond the Italian food industry and retail prices, and aim for the country that he had to leave out as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are also ways," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgot my land, and I can't feel happy when I know my people.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers in the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and must get the same options as all others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Ashark also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which the human packaging and preserving techniques were able to sell their victuals and improve their financial situation, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts, but at the end is stability and prosperity.</seg>
