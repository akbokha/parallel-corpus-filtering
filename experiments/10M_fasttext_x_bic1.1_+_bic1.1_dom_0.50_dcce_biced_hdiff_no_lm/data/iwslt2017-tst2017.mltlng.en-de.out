this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times Award .
before ever som@@ eb@@ ody played by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published his N@@ SA illegal tele@@ phones of Americans .
but it is a different chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in it , he describes a cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic US econom@@ ies , where the CIA handed down his dra@@ fts to atomic bom@@ b for a nuclear bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , you may read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know , whom the chapter doesn &apos;t work at all ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years the government of R@@ isen has determined and ur@@ ged him to call his alle@@ ged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower to condem@@ n and pointed out journalists .
according to the first const@@ itu@@ ents , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media cannot get this information , and if they cannot be able to protect their identity .
therefore , when the government came back to R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous re@@ porter did so : he ref@@ uses and said he would go to jail .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen has lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something unusual is happened .
suddenly , though they say that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring , re@@ por@@ ters and sources can hide and less .
instead of fail@@ ures and cr@@ ises to express ideas , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investigation , without his consent , his phone number might be wor@@ ried ,
as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his loan agreement , and even travel@@ ers with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that she used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has convic@@ ted more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government had agreed too much from their work as a home .
since September 11 , almost any article about national security had been the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the initial const@@ itu@@ ents , because the government has more ways to sc@@ or@@ ate all .
but just like technology of the Government permits the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies in order to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can contact the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward .
today , communication software which has not yet been written as R@@ isen has written , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed from the Internet most famous , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I am working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can send documents to documents or information , as in each common contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only has access to the current news agency .
so the government cannot aff@@ ord more information about it , and many of the information that they would require it would not be available from curtain .
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments over the world are always developing new sp@@ y technologies that all end@@ anger us .
it is safe to ensure that not only technology companies such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to apply mis@@ fort@@ une . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the har@@ vest@@ ing of soldiers in the supply of soldiers sever@@ ely white and of over@@ filled hospitals reports . or the next environmental worker , the alarm goes down to se@@ ize water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who war@@ ned us of the next financial crisis .
at least , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crime but to protect us all the const@@ itutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest dat@@ ab@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that king@@ doms of money was hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Palmer of Global Wit@@ ness to make a statement . &#93; This week we were sent by news about a run@@ t@@ angle of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ cat@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small in@@ sight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca , and say : &quot; well , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of news , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad ur@@ anium companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alle@@ ged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin will lead about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , the ner@@ vous place to wait for the next release and to the next unve@@ iled documents .
the plot sounds like the plot of a coach or John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ Romans .
it seems aw@@ k@@ ways from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty in the location are to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ases , and not all of their taxes pay for important public services such as heal@@ thcare , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading polit@@ icians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some a few , can be h@@ iding and deter@@ ior@@ ated - something that we have been discuss@@ ing and unve@@ iled for ten years .
I think many people will make this whole world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s difficult to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind those pra@@ yers .
it can be very difficult to understand pun@@ ish@@ ments and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society , what thing is .
I think it is also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
pres@@ um@@ ably because there have been no prominent Americans that occurred in these re@@ vel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there is no enough Americans that you may hide in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by this principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ el Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
we could have a dat@@ le@@ man from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to specify a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparent in the U.S. has allowed it to carry out scho@@ ol@@ homes , students .
it is allowed to zoom off , particularly vul@@ ner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator at the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave herself to an African minister , who wanted to bring down money to the USA to buy a house of a private jet .
it really sho@@ cked us , that all heads made to our investig@@ ator &apos;s proposals , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was all suggestions . none of this lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one took money to this . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , which gave suggestions for the discovered investigation .
it &apos;s not about a single peak pol@@ itic , involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to overcome this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound great pleasure , as if we could do nothing against it , but as if nothing ever changed ; it will always be rich and rich .
but when recovered optim@@ ist I see that something has started to change .
in the past few years , we have seen preview to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
this theme was found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU regist@@ ers the central regist@@ ers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties involved a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this is not the progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama re@@ vel@@ ations , this huge in@@ sight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who can be angry when other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ ting companies .
we need exec@@ u@@ tives in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; In@@ tran@@ ency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading polit@@ icians to recognize the problem and util@@ ize them by law this type of in@@ tran@@ ency .
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparent , which now enables you to end this type of tax ev@@ ac@@ up@@ tion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story as I was kid@@ n@@ apped and in the boot of a red Maz@@ um@@ an would be land@@ ed .
one day after I finished my design study , I made a rear ticket .
a type in the red springs stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just got a road@@ trip through whole country . after that he would go to peace sc@@ or@@ ps .
I invited him to beer a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep ? &quot;
he did the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleep field now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land at the boot of a Maz@@ land !
this is a small boot !
then I heard myself saying , &quot; I have one air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; ä@@ n , how please ? &quot;
at night I was in bed , I was star@@ ing at the blank@@ et and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I done to me ?
a wild as@@ le@@ ep in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out from bed to toe , at door , and I shut down my sleep .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art that he purchased from me is nowadays on his class@@ room . he &apos;s now teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view point completely .
perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends who have been waiting for ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I went to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
we make a time advantage , two years later ...
I am un@@ employed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ates pull out and the rent is increased .
I learned that it was at the time a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked up .
I think creativity can create it , fear in fun .
Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I consider something to do with it . our apartment is available for a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can sleep , wi @-@ fi and a writing desk , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on a wooden floor for 20 dollars on air mattress .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese ham @-@ ham ro@@ b tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tour with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and leave the door to the castle , Brian and me took us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and rent our rent ?
things came in ro@@ les .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether one could make it a concept .
thus we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , based on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms - the kind of rooms , whose doors you get over .
via the Internet , they can invite you to spend a wild people with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the miss@@ ile would ign@@ ite .
but indeed they do not .
no one who still is with Tro@@ st , would prefer to invest in a shop , a fore@@ igner who allows people to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned that stran@@ gers can be dangerous .
if one has a problem , one concerns the things you can do . we were able to des@@ ig@@ ate .
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the whole experience .
we had learned how to design@@ ing objects , but now we wanted to create immen@@ se confidence between people who never had ever met before .
can design work something like that ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
I want to give you a dietary sample , which degree of trust we aim .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be win@@ dy out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
I would like to un@@ lock your cell phone .
type your un@@ locked treatment of your left seat bar@@ n .
this quiet approach of pan@@ ic you can feel now -- -- is exactly what you will feel when the first time open the door .
for the only thing is what is personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can &apos;t read only your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
what does it feel , the un@@ locked treatment of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
you also feel most of the guests if they sleep elsewhere .
only because of this reason our company can exist .
just so , who is now Al Go@@ res Mobile ?
could you decl@@ are to Twitter that he can be en@@ coded for President &apos;s Office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
they now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some dis@@ cover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have imag@@ ined at first time when he would have been told when he comes , how his dog or children are hot ?
imagine you would have 150 pre@@ ju@@ ices that all say : &quot; he can really make very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you &apos;d have to subscri@@ be to your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strength@@ ens the trust .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to dis@@ close neg@@ lig@@ ations .
in the end we decided to wait until both hosts and host their coun@@ c@@ ements , before we presented it online .
last week we have discovered something new .
we have conducted an study with Stan@@ ford . we examined , how likely it is that people depend on each other , depending on how they are at age and residence .
little surpris@@ ingly , we trust people most , who are most similar .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
that is a natural social vo@@ icing .
it is exciting if you add a person to a person -- in our case by dep@@ artments .
if you have less than three reports , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything will change .
a good reputation cry out of the common@@ alities .
thus , the correct design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted prefer@@ ences .
besides , we learned that trust is depending on how much people are in@@ expensive .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you &apos;re too little tells , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; Tol@@ le art works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we make it easy to produce this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of text box to recommend the right amount of text . we also give advice to what topics you should write slightly .
our entire company builds on hope that the correct design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces from stran@@ gers .
which we didn &apos;t anticip@@ ate , the vast amount of people who were more than ready to dis@@ assem@@ ble these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredible good luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need that was not covered before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course there is times if not everything goes smooth@@ ly .
there were guests who were allowed to dev@@ ast@@ ate parties or flats .
hosts have left the rain .
at the start of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my phone .
I stood at the front front when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it is hurt if I think just about it .
the dis@@ appointment that is heard in the voice of the c@@ aller , and will always be our greatest motiv@@ ation to improve further .
fortunately for the 123 million nights , there was only a fr@@ action about a problem .
because people tru@@ sted to each other .
when trust works , Wonderful silver object can be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to the hospital .
he even ended up blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , ne@@ at through heart attack , due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real protective angels who save lives of life even though they do not know true .
you drive one in your own car to hospital when you die , wait , while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lon@@ ely , they pass books .
you can stay an even longer stay , without charge extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the clean money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
when I was proud of this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
it &apos;s about an economic trade .
but it is now just a &quot; rental industry &quot; to call , it is not justified .
Share Economy describes a trade , talking of human relationships .
people create a part of itself , and that changes everything .
when you compare nowadays it is compared to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if traveling a rich buffet of local impressions would be ?
what if you were interested in every place to visit a group there , a group there would be a thor@@ ough re@@ plen@@ ish and one in a Kne@@ ip@@ ent@@ our neighborhood , one of which has never heard of ;
or if you could cook a five star chef ?
nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would be able to create apartments from scratch ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would have to accept the common thoughts ?
I introduce myself to cities , which give us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ g@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital of Seoul , this project has already begun . many places that belonged to the government ,
there are now ro@@ omm@@ ates offered . students that were in search of a b@@ lei@@ ades ,
were medi@@ ated on people whose children were extrac@@ ted . there were incub@@ ator programs .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , alone , 785 000 people will be host in 191 countries with a stran@@ ger or even host .
so the idea seems to be so crazy as it was brought to us .
we didn &apos;t invented the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there was similar websites before us .
so why has just our work ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing , we realized that you can find the correct design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome de@@ eper pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it is amazing ,
down@@ right overwhel@@ ming .
I have to think about it , if a red Mazda is over .
we certainly know that design can &apos;t solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use this design .
thank you .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
supp@@ ressed or op@@ pressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terror@@ ist ?
or simply a del@@ ays at the airport in the airport .
that is indeed true .
I do not give you the fault for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of coverage was negative about Islam and Muslims .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
to all those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a g@@ ond@@ ary @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practice , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , for , as a baby , I was not so born .
I decided that I decided .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to take me out .
no , not as hom@@ osex@@ ual men , like some of my friends , but as Muslims ; I decided to wear the h@@ ij@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were hor@@ rified : &quot; why do you aff@@ ord yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : back then , it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independ@@ ence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt a perfect and difficult to adapt to me .
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I ger@@ m@@ ated with the cor@@ an .
I read it , thought in question , dou@@ b@@ ted and ultimately thought .
my relationship to God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow de@@ vot@@ ion which deep@@ ened with any reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to the we@@ ther .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever thought that someone can perce@@ ive you fully , and yet somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later , I married and began to know how all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; express message . &quot;
there was smoke and planes flew into buildings , people running from buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical inter@@ ference ?
my shock turned out quickly in Out@@ rage .
why should you do something like that ?
I changed the channel and heard of the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; ... , &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... , &quot; ... The bom@@ b@@ last ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bing Mek@@ ka ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only being attacked by my country but in the N@@ u , the acts of others turned away from other civil war in a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to draw into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate program .
I remember when we were silent - when we were silent - went into my seat and I was the first time fe@@ ared when Muslims are recognized .
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of national Islamic organizations , who said , &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Let not harm you . &quot;
I stayed all the week inside .
then , it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims are gathered to the bed .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the vast coverage .
the feelings felt un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held him in the outdoors and sm@@ ote .
there really was fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because people who had attacked this country , our land attacked .
I dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ate the anger of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to explain .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the acc@@ us@@ ations which are hard .
today , we actually can say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country called Muslims .
when will we go off ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we vic@@ ious or ab@@ rupt@@ ly ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and ben@@ ign tum@@ our only stops under observation .
the altern@@ atives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like any other , does not tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but an important organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ or and teachers , Aes@@ thetic and Olymp@@ ion@@ ics .
will the closure of the Americas saf@@ er to make saf@@ er ?
there may be a few parking lots , but not stop the ter@@ ror .
the regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to people with other faith a more toler@@ ant and greater citi@@ zen@@ ship .
and just like a director of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not being radi@@ cal in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cally ro@@ uted in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
during the radi@@ cal@@ isation process , one has found that he will begin the person from their church , even the person believes that the person believes that the person believes , the terror@@ ists be ab@@ h@@ ated , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or belie@@ ving .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ ization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some are still claim that Islam was a viol@@ ent religion .
finally , a group like the IS fo@@ unds their brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Muslims , as a mother , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to its imag@@ ination if you acknow@@ ledge them as a representative of 1.6 billion belie@@ vers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux cl@@ an with Christ@@ ian@@ ity .
both groups pret@@ end their ide@@ ology reasons to their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you throw a look at her , it is not pus@@ hing what they read in her &quot; Holy Script@@ ure . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets you read these things into the script@@ ures .
a exceptional Im@@ am told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they had to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radi@@ cal religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inspired by nothing and something that had given its mind , it was a major goal for the instr@@ ument@@ alization by extre@@ mist@@ s that you spoke a solution .
this Im@@ am set up the connection to God and their church .
instead of compl@@ ying for their rage , he showed her most construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept it to join the IS .
that was an in@@ sight , as the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and my family concerns me .
but how does normal Americans look like ?
how does it affect any other ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy and to our ideas ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies - show , if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept a author@@ it@@ arian government , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : when people report messages written in which negative Muslims have been reported , they voted against military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you look like the mood against Muslims , -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this took place three times , but never in connection with terror@@ ist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the Ira@@ k@@ war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction on the Muslim ter@@ ror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manip@@ ulate the public to under@@ wear the foundation of a free society that has sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel the first but toxic air of fear f@@ ails to all of us .
in the assignment of collective education , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , tal@@ ented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet , most generous person who knew her .
she visited him there , and he showed her CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did my brother become such a rever@@ sible young man ? &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , she murdered , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who came in the afternoon , as in a execution , after having post@@ pon@@ ed up against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or we stayed in at home ?
we had it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was why America we want to sur@@ render to our children : one that we would control us through fear , or one that we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we op@@ ted for the mos@@ que .
we ro@@ de with our son in the kinder@@ garten , and we went to the mos@@ que with high pressure .
I took him out , and drew my shoes , and went into the pra@@ yers , and what I looked , let me keep .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am announced an announcement , and gave to our guests welcomed because the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ the@@ ists , belie@@ vers and non @-@ belie@@ vers who had come to attack us , but about us .
at that moment , I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympath@@ y with pan@@ ic and ancest@@ ors .
what will you choose ?
what are you going to choose from fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism at the moment ?
are you sure to go on number ?
or become connected to those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a Ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what you might say that you have a TE@@ D@@ Talk that you are a mem@@ ress with dr@@ aught that are in a class@@ y thinking factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , dece@@ ive not . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so ordinary as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did so with the greatest ever guided trial to Muslims all over the world , people want ordinary things .
they want pro@@ sper@@ ity to family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no regard .
if people appear as a rule , then the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
as a platform for han@@ dic@@ raft , it is about to become a milli@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is possible in research institutions around the world .
before coming to air in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the fra@@ c Centre will be built a six @-@ meter tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ro@@ pes .
by connecting your flight devices you reach a high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
they can also build their own con@@ tribut@@ able structures .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and react to the laws in general .
today , we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight .
for a system aut@@ on@@ om , it doesn &apos;t need to know a collective compl@@ ain@@ ment , where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our labor@@ atories .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
external commands can be found on the ut@@ most layer . for example , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called tail starter ,
a flight machine that tries to hit two flies with a fl@@ ap .
as other Star@@ r@@ fle@@ ers , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most star @-@ fle@@ ers , it can float , and has a great advantage for start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping side .
restri@@ ction of hed@@ ge@@ vity is that they react sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea is , that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which position is reg@@ ained and improved performance by practic@@ ing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that go forward to the core of the cause .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ icop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts that can claim to injury .
before decades , pilots couldn &apos;t fly remote controlled flying tools , which had only two moving parts : a propeller and a rear end .
we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est remote machine . it was invented a short time ago .
it only has a moving part , a propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross rec@@ orders , no further actuators or control surfaces , just a propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the inner life so much , so it can be stable and moving in space .
however , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to a fly , I have to perfectly cast it right .
the lik@@ el@@ i@@ hood of dis@@ card it , if all look like me , is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed next night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in sweet@@ ness , this machine is here , the Om@@ bud@@ op@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , a practice in excess .
what do we do with all this cash flow ?
they see that he is both symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is equivalent in his alignment .
thus he receives the great skill ,
in space to move in all directions , no matter which he rot@@ ates , or even how he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight pro@@ p .
some things are available in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us see that .
when flying machines have to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate b@@ ang@@ ers flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise .
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
if you build them together , they act like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong - a motor or propeller falling off , the electronics or a battery -- can also fly the machine if con@@ stra@@ ined .
we will now demonstr@@ ate that by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic sw@@ ans .
the large number of autonomous , coordin@@ ated units enables an aesthetic expression .
we took custom@@ ary micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and mo@@ cks them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit white where in the room they are and is self @-@ controlled . this is why there is no limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstr@@ ations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine since Broadway becomes a flying lamp@@ shade .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wage is in development and your creative activity .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows tri@@ po@@ ds heads to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economical potential , is the bag on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago in a very far dist@@ ant galax@@ y two black holes are getting faster , they turned into pure energy in a ten@@ se knowledge of pure energy .
for a short moment , they illumin@@ ated brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big Kn@@ all .
but they put your energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time pl@@ ains and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation .
arrange the events first .
1.3 billion years ago , there was just a more serious life on Earth .
since then the Earth has high@@ lighted a lot : cor@@ als , Pis@@ ces , plants , din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , people , and -- God understand us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of more Mu@@ eller -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector to build a huge laser detector , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most they held them for crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ric gra@@ vit@@ ational Observ@@ atory .
in the following time , the precision of Lig@@ o significantly increased , what the detection rate improved trem@@ end@@ ous .
therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run around several smaller and st@@ ub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ectors , the gra@@ vit@@ ational sle@@ epers of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes caused by the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional when they :
the Birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well of my to@@ d@@ father &apos;s father .
basically , this was the fruits of my life .
all this , for I had worked , is not longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colle@@ ague Scott Hug@@ hes , the theoretical Physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been research@@ ed as Lig@@ o meas@@ ur@@ able signals for 23 years and their by ob@@ serv@@ atory signals like lig@@ o meas@@ ur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational change is a mouse in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its total content will be stretched out into a direction and st@@ olen in the other direction .
to illustr@@ ate lec@@ tur@@ ers lead in courses for the Rel@@ ativity Theory , often a correct dance .
&quot; Stretch and dust , stret@@ ches and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gravity sw@@ elling are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on 14 September , for example , everybody was stretched out of the waves of the waves and the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human life was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . this was the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re long laser detector , and that &apos;s already ab@@ sur@@ d , this length must be measured precisely in less than a thousand grain of a nuclear nuclear . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
described K@@ ip Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt after the waves follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in construction of such det@@ ectors are trem@@ end@@ ous .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are in@@ ven@@ tive and with the support of the public there will be all obst@@ acles to be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . scott likes to say , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us : face @-@ like , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite handy . because you can take a picture or card of things by ens@@ uring that of several points coming around you .
it is different with tones .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean much of you :
about the face of your child .
instead , we lau@@ gh at specific properties like sound position and pitch , rhythm and volume to highlight the story .
&quot; now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks her . &quot;
&quot; watch Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ation tables .
we can make no easy pictures of objects in all @-@ in with them .
but by foc@@ using on changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least the measured frequencies are located for Lig@@ o .
so when we convert the pattern in Sh@@ all , we can literally listen to all literally .
to lau@@ gh , you can bet@@ ray us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colle@@ ague Scott has already been very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn on the two bodies very quickly , it sounds the same cir@@ cul@@ ations with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a type of movement , stamped in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget , heard this sound like the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with a 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turns around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let us over@@ take what it means .
two black holes , the most den@@ sely body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 sun , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we &apos;ve heard it .
there is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is a completely new way to study the universe as never before .
on this road we can listen to all the noise and the visible .
we can &apos;t see much in the space -- practical or generally -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ e@@ iche stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about that .
the thr@@ illing physical processes are done at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and sil@@ icon .
we will never pass through , since these op@@ aque are .
gravity flow through iron when it would be transparent glass . the ur@@ b@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see since it is covered by its own offspring .
from fri@@ vit@@ ational tables it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and probably the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen and of whom we have never seen and of whom we do not see . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o was just right in the first attempt , which we did not expect .
my colle@@ ague alongside the MIT , Matt Evans , is an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says concerning this topic : me : the type of stars which show black holes are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are s@@ cour@@ ing for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o makes us an entirely different view to the events in All , on the emer@@ gence of stars and ultimately , as we emerged from this may@@ hem .
AA : the challenge now consists to be bra@@ ve as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to find great det@@ ectors and the rob@@ ber@@ y and the trop@@ es of the universe .
we need ideas for new ob@@ serv@@ atory -- a completely new generation of Observ@@ atory on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than the ur@@ ist@@ le of all things ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried a experiment .
for one year I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of that .
no matter whether she made me ner@@ vous that in un@@ pleasant situations I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
do I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
do I want to start playing with the spect@@ acle ?
no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fe@@ ared , elim@@ inated my fear .
my fear , talking to keeping my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; Yes &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; Yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life changed , un@@ exp@@ ec@@ tedly . it began with a question of my min@@ ds .
I have three un@@ belie@@ vable daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the Sm@@ allest , calls all the &apos; accounts , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; I don &apos;t need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her , when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this time yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I still s@@ wear to play with them as soon as you do , or wher@@ ever I go , I am always saying yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I stri@@ ve to make myself very much .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our families .
but it also has a dis@@ concer@@ ting side effect : only recently I understood the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ s@@ agen to play my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think , simply aw@@ ake to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I am TV .
I do not make TV really big .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for it to carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs , which did not exist .
the budget for a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new ep@@ isode every nine days ago shows four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million US TV , four broad@@ casts that are in production at the same time : 24 ep@@ iso@@ des : sc@@ andal , 15 ep@@ iso@@ des : sc@@ andal , 15 ep@@ iso@@ des : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 ep@@ iso@@ des : the C@@ atch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows running on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions will be available in 67 languages for 30 million vie@@ wers .
my brain is global , and 45 of this 70 TV @-@ hour are ship@@ ments that I have created myself , and not only produced , so I have time to gather , creative time to gather my fans of camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV shows , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fi@@ res that burn around the world .
do you know who still does that ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you all of you who work with so hard if you &apos;re a company , a country or a class@@ room , so you understand that I am not only interested in the computer , and it &apos;s right when I say : I understand that there is not a dream of dream dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I &apos;m working much , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work still creates a land from nothing .
it is , when I set up troops , I climbed up on a canvas .
so as dre@@ aming , one of the most clay , a marathon .
one feels like Bey@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechanical , str@@ en@@ uous , and in@@ spir@@ ing , clin@@ ically and mater@@ nal , clin@@ ically and r@@ app@@ y . and the best to it is the s@@ ums .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a s@@ ums start in my head , and it grows and grows , and the s@@ ums rose like a busy road , I could go for ever .
many people take in when I decl@@ are these s@@ ums that I write about writing that writing me joy .
do not understand me wrong , that does .
but the s@@ ums -- when I began to work and work with the TV production started to work and work , I discovered this thing , this s@@ ums , this energy .
the s@@ ums is more than writing .
the s@@ ums is action and activity . the s@@ ums is a drug .
the s@@ ums is music . the s@@ ums is light and air .
the s@@ ums is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a s@@ ums , then you can not stri@@ ve differ@@ ently than size .
the feeling that can not be different than size , no matter what price .
it is called the s@@ ums .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s your ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I did not fail for failure , and I only know that I love the s@@ ums .
I want to tell you only , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it into question .
to make a clear answer : every successful I will get more than ever more broad@@ casts , the more more sound , the more things happening at the same time , the more things are going longer , the more so I &apos;m doing history , more than expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work .
and what about work ?
I love work , right ?
the land , which I car@@ af@@ e , the marathon , whom I run , the army that s@@ ums , the s@@ ums , the s@@ ums , the s@@ ums and s@@ ums .
I like this s@@ ums . I love the s@@ ums .
I need the s@@ ums . I am the s@@ ums .
am I only this s@@ ums ?
and then the s@@ ums stops .
revised , over@@ load , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burnt out .
the s@@ ums stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; that I would like to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
it is the children of a TI@@ TAN@@ EN .
they are Baby @-@ TI@@ TAN@@ EN .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the s@@ ums stopped .
the s@@ ums of the engine stopped .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the s@@ ums did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same thing as always : the same TI@@ TAN@@ EN work , 15 hours @-@ days , abor@@ ated weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , no re@@ mor@@ se , not deleg@@ ates , but with all heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no s@@ ums .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an indication Titan ,
everything was grey , I simply had no more fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the s@@ ums and the s@@ ums .
so what do you do when doing what you do , the work which one loves , suddenly ?
I know , some people think : &quot; He@@ ul you , the writer Titan . &quot;
but you know , you do it , one loves to be a teacher of being a ban@@ ker , a painter , Bill Gates wher@@ ever you feel , and knows how the s@@ ums feel when trying to stop the s@@ ums even if the s@@ ums stops , who is one ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song sounds of my heart , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
I am on the way back , late , and she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you play ? &quot;
and I will tell no more than two things to be aware of :
first@@ ly , I have to say Yes to everything and secon@@ dly , she called me not .
it doesn &apos;t call no more &quot; estimate . &quot;
when did it happen ?
I hate it when I de@@ pressed Titan &apos;s and my s@@ ums , and it changes everything in front of my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
we play and their sisters down , we lau@@ gh a lot and read at the book &quot; Every@@ body P@@ oo@@ ps . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude , and in the absence of Sum@@ é@@ mens , I can do nothing but to be mounted .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land , which I car@@ af@@ e , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists , stick@@ y fingers and dam@@ p , tender voices , wax cra@@ yons and song , where it is sl@@ ump , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I bre@@ athe .
play is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me is dis@@ sol@@ ving .
a mental door goes on and a burst slide comes in .
and this is not right now , but it happens .
I feel it .
the s@@ ums are slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the s@@ ums but a s@@ ums .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s remain with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the s@@ ums , the working ums , which is titanium , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you , if I tell you who I am , if I describe my brain using video and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I for@@ got what the real s@@ ums are .
the s@@ ums is no power and it is not un@@ employed .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real s@@ ums is dependent upon love .
the s@@ ums is the electricity that comes from the living .
the real s@@ ums is self @-@ awareness and peace .
real Sum@@ men ign@@ ore the pressure of history , which reflect on complete tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
genuine s@@ ums is simple and original .
the real s@@ ums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , because God said to me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
when my child will play with me I will say Yes .
I do this to be sure that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of all gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the s@@ ums .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing , I don &apos;t play that way as working .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I am still working because I love it .
I prefer to be at the workplace as home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , because what a man rather works to be at home ?
well , I .
to be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan .
I need to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
we s@@ la@@ wn around in the garden , before and back , and her .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst out bub@@ ble .
in doing so I pre@@ domin@@ antly feel st@@ iff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always gre@@ t@@ men after my cell .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the s@@ ums of the universe met me .
I play and play , till I wonder ? why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can say it too ! do you always say Yes , if your child would like to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ive , for a day@@ trip .
there you have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you also know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug fixes me or coo@@ kie .
and speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , no longer need it .
everyone can get 15 minutes before , even on a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no deposit .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my comfort , my world . there is no need to be the children . it is considered to have a place for his mind @-@ peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
to play the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m che@@ er@@ able and I will take care of friends , books that day --
&quot; you want to play ? &quot; it is short for everything that I got up when I was my first TV show when I was a Titan at the training , when I wanted to make me more and more .
15 minutes on the piece , why not allow full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the s@@ ums got back in my spare time . the s@@ ums seems to return soon when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without any games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it fills me and my soul . I love it again and my soul . I will use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the s@@ ums , but I love it not .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the s@@ ums , the s@@ ums are not mine ... no more .
bub@@ ble fingers and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends .
now this is my hum@@ ming .
the s@@ ums of life .
the s@@ ums of love .
the s@@ ums of labour is part of me , but only a part . and so I am so gr@@ ateful .
it is schn@@ u@@ ppe that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan before going to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my fi@@ res still burn .
the more I am , the happ@@ ier I and my kids .
the more I &apos;m playing , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I plays , the more cle@@ arer is my head .
the more I plays , the better I work .
the more I plays , the more I hear the s@@ ums . the land , which I car@@ af@@ e , the marathon , whom I drive , the s@@ ums , the s@@ ums , the s@@ ums , the s@@ ums , the other , the s@@ ums of life : the s@@ ums of life .
the more I feel like this s@@ ums , the more makes this unusual , stunning , naked and new life experience in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this s@@ ums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think of things , I aw@@ ake you to life .
that belongs to the job , this means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ am@@ eless .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play .
we don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am a neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from a second to the other , after a heavy stroke or car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ help .
after serious injury of the central ner@@ vous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy dis@@ ability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve your ner@@ vous functions through various surgical measures .
certainly , they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; low@@ job @-@ stim@@ ulation &quot; and im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to manip@@ ulate the circuits of ne@@ ur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson &apos;s dest@@ iny , causing severe cit@@ rus and severe pain@@ s .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation is not means Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional Neuro@@ surgery is the restore of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was an executive director and a day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with brain trau@@ ma @-@ trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that with brain trau@@ ma @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a bra@@ we@@ ary the brain and the sk@@ ull pressure rises .
to save life , one must reduce the sk@@ ull pressure .
but one must sometimes remove a proportion of sw@@ ol@@ len she@@ pher@@ ds .
rather than using the sw@@ ol@@ len she@@ ds of she@@ ds , we decided to analy@@ ze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues to analy@@ ze a biolog@@ ist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
the cells of a tissue is comparable with very small children that can be taken out of your families .
you have to find the proper nutrition , temperature , moisture and environments to de@@ fle@@ ct them .
we had to do that with these cells .
after many attemp@@ ts it was Jean François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ri@@ pe cells .
maybe you are still knowledge of the Biology class that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform themselves in every cell type of organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has tri@@ c@@ els , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nich@@ es from the brain .
it is surprising that type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP was preserved .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they split slowly , and after a few weeks it died even .
so we saw a new , strange chemical population , which looked like stem cells but was different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells emer@@ ge dou@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ um cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us it car@@ es for the development of the brain .
why are they supposed to receive us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that in the healing of the brain , since we found them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain in@@ jur@@ ies .
but that is not so certain .
however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , allowing the brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain in the non @-@ language area and then ac@@ ulate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they then lab@@ eled in color to track them in the brain .
in the last step we planted it at the decision of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ splant@@ ation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splant@@ ation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ ate the same cells in your brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we observed the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely taken away , they go back home . the room is already filled , they will not be needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added a viol@@ ation to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now they stopped the cells , -- it grew to mature ne@@ ur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show , are these small points . these are the cells that we in vitro , in vitro .
here we could not stop .
can these cells also help a mon@@ key to recover from a brain injury ?
so we exerc@@ ised monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take cover pellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
when they achieved a stable skill level , we passed the motor motor@@ ized cor@@ tex into the motor motor@@ ized field .
thus the monkeys were pul@@ mon@@ ed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen with people , they thr@@ illed spont@@ aneously until a certain degree , just like a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover plastic brain mechanisms . recover from a certain degree , just like the mon@@ key .
when we were sure , the aff@@ air had reached his degree of the spont@@ aneous recovery , we planted it in its own cells .
on the left , they see the mon@@ key who re@@ stra@@ ined spont@@ aneously .
it can take about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not as accurate and not as fast .
now , as we im@@ planted the cells : the same mon@@ key , two months after re@@ im@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that &apos;s very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found very much more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze and use later .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ olog@@ ic models , for example in Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plants the human being .
I really hope that as soon as we can show you how the human brain is the means to he@@ al himself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , just now , several do@@ zen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone you might need . &quot;
I definitely fall .
of course , the question of what the biggest obst@@ acles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obst@@ acles are the authorities . consider@@ ing these great results you have to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
BG : this is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ately , etc .
J@@ B : Yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- You have completed research and trying to get permission to start clinical trials like many years , until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose patients to do and evalu@@ ate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
one must first say that it is useful before taking this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s sure . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us of it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake , to consider it as of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant which it is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as a variable hab@@ it .
we believe that capitalism is in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably leads toward democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w from Singapore and his big he@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing certainly proved that it is possible to have an flo@@ wering capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy stays completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy appears in us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government - was un@@ miss@@ able to me as the Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- not the Spar@@ es would have to be realised in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there might be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w or the Communist Party of China , or some of my compet@@ ent friends who had said to me if democracy would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economical model for a real democracy .
I call you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
because without democracy , our companies will become mixed , our future glo@@ om@@ y and great , new technologies .
for waste , I would like to point to an interesting cont@@ radi@@ ction which currently end@@ ang@@ ered our hosts .
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox &quot; .
one pe@@ aks is known to you . they know and recognize it as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
yet few see his twin y@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be an@@ x@@ ious to invest it , however , to invest it , where it would be productive and earnings , with which one needs to produce the debt , which is urg@@ ently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the US , in England and in the Eurozone , in all the pro@@ sper@@ ity producers , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on .
3.4 billion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.1 tr@@ illion US dollars , that at the same time in those countries and our financial instit@@ utes accum@@ ulated , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange rates and the property prices .
so deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital are the twin wheels , which are not al@@ igned through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is st@@ agn@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds within the US , Japan and Europe un@@ employed , and consequently there is a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which it could not invest it . exactly like Ö@@ edi@@ pus Father , who could not be true that his son would kill him if he will grow .
un@@ certain circumstances bring down the circumstances caused by him that o@@ pus will kill him .
this is my H@@ ade@@ my with capitalism --
his very extra@@ vag@@ ant Art. All the un@@ productive capital should be used to develop our lives , developing human tal@@ ents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are decisive for the rescue of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I think , but before we proceed : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the company form , in which the free and poor as a majority can control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was of course too many of --
women , fore@@ ign@@ ers , and of course sl@@ aves .
however , it would be an error to decrease the job of ath@@ ic democracy because of these incl@@ usions .
making the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy and it is that she gave the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which granted them the right to political comp@@ ilation with equal vote weigh@@ ting in questions of state bel@@ ass@@ ing .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy have not kept long .
like a candle , which sh@@ ines brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , our today liberal democr@@ ac@@ ies have not roots their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the Gl@@ or@@ ious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while ath@@ ic democracy grew on the free citizens focused and the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling .
for liberal democracy first came to see when a full separation of politics and economy was fe@@ ed@@ ited and the democratic process was im@@ bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy was the world of corpor@@ ations - a democracy @-@ free zone .
our present democr@@ ac@@ ies have been held since the date of which this break@@ down from politics and the economy began , an inher@@ ited struggle between the two , where the economy is gradually mig@@ rated and fore@@ ign@@ ited .
do you wish , why the polit@@ icians do not like the work ?
it is not part of a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is about that people can be nowadays in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics is revol@@ ted and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my had@@ n with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in such a way like a herd of roug@@ h@@ ness , the animals that it fe@@ eds on , dec@@ im@@ ated , dec@@ im@@ ated by the end .
similarly , it is concerned with the economy that the politics is so far knew that it grows through the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself . political goods are de@@ emed to exp@@ ire the economic demand , and the general level of corpor@@ ations are de@@ pri@@ ved to invest in the company &apos;s cash .
the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; distri@@ b@@ utes from the democracy , the higher the twin wheels , and the greater the waste of human labour force and the wealth of hum@@ ank@@ ind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had already done this idea over 100 years ago and it was not particularly easy .
the doctrine of the de@@ ac@@ ity of the Soviet Union should be , that the workers are only revi@@ ved by a mir@@ acle , as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism is doing it by re@@ placing low wage employees by automation and robot .
the problem is , so long economy and politics can be higher , the automation around the twin wheels are higher , the waste dump content , and the social conflic@@ ts lower , as soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so , we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ mind the areas of economy and politics , and respect that we would like to re@@ ate the restored area , otherwise , in a disease @-@ descri@@ bing Hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy , which leaves the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
thus , the question is not whether capitalism has brought up technical achie@@ vements he will survive .
the interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a thr@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix &quot; , or by something that the society in &quot; Star Trek &quot; is similar to humans and in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long con@@ vers@@ ations to the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what br@@ illi@@ es it so , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; or similar u@@ top@@ ia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; similar di@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation , i want to give you some examples of course shortly .
in the field of companies : please make a capital market prior to which you have generated money while you work and in which your capital is coming to you from a firm to the next , and the company - no matter what is currently working - is the property of which currently work in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no difference between those who work the company , but do not work in it , and employee who work there , but no more diving between capital and labor , no big g@@ aps between investment and s@@ ars , and ultimately no sens@@ oral twin wheels .
in the field of global political economy , please introduce that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government pays the sum , representing the trade defic@@ it or the mer@@ chand@@ ising of the country in a common fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment equ@@ als are r@@ ar .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had been proposed in the Woo@@ ds Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that you didn &apos;t had to implement the technical resources right then .
today , we , in particular , in front of the background of a re@@ united policy and business .
the world , which I describe them is the same time , becoming more privileg@@ ed and Marx@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and ger@@ yn@@ es@@ ians , global ger@@ yn@@ es@@ ians .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we watch in such a world
or will we drop in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer will depend on how we are polit@@ ically decide .
it is in our hands , and we are doing it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography himself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ un@@ ification of politics and business is ... doing that the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand what Lar@@ ry S@@ umm@@ ers are called &quot; long @-@ term st@@ ub@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it is not only our democr@@ ac@@ ies dest@@ abil@@ izing , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal .
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is quite relevant .
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes is , and therefore I &apos;m entirely conf@@ used .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not working , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said it . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you keep from the view@@ point of the West in China .
would you repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hyp@@ oc@@ ris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ ac@@ ies we have a note of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , during the area where the most of the economy is playing - a whol@@ ly imper@@ ial zone .
in a certain extent , if I may say the prov@@ oc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century .
for -- do you re@@ mind -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy - this is an error , histor@@ ically informative .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly sc@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can now observe in China , similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to second .
China pres@@ ume to do that which has done the West in the 19th century , sm@@ ells huge after hyp@@ oc@@ ris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious to your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that it comes .
BG : Yes ...
how do you return six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to get a new beginning with the euro@@ zone .
not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone ,
namely us to say goo@@ db@@ ye , and to per@@ su@@ al den@@ ial that a massive rise in the Eurozone fell as@@ le@@ ep and continues to keep the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity to lay on the basis of Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion was to reveal &#91; them &#93; .
unfortunately it was right . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone would continue to den@@ y the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to obtain an economic system , which is not vi@@ able to obtain through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , but if the change occurs , it occurs ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistake in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example , Y@@ V : everybody who looks back - Harvest juice ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims not a mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the money am@@ pler , to find a joint solution .
but this did not exist .
they just wanted to bring to our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the promises , which went through the Eurozone .
they refused to ad@@ mit that they have been a cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during &quot; Great De@@ pression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the money raised to us , st@@ acked : &quot; that was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all this , despite the aggressive wa@@ ist of talks , you seem to be quite a European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro area comes from som@@ eb@@ ody , who lives and loves .
my major fear is that the euro zone is not survived .
because when it does not survive the released cre@@ eps will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have consequences for Europe cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ic consequences , but for the global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we propos@@ e ourselves to the way of a post@@ war in 1930 , after which it appears , it will also be as dre@@ aming for the future of Europeans like the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you very much that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
Roy Price never heard that , although he probably never heard for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision , Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible to produce the shows and content of the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fought branch .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he needs to find shows that are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that turn right on this turn .
this curve is the rating map of more than 2500 TV series on the site . the review shows 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this rating .
will evalu@@ ate your show with nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , wh@@ en@@ ever you have a season , your brain is asking : &quot; where are there any more of these ep@@ iso@@ des ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ d@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of turn .
Roy Price does not stand on the left side of the turn , because I think you need particular intelligence to under@@ go &quot; To@@ d@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he is more thoughts about the average explo@@ itation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they don &apos;t am@@ aze you .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something , therefore Roy Price wants to risk no .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so it keeps a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produced the first ep@@ isode of each of these shows and displays them online where they can watch free .
and if Amazon does not answer your stuff , one gets too , right ?
millions of vie@@ wers take this ep@@ iso@@ des .
however , they do not know that they are watching the shows .
by Roy and his team , they are watching everything .
you may capture when you start the show , when one makes a p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts to jump and look again .
you collect millions of data to make sure what show they should produce .
in fact , they process the data , process these and resulting from the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did that show .
does any@@ body know the name of this show ?
Yes , &quot; Alpha House &quot; but it seems that not many of this show cannot be remin@@ ded because they were not so good .
it is only a medi@@ an show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House has land@@ ed at 7.5 -- i.e. something above the average , but not exactly what does Roy and his team worked .
at the same time with another company , another manager has been placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly as Roy is always searching to find this one super show and he does not use data for it , but he makes it somewhat different .
instead of a competition , he and his team have viewed the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews given to the shows whose shows they like them like etc .
they then use these data to find out these small details about the audience : which shows they like producer , which actors .
when they had all the parts , they entered a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com on four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about an ator .
do you know this show ?
Yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has land@@ ed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this bend . so exactly there where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very expert , data ver@@ ified companies .
they combine these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic had somehow dar@@ ed that all should work with everything .
if one collec@@ ts millions of data , for a decision which is going to meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have a back @-@ up for 200 years .
you are optim@@ ised by very powerful computer .
the min@@ de@@ thing you can expect is good TV , right ?
if data analysis did not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in time , in which we learn more and more about statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room comes in contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is staying in the prison and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person is good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
it is not always the best results . that &apos;s not about that a company does not know how multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data ver@@ nis@@ hing firms are also wrong .
Yes , even Google does sometimes make mist@@ akes .
2009 , Google announced that they can pre@@ di@@ ct through data analysis out@@ breaks of fl@@ u , the worse way -- through data analysis of the Google @-@ Records .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news coverage . the success was created in a publication in Nature &apos;s magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just year round , year , until it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sens@@ ation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data ver@@ ify firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flow from life to life a -- at work , in case of law through medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many trouble with data . I work in the computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imag@@ in@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized a few patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be diss@@ emin@@ ated .
if you need to solve a more complex problem , do mainly do two things :
as a first cut this problem in its parts so you can analy@@ ze the single parts ; as second place , put the parts together to get a decision .
sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and place again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just fine for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to assem@@ ble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assem@@ ble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
when there &apos;s something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again to summar@@ ize , even if the information is in@@ complete then , if the brain is of an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x as successful as they have used data and mind , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand the audience , why they otherwise did not have been able to re@@ comp@@ ile all these parts , and resulting from a show as &quot; House of Cards . &quot; this is not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant she entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were looking for TV ideas , then select &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better cho@@ ices , but I think things are going wrong to control our decisions .
no matter how power@@ fully they are , data is just a tool , and to forget that is rather useful .
many of you will be ...
before it was written , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question , you only need to shake the ball to get a reply . &quot; most probably &quot; -- right here in this moment .
later , I will come up with a technical demo demo .
so far I have met some decisions in my life so far I should listen to the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have available the data , you would like to replace them with something much ow@@ ing it , like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball l@@ ush and lon@@ er and lon@@ er . ultimately , it is about us to make decisions , if we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encour@@ aging message that despite the great amount of data still paying off , cho@@ ices to meet , an expert in what you do , and risks .
for at the end , there are not the data but the risks , which you land at the right end of the turn .
thank you beautiful .
