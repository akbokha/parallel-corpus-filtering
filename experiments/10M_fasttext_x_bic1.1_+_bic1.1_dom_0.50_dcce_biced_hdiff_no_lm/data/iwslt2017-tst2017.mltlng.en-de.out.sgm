<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times Award.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before ever somebody played by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published his NSA illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is a different chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In it, he describes a catastrophic US economies, where the CIA handed down his drafts to atomic bomb for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you may read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know, whom the chapter doesn't work at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government of Risen has determined and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, Whistleblower to condemn and pointed out journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constituents, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media cannot get this information, and if they cannot be able to protect their identity.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, when the government came back to Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter did so: he refuses and said he would go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen has lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something unusual is happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though they say that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failures and crises to express ideas, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigation, without his consent, his phone number might be worried,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, his loan agreement, and even travelers with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that she used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA-Whistleblowers and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has convicted more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government had agreed too much from their work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost any article about national security had been the result of that a Whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the initial constituents, because the government has more ways to scorate all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like technology of the Government permits the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies in order to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, communication software which has not yet been written as Risen has written, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed from the Internet most famous, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I am working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can send documents to documents or information, as in each common contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only has access to the current news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot afford more information about it, and many of the information that they would require it would not be available from curtain.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments over the world are always developing new spy technologies that all endanger us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is safe to ensure that not only technology companies such as Edward Snowden have a chance to apply misfortune. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The harvesting of soldiers in the supply of soldiers severely white and of overfilled hospitals reports. or the next environmental worker, the alarm goes down to seize water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warned us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">At least, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crime but to protect us all the constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest databck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that kingdoms of money was hidden in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to make a statement.] This week we were sent by news about a runtangle of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Moscatca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca, and say: "well, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of news, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad uranium companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin will lead about a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, the nervous place to wait for the next release and to the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">The plot sounds like the plot of a coach or John-Grisham-Romans.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems awkways from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty in the location are to hide their assets in tax havases, and not all of their taxes pay for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens of some a few, can be hiding and deteriorated - something that we have been discussing and unveiled for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will make this whole world very confusing, and it's difficult to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind those prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult to understand punishments and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no enough Americans that you may hide in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by this principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosel Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We could have a datleman from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to specify a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the U.S. has allowed it to carry out schoolhomes, students.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to zoom off, particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator at the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave herself to an African minister, who wanted to bring down money to the USA to buy a house of a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us, that all heads made to our investigator's proposals, how he could transfer his money. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">This was all suggestions. none of this lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one took money to this. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, which gave suggestions for the discovered investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single peak politic, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound great pleasure, as if we could do nothing against it, but as if nothing ever changed; it will always be rich and rich.</seg>
<seg id="84">But when recovered optimist I see that something has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen preview to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">This theme was found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers the central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties involved a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this is not the progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who can be angry when other people can hide their true identity behind spotting companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy that stand up and say: "Intranency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians to recognize the problem and utilize them by law this type of intranency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparent, which now enables you to end this type of tax evacuption, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I was kidnapped and in the boot of a red Mazuman would be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design study, I made a rear ticket.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red springs stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just got a roadtrip through whole country. after that he would go to peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to beer a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He did the whole thing even worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleep field now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land at the boot of a Mazland!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying, "I have one air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "än, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I was staring at the blanket and thought: "Oh man! what have I done to me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild asleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out from bed to toe, at door, and I shut down my sleep.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he purchased from me is nowadays on his classroom. he's now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my view point completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who have been waiting for?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I went to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a time advantage, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates pull out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that it was at the time a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked up.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">Brian Chesky wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I consider something to do with it. our apartment is available for a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can sleep, wi-fi and a writing desk, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on a wooden floor for 20 dollars on air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese ham-ham rob tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We tour with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and leave the door to the castle, Brian and me took us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and rent our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether one could make it a concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented ourselves to the investors: "we would like to create a website, based on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the kind of rooms, whose doors you get over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can invite you to spend a wild people with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who still is with Trost, would prefer to invest in a shop, a foreigner who allows people to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned that strangers can be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one concerns the things you can do. we were able to desigate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and haptics -- it is the whole experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designing objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who never had ever met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design work something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a dietary sample, which degree of trust we aim.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be windy out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">I would like to unlock your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked treatment of your left seat barn.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic you can feel now -- -- is exactly what you will feel when the first time open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing is what is personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can't read only your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">What does it feel, the unlocked treatment of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">You also feel most of the guests if they sleep elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only because of this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who is now Al Gores Mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare to Twitter that he can be encoded for President's Office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have imagined at first time when he would have been told when he comes, how his dog or children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 prejuices that all say: "he can really make very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you'd have to subscribe to your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to disclose negligations.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end we decided to wait until both hosts and host their councements, before we presented it online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted an study with Stanford. we examined, how likely it is that people depend on each other, depending on how they are at age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust people most, who are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">That is a natural social voicing.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add a person to a person -- in our case by departments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three reports, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything will change.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation cry out of the commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">Thus, the correct design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Besides, we learned that trust is depending on how much people are inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you're too little tells, such as "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle art works in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we make it easy to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of text box to recommend the right amount of text. we also give advice to what topics you should write slightly.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the correct design can help to overcome our prejudices from strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">Which we didn't anticipate, the vast amount of people who were more than ready to disassemble these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there is times if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were allowed to devastate parties or flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the start of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it is hurt if I think just about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that is heard in the voice of the caller, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately for the 123 million nights, there was only a fraction about a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, Wonderful silver object can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended up blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, neat through heart attack, due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protective angels who save lives of life even though they do not know true.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to hospital when you die, wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay an even longer stay, without charge extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the clean money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I was proud of this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it is now just a "rental industry" to call, it is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, talking of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People create a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you compare nowadays it is compared to Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if traveling a rich buffet of local impressions would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if you were interested in every place to visit a group there, a group there would be a thorough replenish and one in a Kneipentour neighborhood, one of which has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would be able to create apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have to accept the common thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="238">I introduce myself to cities, which give us society and relations, instead of loneliness and degation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital of Seoul, this project has already begun. many places that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">There are now roommates offered. students that were in search of a bleiades,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated on people whose children were extracted. there were incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, alone, 785 000 people will be host in 191 countries with a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There was similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the correct design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeper prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it is amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, if a red Mazda is over.</seg>
<seg id="253">We certainly know that design can't solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use this design.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Suppressed or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delays at the airport in the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">That is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of coverage was negative about Islam and Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">To all those who have never met a Muslims: it's great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A gondary-Fitness-fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practice, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, for, as a baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided that I decided.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to take me out.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual men, like some of my friends, but as Muslims; I decided to wear the hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you afford yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: back then, it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, which I felt as 17-year-old felt a perfect and difficult to adapt to me.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I germated with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought in question, doubted and ultimately thought.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion which deepened with any reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik sometimes brings me to the wether.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever thought that someone can perceive you fully, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later, I married and began to know how all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "express message."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke and planes flew into buildings, people running from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical interference?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned out quickly in Outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the channel and heard of the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"..., "... in the name of Islam..."... "..."..., "... The bomblast..."... "bombing Mekka!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only being attacked by my country but in the Nu, the acts of others turned away from other civil war in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to draw into a new city and start with the postgraduate program.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember when we were silent - when we were silent - went into my seat and I was the first time feared when Muslims are recognized.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw and read the warnings of national Islamic organizations, who said, "Be vigilant," "Be careful," "Let not harm you."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed all the week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then, it was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims are gathered to the bed.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the vast coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings felt unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who held him in the outdoors and smote.</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country, our land attacked.</seg>
<seg id="315">I discriminate the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we actually can say people: "there is a problem in this country called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go off? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we vicious or abruptly?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and benign tumour only stops under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like any other, does not tumour in the body of the USA, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, Aesthetic and Olympionics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of the Americas safer to make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking lots, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit to a mosque leads to people with other faith a more tolerant and greater citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="333">And just like a director of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not being radical in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radically routed in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalisation process, one has found that he will begin the person from their church, even the person believes that the person believes that the person believes, the terrorists be abhated, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or believing.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam was a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS founds their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to its imagination if you acknowledge them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups pretend their ideology reasons to their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you throw a look at her, it is not pushing what they read in her "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets you read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A exceptional Imam told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they had to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had given its mind, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that you spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set up the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of complying for their rage, he showed her most constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, as the Islamophobia and my family concerns me.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does normal Americans look like?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy and to our ideas?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscience studies - show, if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept a authoritarian government, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when people report messages written in which negative Muslims have been reported, they voted against military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look like the mood against Muslims, -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this took place three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Irakwar and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction on the Muslim terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to underwear the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel the first but toxic air of fear fails to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective education, it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most sweet, most generous person who knew her.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did my brother become such a reversible young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after visiting Suzanne at her brother and his wife, she murdered, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who came in the afternoon, as in a execution, after having postponed up against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or we stayed in at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We had it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was why America we want to surrender to our children: one that we would control us through fear, or one that we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We rode with our son in the kindergarten, and we went to the mosque with high pressure.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and drew my shoes, and went into the prayers, and what I looked, let me keep.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam announced an announcement, and gave to our guests welcomed because the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to attack us, but about us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment, I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and sympathy with panic and ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you going to choose from fear and fanaticism at the moment?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you sure to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or become connected to those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a Nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you might say that you have a TEDTalk that you are a memress with draught that are in a classy thinking factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, deceive not. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did so with the greatest ever guided trial to Muslims all over the world, people want ordinary things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no regard.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, then the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">As a platform for handicraft, it is about to become a milliard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before coming to air in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the frac Centre will be built a six-meter tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting your flight devices you reach a high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build their own contributable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turmoil and react to the laws in general.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">For a system autonom, it doesn't need to know a collective complainment, where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new location technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands can be found on the utmost layer. for example, "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called tail starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">As other Starrfleers, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most star-fleers, it can float, and has a great advantage for start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">Restriction of hedgevity is that they react sensitive to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea is, that the flight device doesn't matter in which position is regained and improved performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that go forward to the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts that can claim to injury.</seg>
<seg id="434">Before decades, pilots couldn't fly remote controlled flying tools, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear end.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote machine. it was invented a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross recorders, no further actuators or control surfaces, just a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, in the inner life so much, so it can be stable and moving in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to a fly, I have to perfectly cast it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of discard it, if all look like me, is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed next night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is a practice in sweetness, this machine is here, the Ombudopter with its eight propellers, a practice in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do we do with all this cash flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is both symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is equivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the great skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">In space to move in all directions, no matter which he rotates, or even how he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight prop.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things are available in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines have to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate bangers flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If you build them together, they act like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong - a motor or propeller falling off, the electronics or a battery -- can also fly the machine if constrained.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swans.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables an aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took customary micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and mocks them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit white where in the room they are and is self-controlled. this is why there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine since Broadway becomes a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wage is in development and your creative activity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows tripods heads to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economical potential, is the bag on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are getting faster, they turned into pure energy in a tense knowledge of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For a short moment, they illuminated brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they put your energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time plains and the universe exploded in gravitation.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events first.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, there was just a more serious life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has highlighted a lot: corals, Pisces, plants, dinosaurs, people, and -- God understand us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of more Mueller -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to build a huge laser detector, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometric gravitational Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of Ligo significantly increased, what the detection rate improved tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was started for a final test run around several smaller and stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detectors, the gravitational sleepers of the two collious black holes caused by the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional when they:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todfather's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, this was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, for I had worked, is not longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, the theoretical Physicist at MIT. he has been researched as Ligo measurable signals for 23 years and their by observatory signals like ligo measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational change is a mouse in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its total content will be stretched out into a direction and stolen in the other direction.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate lecturers lead in courses for the Relativity Theory, often a correct dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"Stretch and dust, stretches and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity swelling are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, everybody was stretched out of the waves of the waves and the elongation of an average human life was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. this was the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length must be measured precisely in less than a thousand grain of a nuclear nuclear. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt after the waves follows: "the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public there will be all obstacles to be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. scott likes to say, Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: face-like, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because you can take a picture or card of things by ensuring that of several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with tones.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean much of you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we laugh at specific properties like sound position and pitch, rhythm and volume to highlight the story.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"watch Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitation tables.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can make no easy pictures of objects in all-in with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by focusing on changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the measured frequencies are located for Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert the pattern in Shall, we can literally listen to all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">To laugh, you can betray us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has already been very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn on the two bodies very quickly, it sounds the same circulations with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement, stamped in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget, heard this sound like the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with a 30-fold sun mass, which turns around as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us overtake what it means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most densely body in all, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 sun, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is a completely new way to study the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to all the noise and the visible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in the space -- practical or generally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about that.</seg>
<seg id="538">The thrilling physical processes are done at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through, since these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravity flow through iron when it would be transparent glass. the urbang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see since it is covered by its own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">From frivitational tables it should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important thing: I'm optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen and of whom we have never seen and of whom we do not see. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo was just right in the first attempt, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague alongside the MIT, Matt Evans, is an important member of the Ligo project, says concerning this topic: me: the type of stars which show black holes are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are scouring for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo makes us an entirely different view to the events in All, on the emergence of stars and ultimately, as we emerged from this mayhem.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists to be brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to find great detectors and the robbery and the tropes of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a completely new generation of Observatory on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the uristle of all things?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would say to everything "Yes!" I was afraid of that.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether she made me nervous that in unpleasant situations I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Do I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Do I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Do I want to start playing with the spectacle?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that to do, wovor I feared, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, talking to keeping my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"Yes" my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"Yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life changed, unexpectedly. it began with a question of my minds.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three unbelievable daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the Smallest, calls all the 'accounts, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"I don't need milk for my cabling."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her, when I was just on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This time yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I still swear to play with them as soon as you do, or wherever I go, I am always saying yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I strive to make myself very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our families.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a disconcerting side effect: only recently I understood the "Yes" -sagen to play my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think, simply awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I am TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do not make TV really big.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for it to carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs, which did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days ago shows four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million US TV, four broadcasts that are in production at the same time: 24 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions will be available in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of this 70 TV-hour are shipments that I have created myself, and not only produced, so I have time to gather, creative time to gather my fans of campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV shows, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who work with so hard if you're a company, a country or a classroom, so you understand that I am not only interested in the computer, and it's right when I say: I understand that there is not a dream of dream dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I'm working much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work still creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set up troops, I climbed up on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as dreaming, one of the most clay, a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, strenuous, and inspiring, clinically and maternal, clinically and rappy. and the best to it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums start in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums rose like a busy road, I could go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take in when I declare these sums that I write about writing that writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with the TV production started to work and work, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a sums, then you can not strive differently than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that can not be different than size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">It is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's your ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I did not fail for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I want to tell you only, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it into question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear answer: every successful I will get more than ever more broadcasts, the more more sound, the more things happening at the same time, the more things are going longer, the more so I'm doing history, more than expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, right?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I carafe, the marathon, whom I run, the army that sums, the sums, the sums, the sums and sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overload, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "that I would like to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a TITANEN.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-TITANEN.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same thing as always: the same TITANEN work, 15 hours-days, aborated weekends, no remorse, no remorse, not delegates, but with all heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an indication Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I simply had no more fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when doing what you do, the work which one loves, suddenly?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some people think: "Heul you, the writer Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, one loves to be a teacher of being a banker, a painter, Bill Gates wherever you feel, and knows how the sums feel when trying to stop the sums even if the sums stops, who is one?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song sounds of my heart, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way back, late, and she says: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will tell no more than two things to be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">Firstly, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she called me not.</seg>
<seg id="675">It doesn't call no more "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did it happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I depressed Titan's and my sums, and it changes everything in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters down, we laugh a lot and read at the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude, and in the absence of Sumémens, I can do nothing but to be mounted.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I carafe, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists, sticky fingers and damp, tender voices, wax crayons and song, where it is slump, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolving.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and a burst slide comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And this is not right now, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's remain with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working ums, which is titanium, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, if I tell you who I am, if I describe my brain using video and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent upon love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the electricity that comes from the living.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real Summen ignore the pressure of history, which reflect on complete tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">Genuine sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered to God the wrong words, because God said to me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">When my child will play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this to be sure that I can free myself as a workaholic of all guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing, I don't play that way as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am still working because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a man rather works to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">To be honest, I call myself "Titan.</seg>
<seg id="729">I need to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We slawn around in the garden, before and back, and her.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst out bubble.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so I predominantly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always gretmen after my cell.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, till I wonder? why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can say it too! do you always say Yes, if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a daytrip.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug fixes me or cookie.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, no longer need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes before, even on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no deposit.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to go.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my comfort, my world. there is no need to be the children. it is considered to have a place for his mind-peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm cheerable and I will take care of friends, books that day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"you want to play?" it is short for everything that I got up when I was my first TV show when I was a Titan at the training, when I wanted to make me more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not allow full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums got back in my spare time. the sums seems to return soon when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without any games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. I love it again and my soul. I will use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it not.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums are not mine... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubble fingers and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now this is my humming.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of labour is part of me, but only a part. and so I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is schnuppe that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan before going to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my fires still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I am, the happier I and my kids.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I'm playing, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I plays, the more clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I plays, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I plays, the more I hear the sums. the land, which I carafe, the marathon, whom I drive, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the other, the sums of life: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel like this sums, the more makes this unusual, stunning, naked and new life experience in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think of things, I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, this means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreameless.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="793">We don't have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from a second to the other, after a heavy stroke or car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-help.</seg>
<seg id="800">After serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve your nervous functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "lowjob-stimulation" and implanted a electrode deep in the brain to manipulate the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's destiny, causing severe citrus and severe pains.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation is not means Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional Neurosurgery is the restore of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was an executive director and a day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with brain trauma-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that with brain trauma-traumata braweary the brain and the skull pressure rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">But one must sometimes remove a proportion of swollen shepherds.</seg>
<seg id="817">Rather than using the swollen sheds of sheds, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues to analyze a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">The cells of a tissue is comparable with very small children that can be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the proper nutrition, temperature, moisture and environments to deflect them.</seg>
<seg id="823">We had to do that with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you are still knowledge of the Biology class that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves in every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has tricels, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches from the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising that type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP was preserved.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly, and after a few weeks it died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange chemical population, which looked like stem cells but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells emerge doucortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus it cares for the development of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">Why are they supposed to receive us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that in the healing of the brain, since we found them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, allowing the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain in the non-language area and then aculate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then labeled in color to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we planted it at the decision of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimate the same cells in your brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we observed the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely taken away, they go back home. the room is already filled, they will not be needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now they stopped the cells, -- it grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show, are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro, in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we exercised monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take cover pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable skill level, we passed the motor motorized cortex into the motor motorized field.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thus the monkeys were pulmoned, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they thrilled spontaneously until a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover plastic brain mechanisms. recover from a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure, the affair had reached his degree of the spontaneous recovery, we planted it in its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey who restrained spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can take about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not as accurate and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, as we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after reimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that's very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found very much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathologic models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implants the human being.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that as soon as we can show you how the human brain is the means to heal himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure now, just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone you might need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely fall.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. considering these great results you have to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicately, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: Yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- You have completed research and trying to get permission to start clinical trials like many years, until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to choose patients to do and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first say that it is useful before taking this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's sure. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us of it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake, to consider it as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy as the fragile plant which it is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as a variable habit.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitably leads toward democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big heahmer in Beijing certainly proved that it is possible to have an flowering capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy stays completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy appears in us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government - was unmissable to me as the Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- not the Spares would have to be realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my competent friends who had said to me if democracy would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I call you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our companies will become mixed, our future gloomy and great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">For waste, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction which currently endangered our hosts.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit paradox".</seg>
<seg id="916">One peaks is known to you. they know and recognize it as the Schuldenberg, who throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet few see his twin ymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest it, however, to invest it, where it would be productive and earnings, with which one needs to produce the debt, which is urgently needed, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in the US, in England and in the Eurozone, in all the prosperity producers, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 billion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, that at the same time in those countries and our financial institutes accumulated, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange rates and the property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So debts and unproductive capital are the twin wheels, which are not aligned through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-olds within the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently there is a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which it could not invest it. exactly like Öedipus Father, who could not be true that his son would kill him if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Uncertain circumstances bring down the circumstances caused by him that opus will kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hademy with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His very extravagant Art. All the unproductive capital should be used to develop our lives, developing human talents and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies, which are decisive for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think, but before we proceed: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the company form, in which the free and poor as a majority can control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy was of course too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to decrease the job of athic democracy because of these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">Making the decision of the Athenian democracy and it is that she gave the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which granted them the right to political compilation with equal vote weighting in questions of state belassing.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy have not kept long.</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines brightly, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today liberal democracies have not roots their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While athic democracy grew on the free citizens focused and the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy first came to see when a full separation of politics and economy was feedited and the democratic process was imbordered on politics, while the economy was the world of corporations - a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">Our present democracies have been held since the date of which this breakdown from politics and the economy began, an inherited struggle between the two, where the economy is gradually migrated and foreignited.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wish, why the politicians do not like the work?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is about that people can be nowadays in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics is revolted and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadn with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in such a way like a herd of roughness, the animals that it feeds on, decimated, decimated by the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is concerned with the economy that the politics is so far knew that it grows through the self-causing economic crisis itself. political goods are deemed to expire the economic demand, and the general level of corporations are deprived to invest in the company's cash.</seg>
<seg id="948">The "Demos" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" the "Demos" [the people] distributes from the democracy, the higher the twin wheels, and the greater the waste of human labour force and the wealth of humankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">Marxist Linke had already done this idea over 100 years ago and it was not particularly easy.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the deacity of the Soviet Union should be, that the workers are only revived by a miracle, as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low wage employees by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics can be higher, the automation around the twin wheels are higher, the waste dump content, and the social conflicts lower, as soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So, we have to redesign the economy and remind the areas of economy and politics, and respect that we would like to reate the restored area, otherwise, in a disease-describing Hyperautocracy, which leaves the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">Thus, the question is not whether capitalism has brought up technical achievements he will survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a thrystopia, similar to the "Matrix", or by something that the society in "Star Trek" is similar to humans and in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations to the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what brillies it so, how could it look like this "Star Trek" or similar utopia instead of "matrix" similar diystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation, i want to give you some examples of course shortly.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please make a capital market prior to which you have generated money while you work and in which your capital is coming to you from a firm to the next, and the company - no matter what is currently working - is the property of which currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="964">No difference between those who work the company, but do not work in it, and employee who work there, but no more diving between capital and labor, no big gaps between investment and sars, and ultimately no sensoral twin wheels.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please introduce that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and every government pays the sum, representing the trade deficit or the merchandising of the country in a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment equals are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had been proposed in the Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that you didn't had to implement the technical resources right then.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we, in particular, in front of the background of a reunited policy and business.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe them is the same time, becoming more privileged and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash bin of history, and gerynesians, global gerynesians.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we watch in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we drop in a "Matrix" - like Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer will depend on how we are politically decide.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we are doing it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography himself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and business is... doing that the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand what Larry Summers are called "long-term stubnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it is not only our democracies destabilizing, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is quite relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I'm a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes is, and therefore I'm entirely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not working, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said it. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you keep from the viewpoint of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have a note of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, during the area where the most of the economy is playing - a wholly imperial zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain extent, if I may say the provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remind -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy - this is an error, historically informative.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China, similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China presume to do that which has done the West in the 19th century, smells huge after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious to your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: Yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you return six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to get a new beginning with the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely us to say goodbye, and to persual denial that a massive rise in the Eurozone fell asleep and continues to keep the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to lay on the basis of Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion was to reveal [them].</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately it was right. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone would continue to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to obtain an economic system, which is not viable to obtain through political will and authoritarianism, but if the change occurs, it occurs abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistake in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example, YV: everybody who looks back - Harvest juice...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance, or any minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he claims not a mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the money ampler, to find a joint solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring to our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the promises, which went through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They refused to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the money raised to us, stacked: "that was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, despite the aggressive waist of talks, you seem to be quite a European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the euro area comes from somebody, who lives and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My major fear is that the euro zone is not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Because when it does not survive the released creeps will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have consequences for Europe catastrophic consequences, but for the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we propose ourselves to the way of a postwar in 1930, after which it appears, it will also be as dreaming for the future of Europeans like the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price never heard that, although he probably never heard for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision, Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has an Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible to produce the shows and content of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought branch.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He needs to find shows that are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that turn right on this turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating map of more than 2500 TV series on the site. the review shows 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Will evaluate your show with nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, whenever you have a season, your brain is asking: "where are there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not stand on the left side of the turn, because I think you need particular intelligence to undergo "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He is more thoughts about the average exploitation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they don't amaze you.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something, therefore Roy Price wants to risk no.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so it keeps a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and displays them online where they can watch free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon does not answer your stuff, one gets too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers take this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watching the shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">By Roy and his team, they are watching everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You may capture when you start the show, when one makes a paused, which parts to jump and look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to make sure what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they process the data, process these and resulting from the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four Republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did that show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House" but it seems that not many of this show cannot be reminded because they were not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only a median show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House has landed at 7.5 -- i.e. something above the average, but not exactly what does Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time with another company, another manager has been placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly as Roy is always searching to find this one super show and he does not use data for it, but he makes it somewhat different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team have viewed the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews given to the shows whose shows they like them like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">They then use these data to find out these small details about the audience: which shows they like producer, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts, they entered a car and decided not to make a Sitcom on four Senators, but a drama series about an ator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this bend. so exactly there where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very expert, data verified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic had somehow dared that all should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, for a decision which is going to meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have a back-up for 200 years.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimised by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindething you can expect is good TV, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis did not work, then this is a bit scary because we live in time, in which we learn more and more about statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room comes in contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is staying in the prison and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">It is not always the best results. that's not about that a company does not know how multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data vernishing firms are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does sometimes make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google announced that they can predict through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worse way -- through data analysis of the Google-Records.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news coverage. the success was created in a publication in Nature's magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just year round, year, until it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data verify firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flow from life to life a -- at work, in case of law through medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many trouble with data. I work in the computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized a few patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you need to solve a more complex problem, do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first cut this problem in its parts so you can analyze the single parts; as second place, put the parts together to get a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and place again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just fine for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to assemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there's something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again to summarize, even if the information is incomplete then, if the brain is of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix as successful as they have used data and mind, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand the audience, why they otherwise did not have been able to recompile all these parts, and resulting from a show as "House of Cards." this is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant she entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they were looking for TV ideas, then select "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things are going wrong to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerfully they are, data is just a tool, and to forget that is rather useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was written, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball," it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question, you only need to shake the ball to get a reply. "most probably" -- right here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">Later, I will come up with a technical demo demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have met some decisions in my life so far I should listen to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have available the data, you would like to replace them with something much owing it, like data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball lush and loner and loner. ultimately, it is about us to make decisions, if we want to achieve something unusual at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paying off, choices to meet, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For at the end, there are not the data but the risks, which you land at the right end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
