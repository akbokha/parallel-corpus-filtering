Munich 1856 : four cards that change your look to the city
one Irish An@@ st@@ alt , where people are going to meet young people .
a sal@@ ary chapel , where the tunnel will now be du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultiv@@ ates the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of the coin encour@@ ages exciting stories about days .
it is ner@@ vous when landing cards are not currently present .
it knows everybody who had to meet again because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green me@@ adow instead .
the historic maps of the Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer by the Ge@@ op@@ ort as Bayern of the State Government , are all other than currently - but very techn@@ ically informative .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
then , as cities and municip@@ alities in the Munich Stock Exchange has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a Flick@@ ente@@ jo that is not recognis@@ able as such .
the large super@@ vis@@ ation card were developed for cities and municip@@ alities in more detailed maps , so called Ur@@ ons@@ dat@@ ashe@@ ets .
these were formed as the result of the Bavarian extension between 1810 and 1864 and early as the first distribution of Bay@@ ern@@ s .
your Princip@@ le : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 the French army leader had occupied Bavaria during the Second Co@@ alition War with Austria .
in Napoleon I wish to an overview of the occupied country and gave a topo@@ graphic survey of Bay@@ ern@@ s , of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops dis@@ man@@ t@@ led with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February 1801 , it was the same @-@ day neighbo@@ urs that created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria card .
the Elec@@ tor Max . Joseph went forward to the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Ver@@ ification Amplif@@ ier .
the original position for Munich is from the year 1856 and is available as any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
early as early as early as the country &apos;s capit@@ ol is the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in 1856 in the 1856 map .
Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map , which was part of the Munich district in 1877 .
today it is located in the middle of the city .
the houses were built in 1856 in 1856 of today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the opening of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : there is a smaller map with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written flags , from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ photo , &quot; which was derived from the property tax .
small plots have no more farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the facility &quot; Land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is situated north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , founded in 1810 , was actually still a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an in@@ sight into the history of psych@@ iat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ ons@@ ons@@ blatt read in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Ha@@ id@@ hausen just the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ e@@ ig &quot; or from the height &quot; On the fan &quot; - but also in great letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
Yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field road you will once un@@ lock people with trav@@ ellers .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt managed by the Au@@ er fans . &quot;
in 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gud@@ run the ment@@ or - those Psych@@ iat@@ rist , who was transferred to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the att@@ ach@@ ettes of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
in addition , he has taught the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum Ha@@ id@@ hausen , who has been working for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
a first place for 280 patients was extended to 500 places later .
some@@ time this capacity reached no more - the reason for the construction of the cycle complex in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psych@@ iat@@ ry since 2006 .
on the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt now ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents in the Munich of Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and turned him into a youth @-@ house with voc@@ ational training .
west lies the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; built in an architectural approach to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt which was bom@@ bed during WW@@ II during WW@@ II .
the Marien@@ platz was marked by 1856 as &quot; main square . &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alle@@ y . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of the min@@ ds .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 had many holes in the city center .
a great remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a p@@ inn@@ acle from the Middle Ages , once began to work on the Marien@@ hof , where these days will work and take place on 5 April 2017 of the gro@@ und@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can be li@@ vel@@ ed with the air picture from today - and the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
civil rights group released travel warning for Miss@@ ouri
the National Association for promoting dyes has issued a warning for colored people who travel through dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating politics and rac@@ ist attacks on the state to Miss@@ ouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Ad@@ visory authority for the federal state of Miss@@ ouri , which until August 28 , 2017 will be oblig@@ ed to bring great attention to the Federal State of Miss@@ ouri , a number of frag@@ rant , rac@@ ism @-@ based inten@@ tions in recent times , occurr@@ ing in the entire state and say , &quot; it &apos;s in the statement of the group .
a recent adopted law of Miss@@ ouri , which deli@@ ber@@ ately makes people har@@ der to win dis@@ cri@@ mination bodies , as well as the prosec@@ ution of State , the Group to publish the group , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; you have in@@ jur@@ ies the civil rights , people happen .
they are challeng@@ ed because of their skin &apos;s colours , they are put together or killed , &quot; said President of Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kan@@ sas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such a warning that has exhibited the organization for a state in the US .
the group cited as rac@@ ist actions against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in the early days in the beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police of Miss@@ ouri in custody without a crime .
the Council also demonstrated on a recent report by the Office of the Office of Miss@@ ouri , in which black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and collabor@@ ators , what could happen to Miss@@ ouri , &quot; Chapel said .
&quot; people must be ready to bring credit money , or let the relatives let us know that they are travelling by the state . &quot;
Miss@@ ouri reported 100 Hass@@ ins in 2015 , after the latest numbers from the F@@ BI &apos;s enemy &apos;s coverage of F@@ BI , who entered the state in terms of the number of such in@@ jur@@ ies to the 16th place in the country .
the gro@@ unding is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri @-@ Law which was more difficult to compl@@ ain a company because of residential or employment dis@@ cri@@ mination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) had issued out@@ war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted un@@ mig@@ rat@@ ory authorities , to conce@@ ive people because of immig@@ ration viol@@ ations , what is to contribute to the AC@@ LU on further stream@@ lining profiles .
comm@@ ences are generally issued by foreign affairs for other countries , but in recent years , st@@ ak@@ eholders &quot; groups have to be in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
We@@ ide@@ z@@ aun@@ ching project is elem@@ entary
the We@@ ide@@ z@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ re @-@ handed Peter White and Cord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have a picture in front of a picture .
in the celebration of the family of Schwen@@ de@@ mann , the representative of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U @-@ village met with may@@ or Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann transferred in@@ sights into its premises in which he farms 55 hectares of me@@ adows and 40 hectares of forest @-@ farms , 40 dairy k@@ iss@@ es and as well as many young k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five flats .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is the alternative marketing way for the milk of its co@@ ws , so sw@@ iv@@ elling .
excluding the table of the guests , local visitors arrive exclusively .
as he is also the BL@@ HV Pre@@ sidency of Fis@@ bach , he called the We@@ ide@@ z@@ aun@@ ching project as &quot; elem@@ entary &quot; . &quot;
I can not establish on der@@ art parts .
the gre@@ ens area concerns a lot of work , much nuts are processed using the sense sense .
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and to@@ graphy , &quot; st@@ ressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
in 2003 he acquired free operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fert@@ il@@ izers , even if he makes no bio@@ business .
Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the commun@@ e has recognized the meaning of the course of course and is very happy with the leader funding . &quot;
at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are you need to be supported by farmers .
I hope that the re@@ aff@@ ore@@ station of the areas could go out yet a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and thought about how to continue their operation , &quot; st@@ ressed the may@@ or .
farmers often stand in the criticism of funding
a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the open area is therefore 40 hectares , which are not en@@ rolled out until at least 2023 .
of the total cost of € 71 500 , half of the leader was funded , a quarter contributed to the town of F@@ ishing .
thus we connecting the farmers 12 610 Euro , who they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of We@@ ide@@ z@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained sw@@ iv@@ elling .
Kord@@ ula Kov@@ ac pra@@ ised : &quot; you do a really good job , without land farmers and land . &quot;
for Peter White , also : &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot;
the landscape of the Land@@ scape Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state subsi@@ dy of soft f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ funded subsi@@ dy .
in addition , the in@@ efficient area must not be in@@ efficient ( hang@@ over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ aff@@ ore@@ station .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently under construction for the Fis@@ her@@ nia project in 2018 , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .
the open area covers 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est mark of a regime change is enough to start att@@ acking the stat@@ ues .
the Americans appreciate this as any other - therefore the c@@ auti@@ ously staged Saddam Hussein &apos;s place on the Fir@@ m place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in the year 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olog@@ ists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbo@@ lic act in a heated disp@@ ute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the proposals of the President on a dra@@ stic restri@@ ction of the legal immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ des of cru@@ ci@@ ans and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have been l@@ yn@@ ched when he had done it .
but he grab@@ bed its importance , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to when the famous po@@ em of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , was added to his base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta sh@@ im@@ ped : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American Freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to refer later and not part of the original statue of Liberty is . &quot;
Miller is really proper , but as he himself is form@@ ulated , it &apos;s not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your trouble , &quot; your arms , your arms , and your wor@@ sh@@ y masses , which means to bre@@ athe freely to bre@@ athe freely .
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ende waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller received no criticism in literary criticism - he clearly knew that these people are not welcome at Tr@@ ump States .
this conflict of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural con@@ front@@ ation : it is indeed a conflict for the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who prefer to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they were a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and Americ@@ an@@ ic re@@ publi@@ can show that in a se@@ wn classical image depic@@ ting the female em@@ bo@@ died of freedom .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her po@@ em the female figure is no more abstract - it has received a voice .
and they themselves have a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the board with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a dev@@ ast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change their right wing this way .
the Great Schre@@ ih@@ als Rush Lim@@ construc@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapt@@ ist for the Com@@ ing of Tr@@ ump , argument in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was mon@@ opol@@ it@@ ative , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ ative that moves to the American flame : &quot; Lady Liberty is proce@@ eding ahead .
it should wear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not light the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ construc@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of per@@ c@@ eption of per@@ c@@ eption .
the great variation of Lazarus was there to see them as they saw from exhau@@ sted , el@@ derly , but hope@@ ful people after long and often hor@@ rible trips on the deck@@ s of ships .
it is the true sense of seeing the world from a perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue is talking to them the words of hope and the welcome you have to hear .
and this is , of course , not to recogn@@ ise the perspective , Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but the hat@@ red , which is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Ne@@ il Black attrac@@ ts Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members at a time when only two sh@@ all@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain .
the performance of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Ne@@ il Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish Kon@@ t@@ ing@@ ent in the world championship team &quot; will aff@@ ord a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athl@@ ete was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; something special has developed in Scotland &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn .
&quot; we welcome we , and we are trying to understand , and we will continue to find out until we &apos;ll find out . &quot; said Black .
&quot; I &apos;m talking with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athl@@ ets remember that it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ets are medals of medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir William Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m track , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle has chosen the team captain .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite mod@@ est .
her chapters was incredible , &quot; says black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Schott@@ isch , or wher@@ ever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and true sense of course brought Eil@@ id@@ h quite naturally , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , which will compete with their fifth world championships for the 400 m Hur@@ dles , says it &quot; belie@@ vable &quot; is that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots in the British squ@@ ad are .
the best total number of athletes at the world championship were seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ route Mu@@ ir led to this path and has placed five British records and two European records last year .
it will participate to the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m run@@ ners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which is 1,500 m running , is another Scot@@ sman that is going to be watching the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the 30th Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remin@@ ds of her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the European capit@@ ol states that it is &quot; trem@@ end@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also among the medals and for the Fin@@ als .
&quot; to be so special about the team cap@@ tains , it is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ate chose to me and chose something very special for me , &quot; added them .
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech considered as a captain ?
Yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it &apos;s just so great atmosphere there . &quot;
block from Brow@@ ning &apos;s Facebook : do not apply to a public office if you don &apos;t have to wear the sel@@ ector of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers tell him , from the interior policies to his political principles .
he im@@ min@@ ates with the cr@@ iti@@ que , sure .
but he didn &apos;t bring his critics to silence .
because in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; the freedom of freedom can be removed - and , dum@@ b and m@@ ute , we are led like sheep to batt@@ les . &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Govern@@ or Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an who doesn &apos;t have to work anymore as Washington .
Hog@@ an employees have blocked the posts of at least 450 people and er@@ ased out their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this week because of this week .
the rod of the governor dropped the complaint as fri@@ vol and the online comm@@ entary was full of a counter@@ part with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people told .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s very important if it &apos;s like Hog@@ an .
this is a re@@ publi@@ can governor , in an overwhel@@ ming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
it has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an is no re@@ ac@@ tionary dog .
he has demonstrated a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict ad@@ her@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary resources to de@@ but@@ t with his vot@@ ers and play his ha@@ iry head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons that come to the side of the governor - which is officially called the public forum , which is officially called and the employees who are paid by public tax dollars - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Hog@@ an Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia grab@@ bed the actions of Govern@@ ors and argue that the amend@@ ment of the comments was nothing more than one moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of TRO@@ LL@@ EN or h@@ amm@@ am or h@@ asser@@ ized people using the wh@@ ip .
the post talked with some of the real people who were ho@@ oked by Hog@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no trol@@ ls .
they all said that their comments are respec@@ table , thoug@@ ht@@ ful and not prof@@ essed .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and comm@@ ent@@ ated Hog@@ an Catholic faith .
att@@ or@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bow@@ ie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted but she asked for an enemy .
&quot; I comm@@ ented , that I was dis@@ appointed that there was no reaction to fel@@ ony and other current news , &quot; wrote it in the news area of the news show &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate this idea also , if a number of people on the same theme , then it will be ac@@ counted as a much more collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the staff members of the governor as &quot; concentrated sp@@ am attack &quot; would definitely call &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by blocked a cr@@ itic or deleted a negative comment .
it &apos;s much cleaner than in previous days , when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edit@@ orials and to burn newspapers or demonstr@@ ators .
but exactly this is just digital .
Hog@@ an is not the first public offici@@ als that critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County had the last am@@ end@@ ment , according to US @-@ District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) was also received a visit from AC@@ LU on its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington &apos;s time , the time of the plan had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers also multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous stamp station@@ ed in his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous trol@@ ls .
people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Valer@@ ius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions .
Pet@@ itions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping by Great Britain , was overwhel@@ med up with historical documents , which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t bring them to silence .
freedom of expression , opinion , and discre@@ tion are on the basis of our nation .
and true gu@@ iding means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty ho@@ pes to be at home comfort in the Renaissance club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days of home comfor@@ ts as the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .

this is a great man@@ ne@@ quin for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to def@@ ending a championship , even though he won his 32 @-@ year career in both European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; said the players in South@@ port .
&quot; I can &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as they gained in the year after I was taken from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and there was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year .
it was a really special time and an that we will appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year for the European Senior Tour , returns to the promotion on home .
this event will be the first Scottish gig since the Aber@@ de@@ en As@@ set Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Her@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want it well , but you also feel that additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad we went away as far . &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoke
in the past two decades , less people have died because of a passive smoke of lung cancer .
as a result , scientists of the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , per year 167 of lung reb@@ ates can be attributed to Pas@@ sive smoke , &quot; said research leader He@@ iko Becher .
as a comparison , he moved up a study on this subject from 1994 .
there was more 400 lung reb@@ ates caused to spend more than 400 hours of lung cancer per year in Germany .
the new research is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; reason@@ ably more reason@@ ably located in time , &quot; the director of the designer Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the house of house connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ected as a reason that has not be noted in plans .
traffic , which always ob@@ struc@@ ts the construction work , is a big problem for the B@@ aut@@ ism of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ign@@ ancy of drivers from red amp@@ ules and lock@@ ers is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the line bus@@ hes are entitled to passage .

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gol@@ dland
if B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , they don &apos;t use any stove .
they even rarely use a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai village in the Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the hous@@ ew@@ ife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally named a &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly into the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the carbon@@ ated bulb with e@@ ager , un@@ washed hands is taken and sw@@ allowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - it has no furniture - where they also perform their daily work , for example clothes with fl@@ us@@ hing water out of the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a l@@ act@@ case .
as the youngest of the four wives of their man , their fields have been assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late can be dangerous , most of the vill@@ men are un@@ employed , and many drink hard , and there is soldiers .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es it , after 17 pm in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare in@@ sight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was en@@ rolled in Indonesia after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , responsible for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta to rule the control over the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the un@@ wanted part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then an org@@ inal 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses which are surrounded by bamboo and , made of corrugated f@@ ences , which were converted by rust in various red @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no fore@@ ign@@ ers .
before Christian Mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear this clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and Cle@@ ats on their vibr@@ ant , hand woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and her bright rock .
&quot; once we had only leaves to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the most p@@ oo@@ rest of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live among the poverty line and some of the worst children mort@@ ality rates and al@@ ab@@ et@@ isation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indones@@ ian Gol@@ dland .
the largest and most profitable gold dates of the world , Grass berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is situated only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high population of Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort established a total of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a population of about 78 billion US dollars worth of valu@@ ed $ 78 billion .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , who ensure that Indonesia is a strong presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel and units sold almost 20 million US dollars from 1998 to 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ vian demands on greater autonom@@ y stim@@ ulates the golden go@@ ose , and they will be mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to activ@@ ists , more than 500.000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 from the Indones@@ ian military , tort@@ ured and im@@ prisoned since 1969 .
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as O@@ es@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s were cul@@ min@@ ated according to the Asia Human Rights Commission for genocide .
the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .
&quot; we valu@@ ate Every@@ thing &quot; says it in a report of the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane taken from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as un@@ le@@ av@@ ory exec@@ utions and tort@@ ures - r@@ ape and electro@@ de@@ es are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal prec@@ ip@@ itation of peaceful demonstr@@ ations .
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to occurr@@ ing the number of victims , since every week occurred , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia &apos;s resear@@ cher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have been bol@@ ster@@ ed because Pap@@ u@@ as will bring resources to a state of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province became 83 % Christian but the demo@@ graphic trend is changing , as Muslim had mig@@ rants come from the population of the population of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ n sk@@ ins sell ro@@ asted chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ us sauce .
local people are strug@@ gling to stop here .
&quot; mig@@ rants started to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables from the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains Ab@@ le You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native to work at the province Capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - have tast@@ ed their own market . &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President of Jok@@ o Wid@@ odo , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his electoral campaign in 2014 , in@@ equ@@ alities and legal viol@@ ations in Pap@@ ua .
the former car@@ p@@ enter found 27 of the 29 distri@@ cts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pre@@ sidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we have approved in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will ful@@ fil our ho@@ pes that will restore justice , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was defeated only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October an end point .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two in@@ dones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness .
the children &apos;s rock@@ ed children said to them that they should switch on their head@@ lamps .
one of the soldiers took the anchor in her clay , and later returned with four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , pursu@@ ed and beat the group with their ri@@ fl@@ es , the victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group &apos;s group .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ an@@ us Ye@@ imo , was sm@@ itten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby Government Commission set out and the things es@@ cal@@ ated the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch before the local police station and the military command centre to ask justice .
they carried out cerem@@ on@@ ial hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in a circle and a bird sp@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators start to s@@ ore stones on police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was en@@ rolled , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal wireless : &quot; if the masses pass more than three resistance , when the masses was dead , it &apos;s called in a official document of TIME that the local media has not been released .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the director of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened danger , and called for peace and called for the amount to return home .
no one was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was shot suddenly into my left hand joint , &quot; he said TIME on the por@@ ch of his colourful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t know who has fired up , but says that the bul@@ let came from out of the ranks gathered here .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his co@@ us@@ in , the witness of shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and instru@@ cted his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who has received a name for many Indones@@ ians , the TIME in a dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I was k@@ iss@@ ed him . &quot;
the Che@@ k spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said re@@ por@@ ters that his officers decided to secure their station only . &quot; they are being attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ pping to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of the Pap@@ ua police , Com@@ mission@@ er Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more in@@ ju@@ red .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i visited a passion@@ ate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims , and gay to deal with historical alle@@ g@@ ences in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will not happen in the future , &quot; he said .
in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he viol@@ ate an extra@@ judi@@ cial mechanism for settlement of historical human rights viol@@ ations .
but the exception began almost immediately .
&quot; most in@@ jur@@ ies occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he year .
the point is that we are oblig@@ ed to address this viol@@ ations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto made a re@@ treat , on 5th June in Jak@@ arta with TIME and said , he had no plans to set a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is leg@@ ally regulated , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , who had accused the UN for crimes against humanity , having had no more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor during bloody viol@@ ations of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights viol@@ ations have already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the pan@@ i@@ ai fore@@ word .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such asser@@ tions towards disp@@ ute dis@@ belie@@ vers .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in an@@ xi@@ ety years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in pan@@ i@@ ai have fear of discuss@@ ing the inc@@ ident .
he says he was beaten by the military , having helped him to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I was buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; He says .
the sh@@ outs do not have stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police closed the vill@@ agers in the neighbourhood of Pan@@ i@@ ais , De@@ iy@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a b@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , the refused to bring a conscious man into the hospital , one person and 17 others were in@@ ju@@ red , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ an@@ us Dou@@ w , who had dro@@ w@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
controlled vill@@ agers prot@@ est@@ icated before the company &apos;s site office .
the police told that the vill@@ agers were cast out for officers that responded to war@@ nings .
but indi@@ gen@@ ous saying that the mobile Brigade began to shoot the in@@ dones@@ ian par@@ amil@@ itary police on the amount and killing a killing .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we &apos;re afraid that there will be re@@ ven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who was living near the hospital , as the in@@ ju@@ red has been delivered quickly , so the TIME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the De@@ iy@@ ai parliament is called to draw the officers for calcul@@ ating the police and the mobile Brigade of the police in the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ ru@@ he@@ gas for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satis@@ faction of the ordinary members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the Green Hochland of Pap@@ ua .
many , the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel Army , who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by pus@@ hing them from in@@ dones@@ ian soldiers and kid@@ n@@ ies of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people arrested thousands of people in pan@@ i@@ ai and took arbit@@ rar@@ ily in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; saf@@ egu@@ arding the national so@@ vere@@ ign@@ ty . &quot;
some dive never again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a trag@@ ic , forgotten location . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satis@@ faction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is just out of reach .
people here , what they eat : mainly not@@ a and vegetables and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian Rup@@ ies ( 75 cents ) .
in the course of time , economic un@@ equ@@ alities grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new mig@@ rants , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes .
the few jobs , which exist in the region , usually go to the better educ@@ ated and pro@@ sp@@ erous mig@@ rants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital , or the necessary skills to competitive their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in keeping in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chair@@ person of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
moreover , the restri@@ ctions of international media ab@@ uses international media .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalist Franck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille were de@@ ported Long@@ champ as a lack of support with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign has been re@@ medy the restri@@ ctions of coverage to promote transparency and development , not realised .
&quot; there are new dang@@ ers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indones@@ ian un@@ ser@@ ene provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua , with a credit st@@ jection and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains con@@ fin@@ ed to the immediate neigh@@ b@@ ors Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ onga , N@@ aur@@ u , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and widely used in@@ jur@@ ies &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have histor@@ ically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Minister Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a Nas@@ ir denied the pro@@ positions of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to destroy the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people in particular want to acknow@@ ledge that more foreign governments are aware of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Right amb@@ assador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and troubled him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the session , but an@@ onym@@ ized .
Indonesia , 2019 is another pre@@ sidential election , but the Pap@@ ua says that they probably won &apos;t agree again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ acks , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the president of the tribe of the Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the pan@@ i@@ ai people believe that it is living under the constant thre@@ ats of a military military , in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; he has to rep@@ ay .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ ev@@ ances , families of the pan@@ i@@ ai shot offered a last symbo@@ lic act of side@@ walk : the corp@@ se of a victim was closely linked to the police and the military station .
they may never know that perhaps they will never forget justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a living head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire destro@@ ys the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ ers from Dubai to the second time
a fire on Friday in one of the t@@ allest resid@@ ental towers in Dubai , in Dubai , took up hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 m he@@ ighted , 79 @-@ stor@@ ied building .
it is the second fire that is situated in only two years by the Hoch@@ haus that is called a random tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injury were not reported ; there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we were hal@@ ted with the fire alarm and the cry of the people .
we ran@@ ged down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a resident who took his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil defence authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 AM , time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) fire destroyed the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on provision of accommodations for those concerned .
the inc@@ ident may have questions about safety of materials used in fields of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damages from the cl@@ adding , an out@@ lining made for decoration or isolation , came .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for the insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ ade tower in June could have contributed cru@@ el to the rapid spread of a fire , about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Court ( IT@@ F ) has been with its large Davis Cup @-@ cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was just supported on two winning positions , Hau@@ k@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but even very valu@@ ed five @-@ set classic will remain the traditional rate .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only barely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision but are dis@@ appointed that our member states will not have the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said .
one will continue to work on improving the application .
it was not until the vote was before the proposal to get the final on a neutral place .

more than 1 out of 5 US travel@@ ers bring objects into the plane , finds a survey
a survey among air@@ pass@@ words revealed that more than 20 percent of deli@@ ber@@ ately or un@@ con@@ sci@@ ously banned items in the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration are den@@ ounced , among them at least 6 percent , while the aircraft was betra@@ yed , while they were acc@@ ident@@ ally forbidden .
less than 1 percent claimed , it bel@@ ied that they could have missed ir@@ ony with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey with more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ Charter@@ er , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also established that younger trav@@ ellers did not ab@@ andon the rules .
of those question@@ ed , en@@ cores that they have tried to fly with something that was banned from T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 % mill@@ enn@@ ials were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the X generation .
the most common objects which were deli@@ ber@@ ately contributed to T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent of those submitted to have consumed things with clinical control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ d@@ ents , and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ d@@ ents have also confirmed that they were deli@@ ber@@ ately associated drugs into the plane .
the company said it travel@@ ers all over the country to find out how many acc@@ ident@@ ally sm@@ ug@@ ged material could have taken by the airport security , and how many it had done clearly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA policy is a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain which liquids must take them , or how much it is .
so there is no surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA are conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA .
for a long time people thought the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ ged material .
liquids are based on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla stock Order
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k awarded with the huge number of pre@@ provisions for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far he has previously defeated so that part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their oblig@@ ation reservation .
in addition to the tri@@ umph@@ al figures on sales growth and even more gig@@ an@@ tic sales targets , Tesla winner El@@ on Mus@@ k at the announcement of the latest quarterly sur@@ plus : the canc@@ el@@ ations of the new mass market Model 3 for the first time period .
in recent months Mus@@ k often wor@@ shipped with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre@@ provisions for the new car , his extra@@ dition date .
now it cle@@ ared mus@@ k : from a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 conc@@ essions , 63@@ .000 had been re@@ drawn back .
critics had always pointed out on it , that there is only a non @-@ binding bookings .
in case of cancellation , Tesla worth the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 U.S. dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reserv@@ ation payment &quot; is complete .
there are now 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , stored Mus@@ k at a telephone conference with an@@ alyst@@ s .
however , due to date , the canc@@ el@@ ation of up to approximately twelve percent of all orders could be found , but the Tesla leader doesn &apos;t believe .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production page .
last year Tesla 84@@ .000 vehicles delivered .
2018 it - all models can be combined - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 bookings per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla creates his brand new , even in practice tested without bigger inter@@ ru@@ ptions with maximum util@@ isation .
many experts des@@ pair that this is possible .
but if there come to larger del@@ ays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations could be named for Tesla .

EPA b@@ oss P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ lies on account of the provisions of Obama &apos;s policy to reduce emissions
a day after he has been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environment Authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ ked air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of national environmental authorities , compared to re@@ ac@@ tions@@ faster than previous administrative efforts .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his prior place in a federal court .
it &apos;s about a deadline that ran on 1 October for states to comply with O@@ zone &apos;s base equipment standards .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would have to delay the ad@@ her@@ ence to a year to study the plan for more time to study the plan , and to avoid &quot; interested in local cho@@ ices or the economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was for a long time a reliable opponent &apos;s environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeat@@ edly has passed to block@@ bu@@ ke or delay repeat@@ edly , the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fu@@ els res@@ ist .
the recent change of sud@@ den revers@@ ing is the latest legal withdrawal for the P@@ ru@@ section regul@@ atory agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ Administrator has passed his authority to elim@@ inate the implementation of the Obama administration , the oil and gas industry monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane le@@ cks , to delay .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt revealed that his swe@@ eping at O@@ zone standards just hit the will@@ ing@@ ness of EPA to collabor@@ ate with the states through the complex process of tim@@ ely ful@@ filling the new standards .
&quot; under earlier management , the EPA often tried to stop the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to carry out by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an un@@ ification for carrying out the date , P@@ ru@@ itt that will cl@@ ung the EPA more than a do@@ zen times in its previous job .

Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche at the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday July 16th , at 16.@@ 30 am invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether its idyl@@ lic location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
visitors from the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can ench@@ ant up from this powerful place .
rescue and preser@@ vation of the oldest building in place have made friends and sponsors for their concerns .
Walter Martini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ en Klein@@ od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the W@@ uer@@ ttemberg capital . count Hermann von Sul@@ z was first mentioned in the mountain with the rec@@ tory parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eberhard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document &apos;s word it was a ter@@ rif@@ ic court except the former parish church , beside the former parish church , belonged to the church or the patron saint and not vice versa .
so there lived people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , was in addition to the sub @-@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still to be recognized in the town of Tum@@ our , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glor@@ ious sett@@ lements of the village .
ancient cards from time around the year 1600 are under@@ going this historical reality .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ a arose from the early medieval town of their own .
one Lord , who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained his own Church , and was able to inher@@ it this church .
therefore the law was linked to a priest , or to propos@@ e a new priest .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two hid in Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
the newly acquired bell was the first time in 16@@ 92 but later , in the second world war in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were inserted and the bell were st@@ olen .
the roof was dense .
in 1796 the French troops camp@@ ed close to the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as a fire@@ wood .
over@@ rides the remains of the church of 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius @-@ Gra@@ vey@@ ard was also served as the last rest@@ ing place for the dead from the Hör@@ schwe@@ iler .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower were left .
in the New Year 1834 , a storm came with the ste@@ ep@@ le and half .
to prevent mis@@ fort@@ une , the tower was ab@@ orted .
only the tower that has been existing today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ her from the &quot; creative reti@@ rement &quot; as the successor of Dieter ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant .
as a organis@@ er the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ ling@@ ens are invited on Sunday July 16th , at the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with ess@@ ays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matte@@ is .
local engineer Hartmut Rom@@ ann talks about the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 hrs .
at the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade a range of dr@@ aught is held before the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of trees and overlooking the forest to the forest , &quot; the organ@@ izers are fantastic views .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organ@@ izers aim for many suppor@@ ters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant which is of importance for tum@@ our and hearing .
the friends and suppor@@ ters are particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ iser Walter Martini .
Association wants to ver@@ ify author@@ ization of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; does not see a legal requirement for construction and has thus turned to the council .
the club &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim hon@@ ours , &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) is en@@ forced to return its approval for the er@@ ection of planned wind turbines in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is carried out rig@@ ht@@ fully .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette had no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was a wind force in Schw@@ alm@@ tal with a wind power concentration .
moreover , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , as well as the concentration of wind turbines is also possible . however , the concentration of wind turbines is also possible for the rest of the city .
such zones is to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of landscape .
the city Vier@@ sen had passed a few days earlier by a change in the area of land plant in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but the District Government is not approved , because of a format was lack@@ ing .
&quot; if the lack of execution is the author@@ isation of author@@ isation , however , said Christopher Er@@ kens , Chairman of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; said Christopher Er@@ kens .
the current state of the situation : the city council decided to res@@ ume the wind concentration camp in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; an author@@ ization of the district government is faced .
kens : &quot; this means the issu@@ ance of author@@ ization of wind turbines is excluded on this site . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding writ@@ ings have gone through the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; explained a spokes@@ man .
the circle takes them for the occasion to exam@@ ine the matter again .
however , they are likely not to continue that the trial is stopped .
with a view on running court on Thursday , the circle was not responsible for the arg@@ umentation of the Association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans on an area on Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , construction of four per 200 meters high win@@ ders .
already last year , the company had involved in the city of Vier@@ sen , le@@ ases with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of great investment .
with the construction of four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households could be covered - that corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ ers households .
the NEW Re will invest around € 20 million .
last summer , four wind turbines produced the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ n@@ ich at Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in the district Hein@@ berg .

town and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lang@@ ens@@ al@@ z@@ aer and people from the region should be re @-@ covering the shops in the downtown area in September .
the commercial association and city management want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lo@@ cken the inhabitants of the shopping centre in the city center .

that is planned to be a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
native companies also aims to present their apprentic@@ es .
in addition , the shops of the city center should invite you to &quot; midnight Sho@@ ppen &quot; .
not only aim is the promotion of the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , advertising spots are on radio , internet video and printed bag that point to the offer weekend , so Christian König .
municipal and commercial association cooper@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the commercial association and the city enter another stage in the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City centre . &quot;
these include new offers like the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to well @-@ open Sunday , reve@@ aling open Sunday , con@@ vers@@ ations with all tra@@ des@@ men and t@@ aver@@ aged to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and discounts on parking fees are also part of the concept .
if customer potenti@@ als are to be re @-@ opened or re@@ opened .
these include tourist visitors and tourists .
but many loc@@ als have lost the inner city downtown at shopping .
by the end , everyone would have to help to revi@@ ve the city center - to rent@@ ing the whole city and clubs .
it came to overcome with a network that surro@@ unds the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y that had said to be part in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , conductor of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared on the nation@@ wide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day for the first time five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities .
beside Bad Lang@@ ens@@ al@@ za , this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heil@@ igen@@ stadt and Ble@@ stor@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action of spring leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make sure that each citizen can affect their department store itself .

Tr@@ ump continued after tran@@ sc@@ aped tran@@ scripts of phone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and drivers from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called for a ph@@ ony with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to be heard , publicly to say that he would not pay for a planned cross wall .
the U.S. president im@@ planted him , because he had open@@ ly pointed the wall on the wall . according to report , he said to him : &quot; this cannot say the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his pre@@ sidential campaign to establish a wall in the southern border of the US , in order to pay a wall for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first appearance with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ b@@ ull were also published and contained a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ b@@ ull , that a trade for the USA refugees emig@@ rated to take over &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; st@@ up@@ id &quot; that would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; if he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ b@@ ull , &quot; this is the most pleasant call for all the day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford mass@@ acre : activ@@ ist @-@ rac@@ ial Lyn@@ ch@@ act as call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ player Ford Mercury drove through a group of vie@@ wers in the countryside , Georgia , and r@@ ags to the Ford bridge by Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came in order to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle ho@@ ist - took a long train on its c@@ ig@@ ar and looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside she@@ wed the in@@ m@@ ates in fear .
&quot; we want this --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie torn the silence when a young black man was dist@@ orted by passenger seat .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , this dre@@ ad@@ ful scene , which was played on July 22 , only a descend@@ ant .
but if a loop has thrown on the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; almost all of the gro@@ oves cut off in the public .
since 2005 , Om@@ bud@@ sman went back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to return to the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ t as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - seen from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged because of murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really un@@ pre@@ h@@ able that in all these years there was no only person to see , although we know who they are , &quot; did Tyr@@ one Broo@@ ks who helps in the organisation &apos;s organization .
&quot; it is a dirt st@@ ink on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year former Congress of the State of Georgia and a life for civil rights .
for him the dis@@ appointment as a dramatic call for han@@ dic@@ raft and is constit@@ uted a yearly memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice wasn &apos;t correc@@ ted .
&quot; we want prosec@@ ution , we want reference , we want healing , we want to reconc@@ ili@@ ation , but first of all we need justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot get healing and reconc@@ ili@@ ation until we get justice . &quot;
a court case puts a bed linen over the bodies of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files that were obtained from N@@ BC News , over 50 men were susp@@ ected from North Dru@@ ch@@ process in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the open stand for decades , leg@@ ally say that the l@@ yn@@ ch actions for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court rendered a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia to the first time in the summer season , to ad@@ mit their voice in the summer .
at about at the same time as the option st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI , the black paint roller Roger Mal@@ com had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fighting , allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the s@@ caff@@ ol@@ ding in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby that she carried away not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , had 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , the F@@ BI .
he was invited to prison by Dor@@ othy and her co@@ us@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when she was removed from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge collap@@ ses , ring@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car .
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison who has prepared and arranged the Mor@@ se , which includes a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a con@@ spir@@ acy between the state and local prosec@@ ution that was not only involved in the murder , pro@@ ofs removed and the identity of witnesses has destroyed . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more pre@@ y .
&quot; it was a electoral campaign , &quot; he said .
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community . &quot; if you wish to register and then vote you will happen . &quot;
during almost a decade , Cass@@ andra had directed the annual dis@@ appointment of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
its representation is clearly , tangible , and is based in a type of pro@@ found rac@@ ism that many believe that in America it is no longer exists .
it is hard to look and more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will be con@@ fron@@ ted with its sk@@ ill@@ ity in all of us . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen or listen to me what I have done through . &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a do@@ zen White and the rest Black - in a room and lu@@ red as gre@@ et started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ au@@ ds since years , but he said that the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to preserve these history in life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester , and ur@@ ged him to slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , &quot; n He@@ ar , get away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona con@@ v@@ ents the fire .
there is a break .
and then every ( at least all black actors ) crash@@ es in laughter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh at lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still k@@ lay@@ ed .
&quot; I just do not believe that white people were saying &apos; n &apos; n &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; I wo@@ ke one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only have to make the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and exactly there is the energy in the room , a feeling of camera replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is concerned with this , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene once began .
this time , if Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this rep@@ et@@ ition will be viol@@ ent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman with a fun@@ er@@ al dress , stands above the corp@@ ses of actors and performs &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four do@@ zen swe@@ at swe@@ at swe@@ at and tears of your eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
a pair of travel@@ ed from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travel@@ ed to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they experienced around eight hours of Georgia when Broo@@ ks kid@@ n@@ apped them on a pilgri@@ mage to the grave of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ se has stayed an Ane@@ cd@@ ote , but now , when writing on the same country , the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de feels swe@@ pt out .
when the last notes of Songs , Gre@@ ene invites you to inspec@@ t the amount and to inspec@@ t the body name .
kids sw@@ allow at their heads , register f@@ ake blood and f@@ og@@ ging body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as he wants to re@@ mind .
after a few minutes there are gre@@ ens the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actor thro@@ wing the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and w@@ ipe out their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , who has played the man member of the C@@ lan@@ ade .
Nick Ras@@ cona surro@@ unds two of his players and breaks down in her arms . the emotional burden of the performance break through him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this out of a reason . &quot;
later the audience sets up with the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair from Atlanta is excited about the dis@@ placement with a black pair which she had just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gles to find words that you feel the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and de@@ eds ... from people coming to you who look like yourself and what they like , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; which really does that really do with me , the Lyn@@ ch will still continue , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called &quot; Police shooting . &quot;
in the same room Tyr@@ one Broo@@ ks courtyard k@@ icked off at his table , it e@@ ats and remin@@ ds of the citi@@ zen@@ ship .
he said he has already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the dis@@ location is in@@ spir@@ ing , for it describes the cry of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it is so if we learn it , then it can happen again .
if anyone does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own history is to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; Per@@ vers@@ ed the Wag@@ an@@ ians in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sets a colourful setting of giant , six @-@ story scenes .
the rotary ho@@ stage ( designed by Ale@@ k@@ sand@@ ar DE@@ NIC ) is one of the fo@@ aming street corner with a laying of a wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aces and El@@ aste &quot; logo in GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before par@@ ked an open Mercedes car , where the Rhine is pus@@ hing as a rock player , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
the oil dep@@ ths rec@@ all cast@@ ors of cast@@ ors - money , power and gre@@ ed - which draws through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ gold - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ izing as soon as in the Rhein@@ gold &quot; mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous .
K@@ ess mis@@ lead them Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , crus@@ hed a corp@@ se into the trunk , and put the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing is singing in great Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heavy @-@ weight car@@ box@@ ers .
brutal scene , as he strikes Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) has to believe this .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
storm@@ y , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who are mod@@ est and strengthened the hands for the fi@@ ance .
big Be@@ if@@ all , for the first time there is for the first time on stage - on the face of the big heat back in quiet re@@ cre@@ ational clothing .
the performance was expected with tension by Frank Cast@@ orf and his reg@@ i@@ ete@@ am .
if he had to inv@@ ade a g@@ ell@@ ent pipe concert in 2013 , he gave it five years later , in which the &quot; BU@@ H &quot; calls were to under@@ go .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with cast@@ at , but it also has a understanding of its view .
I take a positive res@@ ume .
max Quantity works as volunteers
they work at several locations in their volunte@@ er year .
where everywhere ?
amount : usually in the furniture shop , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .

and then a engineer study , we say that successfully canc@@ eled .
I recognized for myself that it is for me , and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
make a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se because you can see how it happens in the focal point , maybe .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have gathered great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will study in mind , probably do a social worker and study in Hamm at the Fach@@ hochschule in Her@@ ne .
is it not some unusual , while volunte@@ er have several different sites ?
quantity : Yes , it &apos;s very variable .

Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost program , a plan for costs for further 300 million pounds ( 394 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was taken by fast step towards the digital learning .
the company , which had sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding in P@@ engu@@ in Rand@@ om House in the past month , said that the outlook for the business year remains unchanged , after the first half of 2012 had achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2,@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ voy &apos;s attack of Kabul : NATO soldier killed in su@@ icide bom@@ bing
a su@@ icide bom@@ b attacked a military con@@ voy in the Af@@ gh@@ an capital Kabul , attacked a soldiers of NATO and several other in@@ ju@@ red , say offici@@ als .
five soldiers and a interpre@@ ter were in@@ ju@@ red , shared by NATO .
according to local reports , there were also three civilians per@@ ished at the inc@@ ident in the Q@@ arab@@ ic district .
the bom@@ bing is the last viol@@ ent that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a self @-@ mor@@ sel killing two people in the vicinity of the Ira@@ qi emb@@ assy in Kabul .
in a statement of NATO &apos;s opinion , the explosion was done on Thursday evening when a common pat@@ rol with the Af@@ gh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; of people made impro@@ vised explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
the testimony told that all in@@ jur@@ ies are in a stable state and are treated at the U.S. military hospital on Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
correspon@@ d@@ ents say that the growing strength of the Tal@@ ib@@ an and the group that is known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the near Bag@@ ram .
according to UN statistics , there were at least 1.@@ 662 entries in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
in late July , a su@@ icide Auto@@ bom@@ b killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Tal@@ ib@@ an said they would have done this attack .
on 31 May , there was a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the city centre more than 150 people with the dead@@ ly mil@@ it@@ ant attack of the country , since the U.S. attack led the Tal@@ ib@@ an by power .
the power under@@ scores the pre@@ stige security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. president Donald Tr@@ ump decre@@ ed , to increase the number of U.S. troops , military and police in the country .
correspondence must say that the hom@@ icide bom@@ bers in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani .
EPA is the dec@@ eler@@ ation to del@@ ays the smo@@ g rule after cl@@ auses
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , abol@@ ished , after which the states are oblig@@ ed to em@@ it the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states charged the agency because of the ste@@ pper .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to en@@ force the so called &quot; o@@ zone Rules 2015 &quot; and said they will show the oblig@@ ation of agency to cooper@@ ate with States .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and on our state partners , &quot; said EPA &quot; b@@ oss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt said in an explanation .
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the inten@@ tion of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which parts of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions have to be determined to hold more str@@ ing@@ ent air quality standards - to delayed by one year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largest democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed a claim on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of president Donald Tr@@ ump tries to revi@@ ve a wide range of environmental impact assess@@ ing the former President Barack Obama , a part of a wider agenda , which is to revi@@ ve economic growth .
however , the efforts have trig@@ gered the set@@ backs of Democrats and the con@@ servation groups that worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
the EPA website tells that the exposure of air which o@@ zone includes &quot; the lung function and amplif@@ y the re@@ spir@@ atory symptoms , &quot; such as as@@ thma .
community wants to be common
in the end , the decision was clear : in two votes , the council covers the establishment of a common room in the future Senior citizens .
there is an important story in front of the debate : the contract of purchase for the missing part is signed , says may@@ or Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it still does not last until the church community has belonged to the parish church , there is no planning tool for this project by a private invest@@ or .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat , offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space of around 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the council propos@@ es such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the senior living area , but open to the community .
for example , the word made from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision , which has been decided by providing support for the ongoing household , has been decided in the last autumn by means of funding .
the construction is situated in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be reported that T@@ j@@ ams , with 60 percent of 30 percent is eligible .
the compl@@ ain@@ ment looks to sign the invest@@ or that in this respect you will not want to throw away a b@@ ill@@ ary between the legs , as well as P@@ ult@@ l@@ ach - which reduces the lifting height and the construction of economic power - would be possible .
un@@ need@@ less , so dis@@ cri@@ es not only Wilfried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this supplement .
if it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously it happens to the Panel .
not as simple as the common room .
Daniela reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which you are not going before , now they are now in the common room from the window , says : &quot; I am really doing so . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger essenti@@ ally speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal invol@@ vement .
it is behind him a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dies to end@@ ang@@ ible or even foreign investors .
that is just not so , because with the acquisition of the area you won &apos;t give a supplement , but only a real , in a bil@@ i@@ fall , is the counter@@ part .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers proposal to apply labels according to the decision , finds three adv@@ oc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are summar@@ ize the resolution : &quot; if we hold the resolution , we make a huge smile , a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to hike in the Harz ( star )
the nation@@ wide &quot; star@@ path &quot; is to emer@@ ge in the Harz .
this plans of the association Observ@@ atory from St Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ path &quot; come to the information service of many har@@ ci@@ ences , called it .
he is binding , science , movement and physical power .
members want to exhibit along the planned route and inform about stars and stars about it .
during a first phase until the year 2018 , the association &quot; is planning a good operational installations of five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
inquiry about St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ iß and si@@ ber .
the information on the tables should be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
therefore , the site selection is a good mobile network .
Acc@@ essi@@ bility is also a criter@@ ion .
later the star@@ base path should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer will learn much about the history of knowledge , for example about the physics of the single stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars could have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although he is much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation I am a selected star ? and when he was the best .
the association has been active in the Berg@@ cities of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , the highest ob@@ serv@@ atory of Northern Germany .
according to the federal national park , the site is one of the six dark regions in Germany according to the federal national park .
frequently the Mil@@ ky Way galax@@ y are frequently visible from there and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ galax@@ y with their naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there have been something similar to the planet &apos;s support since 2003 on the initiative of the Supp@@ or@@ ship Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting in front of the har@@ har@@ ds hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , the planet route leads up to Hain@@ berg and ob@@ serv@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Gle@@ ichen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ mp with the individual planets - including the war@@ d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed P@@ lu@@ to at the end point - exactly are positioned at the end point and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks by a diameter of 6.5 milli@@ meters , while the sun measures exactly 75 meters away .
the entire distance of the planet is only four kilometers .
during the light of sun up to P@@ lu@@ to approximately eight hours , pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to stand with P@@ lu@@ to .
so many pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next f@@ using , but would last a half year .

Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; shooting chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is ho@@ ping to start at the end of 2 : 2 at the end of the season in Br@@ uns@@ wick to optimize the def@@ enses with Au@@ e Points .
with the first seas@@ onal play Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result , there wer@@ en &apos;t the two oppon@@ ents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; there were two oppon@@ ents too much , and we have to adapt to Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge the dirt chain is to be further optimized .
and a goal after a free lap , the Fort@@ unas don &apos;t want to catch more .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better now in preparation with the shooting chain , than with the ru@@ b chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite , however , that we are better toler@@ ated and we do not aff@@ ord such a lot of play errors . &quot;
of course Hoffmann runs to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; but if you talk after a draw from a mis@@ er@@ able start , don &apos;t know .
the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; but if we see on Sunday with four d@@ ots and we can concentrate on the cup , we surely will speak of a regular season open@@ er . &quot;
he wanted to know his train@@ ers .
&quot; I did not want to start the start into the season only after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not speak of an advantage over to Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in He@@ iden@@ heim had to be stopped due time because of a th@@ aw .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the player of Au@@ e might even could be somewhat fresh , because they couldn &apos;t have a serious and complete game like Fort@@ una could have gone into the bone .
&quot; but they do not know so 100 percent wher@@ ever they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner leader of the Fort@@ una .
we walk from the Rhin@@ eland as a little favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga that you had to beat in front @-@ beat , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Che@@ f@@ coach .
&quot; such a testimony would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ he@@ al . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers assessment tests
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were sub@@ jected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes the accuracy of this results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal products ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
they should be more precise during the grounds of the age after the Swedish mig@@ r@@ ations@@ n ( mig@@ r@@ ations@@ or ) because of errors in the evaluation of the correct age of refugees who were accused of age .
until today , the Migration Agency has sent 6,@@ 880 to the test@@ ament and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results from a total of 2,@@ 481 trials from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency approved that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 inst@@ ances , the conclusion was that the person is maybe under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is being question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been constant in recent months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been judged for over 18 years , does not mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has been lied about its age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it will take 442 cases that &quot; propos@@ e that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results , it was established that in 243 of these cases the person had said open@@ ly that they will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , being taken during X @-@ rays , and MR@@ I recordings of the kne@@ es , which then has been analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ olog@@ ists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a ske@@ p@@ ist ist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute whose work comprises the assessment of biological Re@@ es of humans to see whether they used to be earlier or later as usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about this , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used .
biological age to ass@@ ess that way is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could it , &quot; he told the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of testing : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult .
the greatest risk is in this case , if the person is less than 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are moving well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge on the eastern town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very well in time , it runs great , &quot; says Reinhold Le@@ icht , head of the department of road and traffic in the government pre@@ sidency Freiburg .
in April , work began simultaneously on all three re@@ habilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is intended for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a curved bridge made of concrete , which is lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come to the years .
to ensure the stability and transport security , the three components are thoroughly re@@ habil@@ it@@ ated .
the two other bridges lead about the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters respectively .
the bridge on the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 metre @-@ wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge connector on the northern side .
this is a stra@@ y version , which is also used as a operating path .
on the south side of the bridge a 2,20 meter wide bridge is to be used on Friday .
then the pe@@ de@@ strian wal@@ k@@ way should go .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company D@@ iz@@ wo .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge stages .

&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and they will eat him until the end of her life .
but I want to try out all , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart was quite open@@ ly about her Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality .
&quot; if I b@@ last in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Tw@@ il@@ ight &quot; collection Robert P@@ att@@ in@@ son who ultimately went up in bit@@ terly .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Bazaar , &quot; -@@ magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I &apos;ve got .
or do you think about , I have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten said that she had been bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived du@@ alism and believed in it .
so it has never been conf@@ used or ob@@ struc@@ tive .
I just never liked to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them she suffered from &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school times when they loved it like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
it really hurt me very in@@ ju@@ red .
when I was eleven , the children said , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , f@@ righ@@ tened and ash@@ amed .
now look back and think me : &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
they don &apos;t like to love their love life : &quot; people expect you to make you feel a certain way and an@@ no@@ ys me .

the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
if you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many pra@@ yers and much more memory ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the for@@ giv@@ eness broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump wrote a big announcement with the West Virginia rally before .
Mr. Tr@@ ump took West Virginia with 42 points , and justice did not stick the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
justice , according to For@@ bes , the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes den@@ ies that he owns coal min@@ ds in five states and have inher@@ ited a coal business from his father .

Co@@ E pra@@ ises the &quot; honest &quot; Russian accounting for D@@ oping @-@ Sc@@ andal
the world &apos;s global leader , Sebastian Co@@ e , believed on Thursday what he was as a manifest kid@@ n@@ apping from Russia to a D@@ oping @-@ Sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to go back to sport .
Russian Athletics Men &apos;s Chief D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IAAF World Championships on the eve of athle@@ tics world championships , that the ex@@ ile of his country was correct out of sport , and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
he said it to him for &quot; all athletes who were cut at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IAAF congress voted to uph@@ old the ban , that in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) , D@@ oping Agency has been found on state @-@ made D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF President Co@@ e said the re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized that it has experienced some hot days and everything will be possible to make sure the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; glad , &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to insert Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize the situation .
the principle was always convinced we wanted to separate athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; added
the n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will begin in the World Championships which begin on Friday in London , having a neutral global meeting .
the leader of the IAAF task force , Rune Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must ful@@ fill some of the criteria for a re@@ setting .
thre@@ ats tests are still in@@ adequate and banned train@@ ers are still free , he said por@@ ters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council .

Prime Minister We@@ il wants to rapid new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP prior to possible majority in Lower Saxony
the Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green govern@@ ance for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but he does not want to re@@ sign .
because on Friday , the Parliament &apos;s dis@@ solution for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens member in Lower Saxony was the government of Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the landing stage , the red @-@ green co@@ alition in Hanover lost their cre@@ di@@ ly one @-@ voice majority in Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the old Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ west organized her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in its election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
the CD@@ U @-@ Group Björ@@ n Th@@ ank would recommend his faction to absor@@ b them .
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relation was inver@@ sely .
the new Parliament will be on 14th January the next year .
Th@@ il@@ ler said that the red @-@ green country government must now decide whether they can continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
but Stephan We@@ il , however , holds it essential to conclu@@ de that the Parliament is willing to resol@@ ve its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further procedure on Tuesday .
the state version also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament uses the trust and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; our Const@@ itution offers several options .
these possibilities have to be checked leg@@ ally clean , &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler .
&quot; one will discuss all issues in peace when leg@@ ally tested leg@@ ally . &quot;
Th@@ il@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but a little bit around . &quot;
the polit@@ ician even st@@ ressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described as a successor in black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the decre@@ ed pu@@ ties for the return of their country meeting .
&quot; we are off of course , that she has received her land of land , with immediate effect , with immediate effect , &quot; said the pre@@ sid@@ ents of Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
the Group leader of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we would like to re@@ gre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ xt . &quot;
she decided not to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; also in front of the background we had no content difference , we cannot move forward to this step . &quot;
SPD parliamentary candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the re@@ sign@@ ation of the Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ xt into the CD@@ U as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behaviour of the former green @-@ de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ y@@ al of vot@@ ers and vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ y@@ al of Red @-@ Green , &quot; the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef of Socialists on Friday is written on Facebook .
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) , then to re @-@ choose the Land@@ tag .
the withdrawal T@@ west is the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
polit@@ icians &quot; in their last van@@ ity and in their fru@@ str@@ ation their personal interests in the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ izing the SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil .
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has contributed to this dirty in@@ tri@@ gel game and try to capital@@ ize political capital . &quot;
adult CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ traction f Björ@@ n Th@@ um@@ é wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to absor@@ b the life@@ jacket to the CD@@ U .
the Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed the v@@ ests to for@@ ge the outcome of the Congress in 2013 with a personal Car@@ ri@@ er@@ ed@@ ence .
the CD@@ U was then the SPD @-@ strongest force , SPD and green , but a very small majority in the Parliament .
the State of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gif@@ te@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discuss@@ ing slow eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumer protect themselves .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) Minister of Agriculture ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the ed@@ itorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speaking and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect eggs from poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encour@@ age consumer goods and consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator . check out the stamp of stamps .
the federal states of www.@@ c@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de covers the federal states most recent information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if everything we currently know , health haz@@ ard is generally excluded .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ers of the Federal Minister is not really perce@@ ived ?
food monitoring is the role of the federal states .
however , my house was immediately dead and is located since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s aff@@ inity with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are call@@ able for consumers .
trade has just like the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are per@@ me@@ able and health in@@ conce@@ iv@@ able .
if the resi@@ du@@ st@@ ine content of 0.@@ 005@@ mg / kg should be exceeded if eggs is exceeded .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time the fac@@ tories are not to be deb@@ ated .
seats out of production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , production lines meets no immediate fault .
rather , they must count on alle@@ ged illegal practices of service firms with economic damages .
as always there is a little control in the harvest .
do it l@@ acks only the staff or also on the concl@@ usive reasons ?
it was just the official controls which have covered the process .
however , in truth , food sc@@ ams and criminal energy can never be 100 per cent excluded .
just this is why a consistent view of these events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be pre@@ determined by decisive importance .
I have already done several times that I expect a frag@@ mentary en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment by the responsible authority .
is the regular alarm centre really needed at food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumer and consumers have the right to get used solely safe and convenient food .
if an in@@ valid in@@ sec@@ tic@@ ide is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to consumer .
by the gear@@ ing means manufacturers , dealers and consumers are going to move into a situation , which is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the law@@ suit action of in@@ sec@@ tic@@ ide Fi@@ on@@ ure must not be removable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this has to consistently worked rig@@ or@@ ously and with high pressure .
I &apos;m exp@@ ecting from all compet@@ ent authorities , that the atomic fact is quickly solved .
how the football rules of football on Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aims to prevent non @-@ inher@@ ited issues of European soccer players will not distur@@ b Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain , for which leads the leaders that the European game has super@@ vised the power , teams of access to the prestigious champion League tournament .
financial fair @-@ play rules , which were founded in 2011 by UEFA Cup , means that real time has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to purchase the Brazilian bikini from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a sal@@ ary that amount to ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to France .
real galax@@ y can make money to make the money , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring it into an galax@@ y of other stars , because of the financing of the teams through the energy @-@ rich mist@@ ress of Qatar .
clubs must use a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they must face the break @-@ even point in their business to the break @-@ even point in their business .
Mr. Michel Plat@@ ini was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini by his election on the UEFA President in 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P decreased from the concentration on the debt of the clubs on the supervision of their losses .
the change important that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then power@@ fully invested in order to build the team and to build a global brand - to be har@@ der .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , the club runs through the amount of EUR 30 million by 2018 .
although Plat@@ ini was fallen by the Pre@@ sidency of the Pre@@ gn@@ osis in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to re@@ side off from exc@@ essive editions .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; says Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA EURO FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the real @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has paid in a package deal , it may distri@@ bute the amount for the invoice over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five year contract with a five @-@ year agreement , so that it can be exp@@ elled to amount to EUR 4@@ 4.6 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City in 2014 , is hit by the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the real $ had a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later dropped to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEFA is in search of clubs that might try to over@@ take their financial super@@ vis@@ ing by companies who are linked by the owners of a clubs .
while a cat@@ ar@@ tic company could take the real PSG , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should exceed the default market rates , the UEFA would not be considered leg@@ itim@@ ate income .
it happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the F@@ PP@@ E agreed to the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the real @-@ time payments at Ne@@ ym@@ ar could be coming on payments by the 2022 World Federation Committee in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar in 2022 , Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Championship will be amb@@ assador and an absolutely man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEFA Rec@@ e@@ ats were to be found out .
the previous sanctions im@@ posed , that the UEFA will be more atten@@ tive , try to consider the rules .
UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PSG about Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , in the Thursday evening people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million has a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the final financial year will be published yet .
PSG expects Ne@@ ym@@ ars anticip@@ ate a blessing to sponsor @-@ De@@ als , Mer@@ chand@@ ising and Jersey sales .
the association anticip@@ ates that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ating , one of the best soccer players going to see , and it tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ars away trying to claim that it would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case from &quot; financed d@@ oping &quot; with the Club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS , in terms of cat@@ ar@@ ship , to the current owner of Kat@@ ars .
Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the rule of La Liga against a state to finance an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday .
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or different interests , if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;

&quot; with the current supplier chocol@@ at Frey , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
there are about 17 million small red @-@ red plastic bags up to 14 grams each year . each year the flight attend@@ ance passes the passengers to the passengers .
Swiss will not want to do any information about the cost .
industry &apos;s s@@ wis@@ s estimate the order volume according to the North West Bank , &quot; 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros subsidiary generates a yearly sales of approximately one billion Swiss francs .

how many applic@@ ants are available for the new call , Swiss will not want to bet@@ ray Swiss .
but there is only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to newspaper article , Chocol@@ at Frey aims to try out a renewal of the contract for spring 2018 .

as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ ody and a sal@@ es@@ per@@ sion of our Facebook @-@ enabled era .
but fran@@ chise feel it , the time would feel short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surpris@@ ingly well , not only because of his ab@@ sur@@ d hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking tin , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .

strike against Dr@@ ugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the Land
the police succeeded in taking a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis district , in R@@ ott@@ weil , Konst@@ anz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , were sear@@ ches through the public prosec@@ utor in Konst@@ anz , on Friday .
at the age of 25 , aged between 25 and 77 he was arrested and warran@@ ts issued warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the offici@@ als presented larger quantities of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two Ital@@ ians .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
all in all , more than 300 police officers were in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia organized drug criminal , heavy viol@@ ent acts , att@@ empt@@ ed murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
in the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office against the Organ@@ ized drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king in southern Germany has been established .
between the public prosec@@ ution in Konst@@ anz and Palermo , a real exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po R@@ ott@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the great deployment on Wednesday morning were also accompanied by four officers from Palermo .

ways compl@@ ains large g@@ aps in fore@@ ign@@ ers register
&quot; data from citizens who should not occur &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ igner stops in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings .
this lead to partly engraved wrong cho@@ ices for asylum procedures .
the responsible for refuge@@ e management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen way , has been atten@@ tive to a media report according to large g@@ aps in the country @-@ country regist@@ ers .
def@@ ect in the existing data could lead to asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; to partly engraved wrong cho@@ ices &quot; in a analysis given by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; .
according to the regist@@ ers , there are ten million people with foreign nationality , among them roughly 5.7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign country agencies in Germany .
because the data was not suff@@ ici@@ ently maintained , the data quality in parts have not been well maintained so far .
in isolated cases , data from 1921 found , &quot; of people who are no longer in life , or citizens of citizens , have become citizens of citizens and are actually no longer immer@@ sed in the register . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data can greatly slow@@ ed down , &quot; says the report to further .
in statistics on the date of travel people , the EU citizens are cap@@ tures , that do not have to travel .
such false positi@@ oner include , however , &quot; to a reported debate about dealing with excep@@ tions , &quot; means it is in the analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government shall seem to at@@ tract young families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they entered there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , the BA@@ MF lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , almost no longer possible , the newspaper enters the difficult situation in reference to the difficult situation .
following the Dublin agreement , the EU State is responsible for refugees who are at first .
when a mig@@ rant would reach another EU country , the state can send him back to the entry eland .
for the reason I am writing : &quot; the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
Italy have given for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ MR ) hold this supplement for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threat@@ ens deser@@ ted for defects in the Italian asylum system of human rights and health care . &quot;

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England will probably announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and slow@@ down inflation in inflation would have d@@ amp@@ ered over an increase .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth will remain &quot; la@@ zy as it kept by interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers of the Mon@@ etary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 for ens@@ uring interest rates to 0.25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened a rise in this month , since weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase in growth .
in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 % and in 2018 it would be able to continue the pressure on the household income , whereby the inflation in autumn is expected to rise to almost 3 % .
but it was necessary that in the next few years of interest income would be cultivated , inflation and it said that the credit cost is possibly more than expected to rise to financial markets .
the members also agreed to re@@ treat part of Mamm@@ ut &apos;s economic activity , which was published before a year after the re@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financial plan to deliver cheap financial means for banks , although it is expected that it is now expected to provide € 15 billion more within the scope of this system - with 115 billi@@ ons of sterling silver .
minutes after the decision on interest rate the bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ gn@@ osis of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real household of households continued to consumption the consumption . &quot;
at interest rates , they repeated that &quot; certain penalty of monetary policy &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger , &quot; extent necessary would expect .
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank emphas@@ ized that ex@@ plan@@ ations were called &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; .
the Bank &apos;s down forecast down@@ wards was forecast down@@ wards for this and next year , predic@@ ted to 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it sustain@@ ed its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell upon this news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth , increasing anticip@@ ated expectations of a pre @-@ rate rise and the GDP growth of 0.2 % in the previous three months has increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is expected to recover by the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusi@@ asm for households by increasing inflation and minor obe@@ di@@ ence , since the deep@@ ening is even worse before they are improved .
it also added that monetary policy cannot be prevent@@ ed in the next few years , &quot; but it added that wages to the end of their thre@@ ij@@ ah@@ re@@ gn@@ osis . &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , resulting in the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated for a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision proce@@ eds a year after lo@@ wering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU @-@ vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the P@@ fun@@ dia .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the final judgement of the Bank on interest rates , the call has risen to a interest rate , because inflation increased the pressure on a hard @-@ adjusted households , with three political decision makers in July increased an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation is reduced by 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was exp@@ ecting and will be back in the coming months .
the Bank said the exceeding in relation to its target of 2 % be &quot; completely &quot; the weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; due to the short@@ est return of sw@@ ap rates , the mort@@ gage market should even be more competitive and want to finish the year in a positive way .
the market particularly looks great for those who run existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are always popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Heal@@ thcare Service ) is to en@@ force 10,000 people with contro@@ versi@@ al HIV drug
from September following the high Court of war against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV pre@@ ven@@ tive treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse im@@ post@@ la@@ xis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) which can decrease the risk of risk in high @-@ risk provisions by around 86 percent , now estimated with a first three @-@ year @-@ study for estimated 10,000 people .
he stated to finance the trial , after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court of Justice , in which the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
the project announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS UK CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) .
sexual health clinics in London , Brig@@ h@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ position phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV pre@@ par@@ ates that are taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that the HIV transmission of infections in infections are significantly reduced .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to question of treatment are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners , which were not successfully treated successfully .
most people are identified by the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and register with a house physician can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexu@@ al@@ clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines that week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study aims to ass@@ ess the entire potential of pre@@ p by being conducted and implemented in large scale according to clinical evidence .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should comp@@ lement the far and increasingly successful efforts to re@@ comp@@ lement HIV and over@@ take .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades continued progress in t@@ ack@@ ling one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p when it is specifically aimed at risk and end@@ ang@@ ered people , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS co @-@ financed one in England will have to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and not with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives .
we welcome all this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be out that the study is quickly performed throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV .
now , since the pre@@ p test medicine was provided , we are on the best way to protect more than 10.000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ health minister , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is delayed by delay and delayed implementation by the government .
the evidence demonstr@@ ate how trans@@ form@@ ative that drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of pre@@ p benefits .
now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to help people inf@@ ects HIV @-@ infected so that we will contribute to the sp@@ reading of the spread of HIV in society .
the big life live : mezzanine and cle@@ ver@@ e designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , fell from a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge at Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it &apos;s on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before that I was living with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I looked after something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ce@@ il@@ ings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a qu@@ ered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to insert Jo@@ anne St@@ aur@@ aum and a mezzanine level to optimal use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to ce@@ ase high ce@@ il@@ ings , big windows , a lot of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill who was able to use 12.5 feet high ce@@ il@@ ings , not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ ground , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine level where you could stand .
a fan had to think to solve the pre@@ set .
&quot; the steel works is pretty complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange spaces so well that they were conf@@ ident that we had to b@@ ade us .
it was not only possible to build a simple platform , but on steel that he had to make the function up@@ ward or down the correct level . &quot;
this arrangement allowed it to place two rooms in full height - with plenty of additional drama .
a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can be seen on the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting place the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light .
in both ends , a short cor@@ ridor mir@@ ro@@ red in order to make him longer work .
in the kitchen the refle@@ ction feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the squares and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the per@@ c@@ eption of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
folding kit@@ chens are nothing new .
the most special thing is that it is a door element .
&quot; a bit engineer was going in , &quot; explains the fan of the steel strengthened , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it is counter@@ weight , so it is when you push the door , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne was able to win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says a fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate can occur and can perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor area , and at the same time use high quality materials , which provide the room its luxurious ind@@ ul@@ gence .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch , and therefore you can create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says it .
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself into the electric socket in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform themselves by a good design and increased square meters of somewhat cl@@ erg@@ y in something very amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide this not to leave .
brothers are fighting a real estate from 500 million US dollars
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ n@@ asty , in a con@@ front@@ ation because of one of the largest real estate ads in the value of more than 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and the developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this led him to the Supreme Court to clar@@ ify how their property and assets will be divided .
Paul wanted to with@@ draw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp meditation on the separation occurred in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 more than half a billion dollars were accum@@ ulated , since then the family purchased a business in the Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood , in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city centre of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the subur@@ bs .
after an agreement with her dece@@ ased father Col@@ in - von Paul is described as a &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s go@@ d@@ - and Paul is about one third .
the file was told that Col@@ in owns valu@@ ed at $ 316 million and Paul worth of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the &quot; proposed by Col@@ in proposed him with the background which I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an initial aff@@ id@@ av@@ it .
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court ruling took place last Friday .
the brothers are now strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - including Col@@ in , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Col@@ in argument , this is not true , but acc@@ epts Paul to manage some owners in@@ compet@@ ent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , submitted by Col@@ in , he says he is ho@@ ping to sett@@ le the disp@@ ute .
&quot; my Italian heritage also writes that the family is the most important priority &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , among them dol@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter k@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held the lawyers form .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants who run dairy bars and del@@ ic@@ ulture from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property in the Col@@ in which opened the family .
Col@@ in tells us that he began to see West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in the year 2012 , ho@@ ped , gave their property to ad@@ mit their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers &quot; land , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million .
Paul could be both Luke and Mark , so Paul tells about the conditions of their financial break@@ down . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept back very well , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and following a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; it &apos;s very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain and draw my family name by the dishes , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to ful@@ fill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father had@@ n &apos;t wanted to win Paul and I in our current disp@@ ute , &quot; he said and added that he was still in a solution . &quot;
the ho@@ pes all hope to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resol@@ ved in the near future , &quot; wrote Col@@ in .
the m@@ umps of new Stab@@ er@@ f plans to limit the media vote of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
POLI@@ TI@@ CO reported that the new Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - in hope to hold the b@@ oss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , presented to his first day of staff , he introduced a main problem to President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wants to repair : bad information that get into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis make sense , but others have tried to see Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media .
President Tr@@ ump relation to TV reaches for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its broad@@ casting is still strong .
&quot; when Candi@@ date was angry because of a un@@ fair report , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to POLI@@ TI@@ CO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , tr@@ umps &apos; hab@@ it consists of control , according to six former election campaign to ensure that his personal media consumption is an attractive praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that tr@@ umps has ever been &quot; under control &quot; was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
maybe those campa@@ igns know something we do not know - that tr@@ umps should not contain more combust@@ ible items without their inter@@ ven@@ tions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , which does not broadcast Tr@@ ump .
when his associates have made it a few times , trouble @-@ away from him , then their efforts paid off .
but nobody has consistently prevent@@ ed it that tr@@ ump caused cr@@ ack@@ ers .
a part of the problem consists in dealing with people in a White House , composed of comp@@ eting parties , bringing ever again to present their own Agenda by pro@@ ving cur@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
POLI@@ TI@@ CO - that deals with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of the advis@@ ors to inf@@ ect the president of strateg@@ ical reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane gold @-@ makers :
&quot; current and ex @-@ ump @-@ offici@@ als say that Tr@@ ump is acting as a volcano on negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , mainly such with damaged le@@ ci@@ ks , and that he would find out on it , from where they come from .
precisely that happened at the end of February , when som@@ eb@@ ody gave a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ocation , Charles C. Johnson , who described the source behind a he@@ ap to be at his at the White House .
although Johnson had been banned from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence that he has been ut@@ tered in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
gold @-@ em@@ aker added that the then Chief of Staff of Sen@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to capture and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same for three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still stri@@ ve for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make the &apos;s mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ rel@@ ish cri@@ min@@ als received post by Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is ho@@ ping and ho@@ ped .
the police in all of Europe sends mail cards in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on a dangerous crime on the run .
as the addresses of the requested gravity is naturally not known , references from the population will ho@@ ped and er@@ adi@@ c@@ ere .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action proposed by the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; season from winter .
experience have shown that many places could hide away from holiday villages , it &apos;s name to Euro@@ pol .
there have been compiled 21 postcards from 21 EU countries for broad@@ casting .
since 2016 there has been the site www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ende , which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online presence has so far been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the release on the website .
travel@@ ers negoti@@ ate over a grave and return back to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thy hom@@ e@@ owners of West Mi@@ dl@@ ands are once again negoti@@ ated with some ent@@ angled travel@@ ers , which tra@@ ded by the church in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their homes .
travel@@ ers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a we@@ al@@ thy road of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they have horses , babies , and an army of tran@@ sports , after they had been k@@ icked out in May , but have been de@@ ported from a council to prevent her acc@@ idents .
the tac@@ tic group found a gap in the defense buildings and pushed their vehicles by a section called the un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted way to find a way .
deser@@ ted residents drove the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it is &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They were going on Monday evening when they turned on from Bentley He@@ ath , where stones have thrown onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced into action by Sch@@ am to realize that he was us@@ eless to dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were there in May , then moved back and are now back .
more came evening , probably today more . &quot;
it added : &quot; the Inter@@ action of Birmingham white as you deal with it by taking long sub@@ missions to protect their parks .
I live on the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay to pay my local tax , if the Council can &apos;t stop once . &quot;
a local residents that didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this travel@@ ers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
the figures have increased this time and even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a female speaker of the Council of Soli@@ hull : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised dealer on the land beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ulls . we take the necessary steps to move it as quickly as possible .
to support our des@@ ires , it is very important that as many loc@@ als have been an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation , in which the court must consider when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Luise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Luise is located .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ gets is under@@ going renovation and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof on 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights were lost per year and also proce@@ eds by the local fee .
in autumn 2014 , in the presence of the increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the local district , hotel building was offered as a collection , which was provided for contro@@ versi@@ al discussion .
the town prevent@@ ed the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as hotel site .
the decision was not in@@ contro@@ versi@@ al at the same time .
but especially the Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Ober@@ bour@@ master Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel site and said already at the time of serious dis@@ interested in the house .
he should keep right .
the Group Lu@@ isen@@ hof , with CEO in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary turnover in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ ed object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s al@@ b .
you are welcomed hotel Luise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Luise and now Wald@@ hotel Luise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , for a longer time , building container is before the entrance , and when you enter the house , a vast renovation work will be performed .
the floors were torn out , ce@@ il@@ ings to be dis@@ man@@ t@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is much to do .
&quot; actually , it is a nice hotel , &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is speaking with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large enclosed showers , the input area is converted , it will be installed new windows .
everything that will be pretty close , just like Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewe@@ l out . &quot;
the swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
you won &apos;t be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level high level , emphas@@ ises we@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms have been rev@@ amped together , this Sch@@ erer is further .
both single vac@@ ations , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has led discussions with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Krause at the same time .
the performances of the city shall be the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not going to establish exactly .
just under a million euros , it is reck@@ oned .
the exterior plants are also placed on the front , which is already clearly visible .
in an inner courtyard a large terrace ar@@ ises from the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. special investig@@ ator awarded Grand Jury
in the Russian aff@@ air with U.S. president Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is meant to have a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
the Panel recorded work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to this cause .
the paper valu@@ ed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller is wid@@ ened and inten@@ sif@@ ying his investigation .
the CN@@ N transmitter reported that there is already first inv@@ it@@ ations of the committee in connection with a meeting between m@@ umps and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services acqu@@ ires the Kre@@ m@@ lin for longer , specifically aimed at the pre@@ sidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were inter@@ ference between Tr@@ ump campa@@ igns team and Moscow .
in the focus of investig@@ ations , several men are aimed at campa@@ igns of the Republi@@ can Coun@@ tries .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took private and more m@@ umps private and commercial environment under the magn@@ ifying .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special educ@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally presented the centre and the re@@ jection to dis@@ assem@@ ble the president in the course of the aff@@ air .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to consider and decide the evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether the charge should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called an indictment .
they are turned on when it is about bigger and contro@@ versi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always made behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by public prosec@@ ut@@ ors to download per@@ c@@ eption , by persons .
according to CN@@ N , CN@@ N stations have already been issued to shoot the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting , were asked for a statement , called it in the report .
you should also provide documents .
next to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump advis@@ ors and law @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his then his manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort was in conversation with Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
right wing said on Thursday evening in U.S. television , that the conf@@ id@@ ation show that Mu@@ eller could not be resol@@ ved in his work , and he if it should be necessary quickly .
but it is not in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably hot that the Grand Jury will be turned on in order to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the proce@@ eds of the committee of the beginning of a new phase into investig@@ ations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
among the new dis@@ closure , the President on Thursday evening disc@@ usses a speech in West Virginia to depic@@ ting Russia &apos;s aff@@ air as a campaign for his political oppon@@ ents .
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the issue give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they don &apos;t have anything else you can talk about that . &quot;
his special advis@@ or T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement , he kno@@ w@@ eth nothing from a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he st@@ ressed .
the White House wor@@ e any measures to acceler@@ ate the work of the special exchange at &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI chef James Com@@ ey said three times that won &apos;t be determined against the President .
one has no reason to accept that something was changed , called it in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired .
because of this re@@ bel was alle@@ g@@ ous against Tr@@ ump , he would like to hin@@ der the justice .
in June , Com@@ ey ex@@ changed in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for an employment of investig@@ ations against the former national security advis@@ or Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under large pressure due to the investigation .
after the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special investig@@ ator and its employees .
the dissolved spec@@ ulations of what Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller are relie@@ ved .
unlike an independent special investigation of the congress , such as in the Water@@ gate @-@ aff@@ air , Richard Ni@@ xon has caused a position to rene@@ w a position in which he might have fired on pus@@ hing the President of the President of the Justice of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of re@@ publi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators were dis@@ missed on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ator could no longer be released .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : huge Eis@@ berg moves in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tic a gig@@ an@@ tic ice@@ berg has solved the barely seven times in Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Bremer@@ haven Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the about a tr@@ illion ton@@ ne and 5@@ 800 sq km of the Kol@@ oss driver now drive to the north and will probably be two , three years until it was mel@@ ted .
it is a total of 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ice giant , the researchers have registered in the last three decades .
a danger for people do not expect from him .
to what climate change has played a role at the break@@ down of the Ice@@ ber@@ ges , it is clear after research ations .
however , the U.S. research centre for snow and ice cream ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a facsimile background for about 30 years , however , give an unusual collapse of ice cre@@ ations in the region .
according to many researchers , that could be related to warming .
the Kol@@ oss has now been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swimming in the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it is always growing up to the sea and leaves regularly .
Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is lies south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises was the balance of wax@@ es and dis@@ rupt@@ ing some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is broken down there , AW@@ I resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some evidence that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is at risk , because the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as pres@@ ently .
in addition , the ice plate stand under tension and can fall apart , in case of a key place .
the melt of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg will not increase the sea level as they stag@@ gered by water as much water as it gives after the melting itself .
however , loss of Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ ises leads to the gl@@ acier directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level but only in a low extent , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Midas ) .
according to AW@@ I data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest scar@@ city of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
on the junction from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , along the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; though there &apos;s a natural look and con@@ sci@@ ously aware of a direct link to climate change , the shield comes now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most popular re@@ treat since the beginning of records , &quot; he confirmed too .
&quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though this resear@@ cher dis@@ close this gig@@ an@@ tic Ice@@ berg don &apos;t decline to climate change , so many sh@@ ades of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen in recent decades .
this long time on Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends toward South America .
based on data from the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the Iron area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have passed 28 000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s .
at the decline of the temperature rise was contributed .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula was war@@ med about three degrees in the past 50 years , and counted towards the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to tar@@ iff domestic staff
because it is more difficult to occup@@ y free places , calls on the CD@@ U to get attractive to the employer .
just shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ mer@@ ie took part 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees work and offici@@ als working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have left their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are clearly cov@@ eted .
some 620 applications were able to record this year for this year .
non@@ eth@@ eless , the circle , however , lack of staff to cope with the demands and tasks .
currently there are at the M@@ ett@@ mann district after 50 not occupied places .
among other things , physi@@ ci@@ ans and engineers are the general administration .
the CD@@ U is now living together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG in partnership with the F@@ DP and the administration pris@@ oner in the administration .
the administration should develop a concept for personal gain and personal development after the request of the parties . &quot;
the aim is to provide not just short @-@ term thre@@ ats to explore , but to ad@@ option the application of applic@@ ants , it is called .
the overall concept should be oriented and on the outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ ups and an voc@@ ational offensive , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circuit has to do it with personal problems they do not know before .
other cities hire good civil servants and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
this will also make a high number of workers , the disease , or age @-@ related to the service .
the highest time for han@@ dic@@ raft , so that no longer vac@@ anc@@ ies will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , a leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request with his party .
he had already been back in the creation time for a poor surprise , as he public@@ ized the number of personnel open@@ ly in question and the remaining parties bl@@ oss@@ oms .
people would like to exam@@ ine that all options will be checked out of the municipal employer .
&quot; if we come here in short term to a satis@@ factory solution , the round@@ ab@@ oration with the unions must be in cooperation with the county @-@ members - perhaps , in cooperation with the county @-@ members . &quot;
this means the CD@@ U to pay the employees and offici@@ als better when it actually looks the T@@ ari@@ for@@ d@@ ation for public services .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ written , ex@@ plan@@ ations or more money , if one changes into a higher level , who is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have ever grown in the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be furnished in which employees take care of the conditions of the new pro@@ stit@@ ute protection law .
last but not least through the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Cir@@ cular director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy shar@@ pen@@ ed the tone to NGO mig@@ rants
Italy has NGOs that use life @-@ boats for mig@@ rants in the Mediterranean to war@@ n it not , if they are not able to continue to new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not have any new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how to continue working , &quot; said Minister Marco Min@@ ni in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came in a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of German aid organisation &apos; Youth Res@@ et &apos; , because their crew had worked closely with human tra@@ ff@@ ers in a way that immig@@ rated the illegal immig@@ ration .
the relief organisation which has been in operation only since one year , refused to express its Italian public prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us it is and remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization on social media .
&quot; we can judge all the acc@@ us@@ ations which are currently ex@@ alted , after we have collected all information and judge the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth Res@@ cue &apos; , super@@ vised the I@@ u@@ venta , since October .
it is assumed that his crew of inflatable mig@@ rants are delivered to them directly from men &apos;s hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can take up , thereby the ships can be used .
at least one such meeting of this project , only 1.3 miles before the Lib@@ yan coast took place , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents of Italian media was published .
the occupation is susp@@ ected of using the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , the life@@ jacket in the zone of humanit@@ arian reasons and not from any other Motiv@@ ation .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ venta must have access to Italian police officers who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessary but acceptable , because they wouldn &apos;t bring &quot; major changes or dis@@ abilities &quot; their life@@ work .
among those who refused to sign , the Nobel Peace Organisation for Doc@@ tors are established without bound@@ aries ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of mig@@ rants came back in Italy for the past few weeks , in recent weeks , the efforts to strengthen the strengthening of Lib@@ yan coastal defence and the collaboration with local citizens .
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister .
he gave up plans for more talks with Lib@@ yan people in this month about economic development community and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of mig@@ rants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
ascent and Tri@@ als
nine We@@ il@@ er@@ mer bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin &apos;s out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern part of the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights .
three friends are available for this .
the property in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Castle and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ kap@@ elle above De@@ id@@ es@@ heim .
it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which you could see far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the surrounding planes .
in between , there was always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day she went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Popular Wur@@ st Market .
the look@@ out point to the look@@ out spot , linked by &quot; flow@@ y &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days , there were again many elev@@ ations .
caves , rocks , towers , cast@@ les , ruins and reverse polar@@ ized breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim bre@@ ach the Bik@@ er in the open air @-@ inter@@ he@@ al Sole one .
Neustadt has been also headed .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had to know the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest of its best side - sporty and cul@@ tur@@ ally .
console instead of la@@ wn / le@@ ague is suitable for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in future be sitting before computer con@@ soles , instead of fighting the wind and weather about the adi@@ ans s@@ have ?
fact : E @-@ sport is long ago to a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - wide stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high gifts .
we recognized this was recognized by the first federal states that is increasingly involved in this field .
at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg won , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and most recently in the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid @-@ July an e @-@ sport department and two professionals took place among the FIFA World Cup 17 .
&quot; we hope this will insp@@ ire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
it is certainly to climb on this train even some clubs . &quot;
at the coming weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; to compete against the Gam@@ er of various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg were qualified , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen currently advis@@ es a agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; the real football , especially with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old know that young people will continue to enter into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : attemp@@ ts to tem@@ pt all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conqu@@ er .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men , one could have a presence in more often on these markets , when only once a year , the federal structure returned to Asia .
what are it exactly ?
with the e @-@ sport games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or FIFA , the Football @-@ Simulation are challeng@@ ed at competition level .
long ago , as in normal sport , the professionals have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .
and for Asia play , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a correct sports ?
for many , the idea is sure to be used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ial has left himself a long time with the question .
for Professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sports because he is compet@@ iti@@ ful and many biological and physical reactions which you can also find heart rate frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also need cogn@@ itive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick re@@ ven@@ ess .
professional gam@@ er should not only exercise in the console but also exercise their body and take care of nutrition .
&quot; the best player is a good player . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ ial doesn &apos;t see problems : &quot; D@@ oping is getting more on a theme . &quot;
controls are difficult at online games , and in the scene there were the structures of classical Sports .
the scientists prove positive impact on the E @-@ Sports field .
the players are international roads , this is like a global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study of the consult@@ ancy between Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federation of Inter@@ active maintenance software ( BI@@ U ) does not say rapid growth ahead of the E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , more than 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly about advertising , spon@@ sor@@ ship , and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
with about 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga , this is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writing the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the U.S. , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and bas@@ eb@@ all star Alex Rodrig@@ u@@ ez were involved in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in e@@ Sport @-@ competition Un@@ ik@@ r@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching , says F@@ rob@@ ial .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer match is oblig@@ ed according to D@@ utt , in the meantime required to set up a e @-@ sport part .
&quot; in the European comparison Germany , V@@ f@@ B Executive Board explains Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nost@@ alg@@ ia fall , and the old times are too hor@@ rified , this is no longer sufficient .
therefore , it is possible to keep the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time as a modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; you cannot hold fast , that only when football remains so , as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter found because of the texts , mur@@ dering Conrad &apos;s Roy To su@@ icide
a woman from Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encour@@ aged her boy@@ friend to su@@ icide and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence after alle@@ ged and five years were exposed to local currency .
Carter was convic@@ ted in June due to a rapid killing of Conrad Roy , who took the life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ separ@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free until calling .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representative argument that she suffered from psych@@ ic illness .
in red trousers and a cream coloured blo@@ use , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when they was condemned .
&quot; her actions have taken Conrad &apos;s Roy , &quot; said the public prosec@@ utor in the court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has taken no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ er said att@@ or@@ ney , it is a &quot; aw@@ ful passage that they totally re@@ gre@@ t . &quot;
judge Lawrence Moniz said , he did not find that her &quot; age or tyre , or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lynn Roy , who said it , &quot; there is no day that I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and as I go with everything . I try to be able to bear with all my pain , which we will be for etern@@ ity with us for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ u@@ dyn Roy said that it will be persec@@ uted by the real@@ ization &quot; to participate in the wedding of her brother or would be an ante for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be an illegal prec@@ ed@@ ence , since there is no law in Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts , which makes it a crime to commit su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case with@@ drew national attention on himself , after car@@ ters revealed texts that they had encour@@ aged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moment ahead of his su@@ icide they wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad , and &quot; everything you &apos;ve got to do is the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
Richter Moniz said that Carter acknowled@@ ged attention through the death of Roy and ordered it to profit from any press to the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
to the few , the Carter def@@ ended , belonged to Am@@ anda Knox , who was convic@@ ted for murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy before two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter &apos;s sympath@@ y and help , no prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i , at the Audi Cup , was actually no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern tri@@ mm@@ ed the Conf@@ ed Cup winner a great season - extra motiv@@ ation seemed not there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which looked Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing is very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer has been seen , he made himself a hur@@ ry to his arm .
&quot; the trainer never announced it , &quot; told the Conf@@ ed Cup winner after his first use as Bayern @-@ Kapitän .
good , the one could have better run than at 0 : 2 vs. SS@@ C Naples .
but K@@ imm@@ i could interpre@@ t the sign of Coach .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants , and just chosen by the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as game guide , but he .
sugar is considered at the best to those who wants to keep a lot , who wants to keep you in the mood .
so who was chosen to enter the L@@ ame of Lah@@ m , a small extra motiv@@ ation can only use a little extra motiv@@ ation .
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want to do as a player . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old served as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right back , that &apos;s his position , the white bin@@ de on the arm put its evil .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i played in this start@@ information like the one who can take the ru@@ der also best in his hand .
he gave orders to direct the un@@ r@@ ins@@ ed tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole , while many others were busy himself .
Vid@@ al to re@@ play his missing Fitness ( d@@ ashed hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the dev@@ ils desc@@ ending on the achie@@ vements of Asia @-@ travel ( it &apos;s also con@@ ditional ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Nik@@ las Sü@@ le thus did not fall negative in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ kot .
this still worked out very well .
in addition to K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y slept in front of the defense , both ag@@ ates so@@ vereign .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to grow a few times in the game @-@ up .
his colle@@ ague Rud@@ y gave to say that the result was &quot; not as we ho@@ ped ourselves . &quot;
but he showed a good performance in the debut .
game settings , change : &quot; for this style I was also reco@@ ver@@ ing . &quot;
as usual , this Bayern world is still for new ad@@ ditions , one saw in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y to the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determin@@ es six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cr@@ ack@@ ling statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of the south an interesting pro@@ position : &quot; which desc@@ ends here , I have already noticed .
you just have to win each game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the New Team .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ car@@ ing ministers : Economy lo@@ aves W@@ iss@@ ings pace
the relationship between the country and regional economy is often st@@ amp@@ lified , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was an economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself according to more than one year , where the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V Inqu@@ iry for a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old min@@ istri@@ es .
Frank N@@ atus , president of the association Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the des@@ ires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt has blocked . &quot;
the largest swe@@ eping reflec@@ ts in the Infra@@ structure policy : the close proximity to the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
in this year , the ministry is ho@@ ping for a planning process , until 2021 the device is supposed to stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western direction of Trier , which is required in the urg@@ ent need of the Federal Rail@@ ways .
the aim is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ Cur@@ ator Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
in it , N@@ atus shows a sign for local , but internationally comp@@ eting companies .
the Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier will stri@@ ves to increase the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase the sales of super@@ markets in super@@ markets and stop the trend in the exports of Germany for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to establish a firm , the I@@ HK .
the new Master Bonus of Trier will see an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Schw@@ alb@@ ach .
a reward of 1000 Euros is planned for the master@@ ing of 1000 Euro , when gradu@@ ates within ten years after the Master &apos;s education to make it self @-@ read@@ able .
but the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains however .
at the planned road construction we can quickly create facts , at the same time , the country lack@@ ed staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , the managing director of the I@@ HK Trier .
only 29 places has been occupied by 56 new engineers to emplo@@ y knowledge in the country &apos;s local business .
the I@@ HK claims to be awarded with orders to external offices .
as a result , CD@@ U @-@ Group vice @-@ out Christian Bald@@ auf refers to the calculation of the bill in 2017 and by 2018 , more than 20 million euros invested more in receipt of country roads as proposed .
Frank N@@ atus still expects a concept of the country to make use of skilled business in the region .
consequently , the old broad@@ band extension is also in the country .
in 2016 , the regional company had only rated the supply of power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the Note 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ ings and out@@ breaks .
the Swiss Prime Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Tur@@ bine Pro Wind .

Audi should change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ aker be con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction
one day prior to the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ Chair , the company , said that &quot; there is smart options that &quot; there are smart options , &quot; and therefore attracted to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles can be ver@@ ified or restri@@ c@@ ible .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
one of the firms described the enterprises as a call@@ back .
European auto manufacturers have greatly encour@@ aged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the ad@@ her@@ ence of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ it diesel engines , apply as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and may cause as@@ thma .
the cost of automobile manufacturers , equipment for the neutr@@ alization of the exhaust gases to be installed , also accept what it makes difficult to competitive the price of cars .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused to ign@@ ore the mighty car companies and ign@@ ore the signs of the problem .
the company try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices to regul@@ ate the regulations when a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions .
several employees were charged in the United States , and others were investig@@ ated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engineering development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be placed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investig@@ ations in Volkswagen , after the authorities have tried to implement a system in order to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States .
the incl@@ usion of Audi in the study could provide Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturer transm@@ its propor@@ tional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ oses and the laughter against the g@@ rief
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most widely published cartoon illustr@@ ator , the Kn@@ oll@@ es of his figures are its trademark .
also with 85 the nor@@ th@@ ier is still working and working on a film .
his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he spread among other things as a drawing of congrat@@ ulation - which fru@@ str@@ ates him .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
following stops in Lima , New York and Paris followed the end of the 1960s , with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
the artists of cities have always been inspired by the artists .
big , round@@ ish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures gather in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , his information is still sitting at the Dra@@ wing table , working every day almost ten hours .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches still find a lot of spread worldwide .
he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series for six years .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a Giraffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los favourite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as a counter@@ part .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should open to the chin wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he is foc@@ uss@@ ing on the TV series , which will be produced on how his original drawings .
lav@@ ender being threatened with Provence from climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .

Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the field research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence has been effectively end@@ ang@@ ered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which resulted in a lot of rain in the spring and much more .
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small co@@ ag@@ ade , a bacter@@ ium that carries the d@@ warf , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
lav@@ ender oil does not only succeed for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also in demand for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or missing .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to ensure that they are considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .

killing of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet usually with Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt civil servants and in@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of her own trag@@ edy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists who feel saf@@ er to saf@@ er : they are supposed to take their children in the office , which were in 2009 the target of a attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or at home .
security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the space : opponent , neutral , alli@@ ed .
you ask the re@@ porter , names for each column - no proof is necessary to submit per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal feelings .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , polit@@ icians , business people , journalists who are susp@@ ected to stand on the housing list of the Government or the Kart@@ ing , a catalogue of crime , making the chaos of Mexico .
there are no rest@@ ing rest of violence , and throughout the country the bodies of the bodies , there are always more journalists : at least 25 years since the president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto gave up his office . 5@@ 89 they have been on state protection and so far there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is the editor and their inspiration of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , and Val@@ dez wrote in one of its numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
his absence is felt deep , though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; depic@@ ts on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ building . two re@@ porter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ ire@@ z , carry t @-@ shirts , which will show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter discussed about their shared issues , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
while in 2010 , a son@@ ata &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney was established to process the cases of journalists , according to the committee , it was initiated by two criminal proceedings .
as with the majority of thousands of murder , every year with drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king and organised crime , the mur@@ ders of journalists are rarely issued before the court .
with Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although it is un@@ easy , although the terrain is still more av@@ eng@@ ed .
without any information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting is a little benefit of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very st@@ up@@ id to wear my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we do not . &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the country &apos;s capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla had to be stopped by two men . he was shot and sentenced to him for 12 time , probably due to the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; 12th . &quot;
the cap went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
s@@ caff@@ ol@@ ding tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is virtually nothing in the topic of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans has been arrested in the United States last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val@@ er@@ ating fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
there &apos;s nothing to be shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day or more people shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of ench@@ anting , two @-@ story maus@@ ol@@ ean for drug might that are larger than many houses for the living .
just forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with valuable har@@ bo@@ urs and drugs @-@ trading companies in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dang@@ ers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt he was not for@@ tified to his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ standings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ed ant@@ it@@ rust fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have an@@ no@@ yed the sons , probably the sake of the edition received as soon as they delivered to newspaper k@@ is@@ ke .
the second fault lay in that Val@@ dez was not win@@ dy up , after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of another newspaper , who had published the same story , the country too his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long been living for his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
he served as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined the establishment of five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold for 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without saying anything to the boot@@ lo@@ om problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
at the time the newspaper had a reputation because of the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenue .
re@@ porter loved it to publish hard tre@@ ff@@ ing studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories , that nobody had to deal with .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage during the persec@@ ution of the Mexican drug history , wher@@ ever they lead them .
he volun@@ tar@@ ily gave him that he had trouble .
&quot; I would like to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
Ein@@ tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October .
&quot; you must take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ my .
I did not want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the so many things ... why did you not say what went ahead ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who cur@@ se the fun , the friend who was generous with h@@ ugs and hits , a teacher , who knew how to survive .
they tru@@ sted to his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always go to El Salinas , the bar opposite the office , and there always sit on the same table .
now ask them : was his love for routine become a routine ?
his death also forced them to question their own concerns about how they do best and keep up their work .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their proper start@@ - and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a great measure of self @-@ interest and self @-@ keeping .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is wrong , where@@ ab@@ outs of it away .
the anger is said the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be dece@@ ived ... and then the thing is with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as it and other words , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a , no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Guer@@ r@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative dirt roads , weak institutions and corrupt government offici@@ als at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the members of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones required . days before it was known that Spy@@ ware is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activ@@ ists in Mexico .
two police officers tried protection outside the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the local government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a central area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in j@@ est , some of the re@@ porter asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who described the governor himself as not tru@@ sted .
it is for months , since the re@@ porter has gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug abuse has been fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce made up three main stories .
there was an ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of the brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
you also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending that concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group that wander@@ ed in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from office of the office building , an ab@@ duction .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped , so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone in town : that the restaurant is a favorite local group of drug tra@@ ff@@ ers and offici@@ als .
re@@ por@@ ters learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , which ruled the ruling Inst@@ itutional revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors have been accused of corruption due to the high @-@ class cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real beg@@ ged the re@@ porter , writing about previous inc@@ idents in this eating one , including one that passed into a military attack by &quot; El Chap@@ elle &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man .
just a few months earlier the reader mentioned the column of Val@@ dez as the best inform@@ al source of the ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its slim body st@@ ature .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers , dedicated to the mur@@ ders by journalist , because the employees have become something of what they had never expected : activ@@ ists in the name of the press .
Mr. Mi@@ riam Ram@@ ire@@ z sn@@ ap himself a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to visit the office of the district .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and official announ@@ c@@ ements , based on DNA tests that it &apos;s its .
throughout the country , journalists were loud and written by the &quot; SOS Press &quot; prot@@ ests in organized prot@@ ests .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ ire@@ z accused the authorities to compens@@ ate and destroy them , because they have said the truth .
it has since been asked since it is dealt with by the government , because it is concerned that their rage has in@@ ju@@ red its objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez was repeat@@ edly said that journalists in Mexico had been organised by organised crime to inter@@ govern@@ mental government offici@@ als and a con@@ tribut@@ able society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote not only to be killed by drugs , but also on the command of polit@@ icians and security forces that were with the organized crime under a blank@@ et .
the media group group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; added more than half of the attacks against journalists of police and offici@@ als last year .
&quot; in Mexico you will die , because you would like to hold the mouth , &quot; Ram@@ ire@@ z said .
obviously the mur@@ der@@ ous effect have an ab@@ err@@ ent effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in northern borders of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kartell , &quot; I am because of my reports . &quot;
there is a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to conclu@@ de like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern State of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua , after the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to continue like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly exhibited the drug @-@ cart@@ els with a title page on the title page &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled out of their home country or even from country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in ex@@ ile and still watch the streets and seek dang@@ ers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted and obviously the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who together with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z was murdered .
for those who continue their stay and continue , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , gives him that the drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king him .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell and so I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the ed@@ itors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce re@@ started on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank of beer when all her tele@@ phones were started .
a number of sh@@ ale measures with band@@ en@@ ri@@ val@@ en and security forces near the spa centre Maz@@ at@@ lan had left the dead .
the war es@@ cal@@ ated , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the border st@@ ony they published their news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front@@ page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ w near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez designed a look at the police officers , to see whether they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose Mid@@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the members of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its marks .
&quot; as you can only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day when Javier was murdered , the intern called me for about to send them back to the road . &quot;
Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue , when a ter@@ rif@@ ying day .
now , researchers have found that the first findings of the un@@ belie@@ vable r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros are so well received that experts have described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
it was so good that she could even identify that his scal@@ y skin was brown - and they said , it could have had something from an un@@ troubled past . &quot;
the report on the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; called it as &quot; the preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s spec@@ im@@ ens of the world . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the Kre@@ ms time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserv@@ ated condition , researchers that describe it as a &quot; truly remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the Ar@@ mo@@ red plant resource is the best preserved Fos@@ sil in its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , as he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that seemed from the surrounding cli@@ ff lack@@ ed in Plat@@ ze , and decided to look at more precise .
Fos@@ sil discovered it was sent to the Royal Tyr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild be@@ ast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) of heavy cru@@ de wr@@ ens .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; when you bl@@ ink only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was not slept . &quot; said the main au@@ tor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyr@@ rell Museum where the cre@@ ature has to be seen .
&quot; it is going to enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s - the Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant pre@@ iv@@ o@@ res , though it is covered with an arm@@ or , with a changing bre@@ ast@@ plate , probably threatened by me@@ ats of din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ouflage in order to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used as a shield , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix himself better in its surroundings , and say to its enemies , say , what indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has been head@@ head@@ lines in May and is now shown in the Royal Tyr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology in May .
researchers now have studied the wild be@@ ast and it was called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ Engine@@ ers Mark Mitchell , one of a team who gave more than 7@@ .000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preser@@ vation of the car enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of drag@@ ging and arm@@ our to his body .
they discovered the ch@@ at@@ ment , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the cre@@ ature has been dar@@ ker than its bottom .
although the form@@ at@@ ment is common , the results are surpris@@ ingly , because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the survi@@ vor@@ s of the living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by eating me@@ ats in din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that evolution was favorable to over@@ coming the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the conc@@ ub@@ ines - think of Re@@ he , Ze@@ br@@ as or Gür@@ sh@@ tiere - are much smaller and vul@@ ner@@ able than pre@@ y what sign@@ posted that this No@@ dos@@ sier was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; strong spac@@ ecraft behaviour on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s must have been the cra@@ b time , &quot; Brown said .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ ine was red .
scientists will continue to investig@@ ate the animal on critics of his life , including its conserv@@ ative Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s died when he died , into a river , and pushed out into the sea , where he sank into the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was like southern flor@@ ida today , and rivers and oc@@ eans probably spread much more in@@ land than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with a preserv@@ ated skin , but it remains in three dimensions and preserved the original form of animal welfare . &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early creation time .
you don &apos;t need to use much imag@@ ination to con@@ struct it . if you &apos;re only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the creation time was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ ods , de@@ hydr@@ ation din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who rose on two legs , ground up the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ os@@ aurus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ opo@@ el@@ ta lived , the arm@@ oured din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by some of his ter@@ rif@@ ying ancest@@ ors .
in addition , the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ aurus belongs to a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy mon@@ sters .
the scientists , whose most recent findings in current biology appear to believe that Bo@@ real@@ opo@@ el@@ ta turned out after the death in the sea and m@@ um@@ ified in the mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , as he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the preserved Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle until ch@@ ump .
the creatures were weigh@@ ed on average for about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pound ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops , which rag@@ ged by its shoulders .
the researchers think that the arm@@ oured cro@@ ps were swe@@ eping across the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the under@@ water imp@@ lic@@ ation of the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ riers con@@ fron@@ ted its arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ rified wood remains of this special edition is so good that the skin remains still cover hol@@ pri@@ ge car@@ ap@@ les along the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ ante
like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ vation is as rare as a profit in the Lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it will .
resi@@ zed Re@@ sts of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y car@@ ap@@ les , which carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
his right @-@ foot is lying on his side , his five fingers are spread up .
I can count the she@@ ds at his sole .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass@@ acre on A8 : many in@@ ju@@ red
he@@ ft@@ y accident on Thursday night on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass@@ acre .
there are lots of in@@ ju@@ red , kilomet@@ ers@@ - and bar@@ riers .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , some 20 people were in@@ ju@@ red during the late afternoon afternoon .
according to the first data , the police were against 17.00 o &apos;clock in the junction Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( local district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm , almost 30 cars , including probably lor@@ ries , slo@@ ped .
no data is given to the exact number of recent developments .
it is a light to moderate injury , a police officer said .
a great asc@@ ended to rescue vehicles was in the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in Munich .
in the direction of Munich , there was a ten @-@ kilometer long rear st@@ au .
like a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it also appeared on the back @-@ track to massive dis@@ abilities - by numerous bar@@ riers .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched the number of vehicle len@@ ker , which now have been reck@@ oned with sensitive criminal charges .
shortly after 18 : 45 I took a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and W@@ ases .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transport and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has wit@@ ness@@ ed at least : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a great thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
will the she@@ er and w@@ akes an impro@@ per or ride the ride in the middle of the work@@ flow .
chassis control .
but the times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are over soon .
the German railway currently tested the map sheet monitoring .
just approved by phone that you can take its place and take advantage of the ticket .
currently , a trial run on two routes .
&quot; is the offer , we &apos;ll expand it from .
in the beginning of the year , it is expected to be available on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; said an train speaker .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the path card de@@ valuation without she@@ ep@@ tions .
in order to use them , however , some conditions have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and one must have booked an online ticket - what should most of the passengers do already .
you have also to have purchased about the App , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient method of ticket booking .
and at last you need a seat .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as : one climb@@ s into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; .
during the test customer , a button will appear on electronic valid@@ ation .
the tractor leads to your mobile devices such a message that bikes X is on the train and took the booked seat Y .
if the ticket control room has reached number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already purchased online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue , keep on .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail , which is to be util@@ ised in the passenger .
&quot; those who want to travel without ticket control through our permission team does not wish to travel in the DB Navigator .
this enables passengers to create their journey on the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing executive board of DB .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to deal to the individual customer needs . &quot;
who often travel , knows that next to delay and missed lines the ticket controls are among the largest off@@ ences .
for often , in any case , one of the Mit@@ reis@@ enden is not all necessary documents which you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either a credit card or the ID card or a document there must be required .
the result is endless discussions between the companion and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part@@ itions or large @-@ space and del@@ ays in control of their own tickets and will take care of the workers at the end of the time .
even , only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and that is only available on the joints of ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart .
other train features on the same route are not yet un@@ locked yet .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to her core on 9 August 2014 .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the child sitting in St. Louis , on the bed of a air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented it and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post of som@@ eb@@ ody from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and there still is still on the street . &quot;
conf@@ used , because nobody else had posted information on her feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saving on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old man who was killed by a white officer in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was live to twe@@ eter .
he posted a picture of bro@@ wns that was stretched out on the road and had to stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; said Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she finished her cell phone , later to return to Twe@@ et via people on Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police and people that cried out , and of a man who claimed to be a shield with the in@@ scription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed an live feedback , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with an inver@@ ted dog .
in another video said she , as@@ sured another polic@@ eman , his rif@@ le , and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; all of you will kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell &apos;s remember@@ ing her say@@ ings .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ om@@ ed to us and which we can call . &quot;
at that moment , I felt bow@@ ls .
I was angry and we@@ eping . &quot;
it booked a return trip and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive on the next morning after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the topic of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survival and prot@@ ests , the love and power of power , which exists in fel@@ lowship and power of resistance , which live in fel@@ lowship and streets , to ask answers .
as a Fer@@ rel with her daughter , wor@@ shipped a fl@@ oral design and a suitable crown , after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had count@@ less times in this morning , &quot; about black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember what I have taught you when black people have to fight in what they believe ? &quot; they remember@@ ed what she said .
&quot; we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police had a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
I couldn &apos;t say it , &quot; Fer@@ rell later said .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and pulled it up .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves .
even if I have a fort@@ une to give her a experience in which she doesn &apos;t have an ec@@ lat@@ ex rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black female child .
I feel that I would have a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
the first station , when it arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a town opposite the police station which was built to a camp site , when the activ@@ ists wa@@ ited for the impossible not @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped them to transfer them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism started to take shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has completely changed after 9 August , &quot; said she and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Miss@@ ouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ toral association and focused on food and health in@@ equ@@ alities in black con@@ greg@@ ations .
&quot; I had no experience in the organisation .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met in the evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar decided only to document what happened .
a question occurred Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; would you document or try to find a story you can take out ? &quot;
this ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by count@@ less cases of people , often of inc@@ ense - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who have been born and raised in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and have not cent@@ ered their voices and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artist from the area called for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt Ne@@ eds .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell to the project , along with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose tro@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talk to us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; this was the main thing for me as these people will be presented , for I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surpris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls lives as she mar@@ ries and married their wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understood that there must be certain vul@@ ner@@ ability in this work and in the pur@@ ification of black people . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls history repeat@@ edly wins the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ L@@ ives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of movement , who have strongly influenced the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black Teen@@ agers in 2012 .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement together , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and thus we are constantly fighting at various fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
the Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remember that &quot; the movement is truly held by black women and many black women . &quot;
it is , however , that &quot; this is not a aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rell has been selected as a heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who raised her energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although it was on the front front , because at these cru@@ ises than a black , gay woman stands so much on the game .
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
the news from Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has already disappeared , but the rac@@ ial links between the community and the police are still standing .
Fer@@ rell has at local currency for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls their home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
however , she felt at an voice and she feels committed to this memory , since three years ago it went to the street in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ aw@@ k@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ Reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they are not built .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pe@@ de@@ strian zone have out@@ dated the population in so@@ vere@@ ign@@ ers and oppon@@ ents .
cold the subject hardly leaves a cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while those of a bit say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) , &quot; comes from the other side : &quot; no man does not need &quot; ( Sig@@ gi band@@ ing ) or simply : &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
while the adv@@ oc@@ ate is designed to lay out a gallery more clients into the city , whatever the other shops , fear the opposition , that then the pe@@ de@@ strian prec@@ ip@@ ts are explo@@ ited .
additionally , the gallery is planned to be exactly on the property where the market hall is in the 13 direct selling its products .
at the beginning of construction work will be concluded .
the Gallery paintings want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely the Bed@@ a square with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the market market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm have always been very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher for us too .
we would wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also that .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if a direct mark in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of rent .
but it could probably not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; for what shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , foot@@ wear , drugs or super@@ markets : I think it is un@@ necessary .
there is already enough in our city .
you see how many shops are empty here - some since months and years ago .
however , since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is so important that at least keeping us the market hall .
for at least the mer@@ chand@@ ise is fresh , mainly offered directly from the product and is in@@ suff@@ ici@@ ently at the price .
as one sees , shop business will be rented in a shopping m@@ all only by larger companies because the les@@ ions are often not trag@@ eous for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special transactions exists almost no more and what is still left , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the market hall be throughout the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it already create the g@@ hosts program before exp@@ el all the business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not going to work .
and a shopping center which is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ p@@ ale market , there is no place thanks to the w@@ ac@@ ute many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
when the market hall is head@@ quartered , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ ar@@ ity : artist gets portra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ strange - those are connected to cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portra@@ its have been created by the artist He@@ ather Dec@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ side and hair@@ cuts , which were sent to you by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former intelligence was served as a 35 year @-@ old prison sentence after they opened as a home in dipl@@ omatic announ@@ c@@ ements on W@@ iki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ ar@@ ity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipl@@ ine was to be transformed into technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ ine and a pion@@ e@@ ering dis@@ sident , when he was only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which was extrac@@ ted from Mann@@ ing , and from the 30 portra@@ its could not only look like som@@ eb@@ ody , as it can be interpre@@ ted and the in@@ firm@@ ament Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , which was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but since its pu@@ ber@@ ty was said open@@ ly about the identification as a woman , it was found in 2013 because of 20 charges against the sp@@ y network , computer workers and the@@ ft .
through the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only one single picture - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting in the man sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum blonde is associated with that it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just back from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; St@@ ran@@ ger VIS@@ IO@@ NS &apos; .
in it , the artist portra@@ its of stran@@ ger ar@@ tif@@ ici@@ des from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like c@@ andy store and che@@ wing gum that they extrac@@ ted DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people might look like .
this was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg stated at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not attend this time and could not take pictures , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained mice were to un@@ equal letters that ex@@ changed several letters during the course of two years .
they even looked at one of Sho@@ ili &apos;s can@@ ung@@ o illustrated Comic &quot; Supp@@ ression images &quot; which would pre@@ di@@ ct a future where the president of Chel@@ seas would be able to see the show personally .
in fact , Obama truly became a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing was asking for seven brutal years in a military jail in Kan@@ sas so it was a welcome way of happy meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now on the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads to war fighting and against Trans@@ gender troops to avoid the rigid split , which he really ought to stand further .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the we@@ ir@@ d tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things could happen for a specific reason . &quot;
in a particular name written in the gallery in the gallery , the man called for the man@@ ing with its vast signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic break@@ down , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written a thousand fo@@ oth@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg allows you to show the incl@@ usion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed academic dictionary of the artist ) , as amazing , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take of hope that we are not just car@@ ing who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jec@@ tive they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , their video work of 2007 , Spur@@ ious Mem@@ ories , can also be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that are 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the mentioned Comic Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerg@@ es with a free phone , in the hand of the United States , like King Kong .
&quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech , then they won , &quot; it says .
&quot; it &apos;s never simply the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist you gre@@ et from Philadelphia .
&quot; I still keep go@@ ose if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was predic@@ ted in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ac@@ ons , like hor@@ des of prot@@ est@@ ing .
that was also target@@ ed as everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings st@@ ature ) , with h@@ ap@@ h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portra@@ its .
&quot; I wanted it feels like a mass movement that feels to Chelsea like the movement , which also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nation@@ wide human j@@ ag@@ d is under@@ way Professor at North@@ western University and a employee of the University of Oxford , which was chosen as susp@@ ects in a luxury apartment in Chicago , with dead@@ ly in@@ jur@@ ies .
on Monday the arrest warran@@ ts were issued on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) , because of its alle@@ ged invol@@ vement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the District Court of Cook County were showing .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several b@@ ull died .
a research system published by the Chicago authority was reported that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
offici@@ als received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found victims with several in@@ jur@@ ies to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the site of the events for dead , and investig@@ ating the stit@@ ches as a murder while the police are actively sought after the two susp@@ ects .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em has been appointed professor of Micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for University Relations , said in an E @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em has now been decre@@ ed and ruled by the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal aff@@ air that is investig@@ ated by the compet@@ ent authorities and nor@@ th@@ western University cooper@@ ate at this examination , &quot; said Cub@@ an .
War@@ ren is Senior Tre@@ as@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the Police in Britain in contact and ready to help us to help us the US Invest@@ ig@@ ations . &quot;
the testimony added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to sur@@ render .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demanded the susp@@ ects to question the authorities .
&quot; the police has a vision of her ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ ate them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects .

&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published a declaration to the residents : &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and in the background of the victim &apos;s and explo@@ red a variety of mot@@ if@@ s , including a possible domestic deal . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice premi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice premi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , I will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restor@@ ing the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; in a particular stage , the criteria of the schedule of the schedule of the schedule of Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA timet@@ able has been updated in this respect , &quot; explained &apos; Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM comm@@ ented on the second part of the WA@@ DA to compliance with the code which describes the criteria for the re@@ integration of Rus@@ ada , and was recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , it does not contain anything that could cause for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list of these criteria represents that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities agree that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities agree with the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren too alle@@ ged state @-@ sponsored d@@ op@@ tics in Russian sports .
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we introduce the test , because our anti @-@ D@@ oping system has collap@@ sed .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we won &apos;t be ad@@ mit what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agree with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales outlet R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov put problems in the past in Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeat@@ edly said that the report of contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations .
no one has allowed to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
in November 2015 , Rus@@ ada was ruled by the D@@ oping @-@ Sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA to conduct d@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier N@@ ig@@ gli declared that Rus@@ ada moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di sold not a egg anymore .
they shared the business groups .

only eggs to Al@@ di can only be supplied to Al@@ di , which have proven to be tested negative at fi@@ de @-@ containing anti @-@ can@@ st products .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not be coming to the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett to compete with your employee &apos;s luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the survey@@ s did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - che@@ ating .
and even when an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers didn &apos;t trust in the process .
&quot; there was simply no consist@@ ency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed &apos;s 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company .
she has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licens@@ ing of software , which allows the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment to offer special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to handle the C @-@ Suite leadership and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the prosec@@ ution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up Gl@@ int , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees .
the rett said that she has a better gli@@ mp@@ se of what your employees think and feel in the three years with Gl@@ int .
in addition to the Snap @-@ Pol@@ ls and Pol@@ ls of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company that shows up a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low conditions results - so you can drill out why .
companies come to study that at the top of the workplace culture , so you have not been involved in the next U@@ ber , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee has published a blog @-@ mail , with those who have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start ups like Gl@@ int , this request is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business .
global Govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 118@@ ,@@ 7 billion , according to the financing @-@ technical site let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad conduct and to recogn@@ ise , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of this year am@@ id@@ st the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ c@@ re@@ dit .
converting has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
Premium has recently signed as a client .
like Gl@@ int , converting company can send custom @-@ tail@@ ored &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; to retri@@ eve conf@@ id@@ ential answers in real time and view the warmth cards of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that can report to bad behavior .
and when the chief advis@@ or is involved , complaints can go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of public opinion covers the reg@@ ul@@ ators &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found , that holds up his employees either bad@@ ly or is un@@ eth@@ ical , it may experience cost consequences by consumers &apos; boy@@ c@@ ott , worker c@@ ay@@ ment and law@@ suits , says Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , converting to more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the politics and method and have an easy way to reach their company headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to sign a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company centre , suggest@@ ion a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a bad experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to pursu@@ e the complaints of staff .
well , since the company conver@@ cent , problems that were hidden from exec@@ u@@ tives , have been hidden in offices in cities or states , such as dis@@ cri@@ mination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or un@@ fair pract@@ ition@@ ers .
&quot; I can closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with jobs , &quot; Vit@@ rano rides the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disp@@ utes . &quot;
in 2002 , companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employees of commitment to 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out for eth@@ ical viol@@ ations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; said they knew that you couldn &apos;t stop her dirty laundry .
&quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people employed hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Gl@@ int and Conver@@ cent offer your Software as a service , and loads the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors . both start @-@ ups are supported .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the entire capital to $ 47 million .
spar@@ kle secured a $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture partners and raised its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising in view of the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees expect more than so far .
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreci@@ ated , that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when human beings are happy to be in a company , and that the work you are doing , then feel free to do this company , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which was both Conver@@ ted and Gl@@ int .
investors att@@ ain yield when their portfolio companies go well . companies go well when employees are employed and engaged .
when the Analytics Tools third parties promise , commitment and commitment to staff , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data relating to the employees of the Work@@ station culture is important .
but data is us@@ eless if the Administrator does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , it may anticip@@ ate that change is on the way .
and if the change is not quick enough , or not at all , this can dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees motiv@@ ate .
&quot; when you ask about 4,000 questions , you must be willing to have 4,000 con@@ vers@@ ations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management company K@@ otter International , who has seen it to the collecting of data .
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow the staff , &quot; Are you really heard me ?
do you take care of that ?
and if you don &apos;t worry about it , why should I ? &quot;
Mad@@ ison Re@@ ed , who is now through monthly emplo@@ yers , was able to lead measures on the same day when a problem is reported over Gl@@ int as a result .
and after the Colle@@ c@@ ting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees she was able to real@@ ise several teams within the company and to add a communications training to address the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company always ob@@ tains new in@@ sights into staff , and ho@@ pes that for a long view , this leads to a better li@@ ft@@ ment of emplo@@ yers in a sector which is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you will lose customers too .
and if you lose customers , you will lose company .
N@@ CAA is elim@@ in@@ ating two days practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers under@@ go on one side of the teams in the campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ c@@ oto@@ x@@ ies and show the back at a swe@@ at of the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the team this one @-@ two minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled to the summer break , will return after the three @-@ hour prac@@ tise , before they return to the next morning at 6 : 30@@ am to the National Football Center .
&quot; this is the next three days a real tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday of Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and she actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three train@@ ings of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to just@@ ify the already packed times of the player .
the com@@ promise route from the two days is more than one day , passed by at the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time while Mor@@ as played practical exercises during the summer school .
they are expected to hold 18 exercises during the course of August 18 . before beginning of formal game preparations for their kick off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he supports the N@@ CAA division &apos;s change , even if they add the pre@@ occupied routes of the players a further point .
&quot; we lay these enormous strain on three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; and they simply ex@@ presses them , they move on , they are great people .
I think you come back to Saturday and we have more time it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp end is finished , which is covered by a clear view of its fields from a adjacent parking place and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of a high @-@ rise apartment , which was already stored in a gate behind a door b@@ ull , no easy task .
Bru@@ n players will occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there might be a problem if these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far to think that people rent there a room and then set it to record a practice .
if you have video ob@@ server from an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I &apos;m not wor@@ ried about too big wor@@ ries .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook w@@ ho@@ pes to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ fe@@ it messages
Facebook aims to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and their results under the original feature , said the world &apos;s largest online social network at Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods and send them to invo@@ ive that may display the results of the facsimile examination out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many of which believe they have also influenced the US pre@@ sidential election in 2016 .
the problem has become a major political topic in Europe , whereby the French vot@@ ers in the pre@@ sidential elections were over@@ floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan to be pun@@ ished by the social media networks such as before the elections in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a review of the new facts ver@@ ification .
&quot; besides the real@@ ization , which stories of fact authorized third parties are attracted to meeting what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she also added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; related articles &quot; and will be working on other changes to his messages to reduce false news .
creating a Comic @-@ novel : a castle in the history of England
in its younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ he was a lo@@ op@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has wit@@ ness@@ ed 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his hom@@ ely Shel@@ ter at the Ar@@ ent River Valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ iry Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of som@@ eb@@ ody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ary .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sailed the time from the Middle Ages up to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ w@@ icz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Palmer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other News &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was an emotional wise .
&quot; I have only responded to the th@@ umb pressure on the page of a letter , who was written by a double act in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his th@@ umb pressure !
and letters always sm@@ elled to smoke , as then there was a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the od@@ or has a effect as if he himself was .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old pap@@ er@@ ings it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England . &quot; to be honest , I really seems to be a little over@@ size &quot; ) this all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Victor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , making the archives and study the many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , like the mon@@ g @-@ heads of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tr@@ ench .
he mig@@ rated through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapes , gar@@ den@@ ing , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , he tran@@ scri@@ be &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access , when the last visited , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees just started to worry about the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years ago in which ar@@ ist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it to the attic . &quot;
Tag@@ eb@@ te , letters from the period of the English emp@@ ires , maps , which are saying , &quot; one could mean that land conflic@@ ts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection are using the castle as a starting point to inv@@ ade the wider basis of the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man to join the newly built castle in order to join the farmers of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there &apos;s a record from a ri@@ ot who occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ as@@ antry was in this field and I thought , a sur@@ rection was a good start .
maybe the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are conf@@ used in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patented , hidden the family of Dar@@ rell for seven years .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , presented in the 18th century sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , who filled his own fun@@ er@@ al by a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was formed only years later when his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; to be the gent@@ le@@ men of law@@ ful G@@ aun@@ er , making their deb@@ ts and make money for things they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men dissolved their debt crisis by having rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a tal@@ ent to advert@@ ise fatigue . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rho@@ des in search of other unique spec@@ im@@ ing experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about sp@@ ur@@ ishes from the early 20th century , which has been re @-@ called again by nature .
but Scot@@ ney got a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I must cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has started its campaign to launch a new roof brand ( Rundschau von Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to hold the logo and the s@@ logan .
at the end of August it will be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; asks M@@ acher &apos;s action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) don &apos;t really &quot; write it on their website .
&quot; but we util@@ ize this measure to win your attention .
and to make obvious that some is better than it seems .
in essence , we are sure to know that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
with this action , it &apos;s more than just &quot; a logo and a s@@ logan , it &apos;s more .
&quot; it is considered to form@@ ulate a single evaluation , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able unique setting . &quot;
eventually she stands in the competition with other municip@@ alities .
a mid @-@ digit amount can be given to the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f to cost their new roof brand and the campaign .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an an@@ xi@@ ety about the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) performed on pen@@ sion@@ ers and survey@@ s .
so this week also .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine at the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place in the General Staff Building , like the former , but in the office of the prime minister .
in the consult@@ ations under the pre@@ sidency of the Government , the Five Vice @-@ Pre@@ sid@@ ents also and the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
so they were civilians in the mean number .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
Walter us@@ i Ak@@ ar , Chief of staff , remains in office , but the com@@ mander of the host , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the coup d &quot; é@@ p ground Erd@@ og@@ an has fired moment@@ ary ch@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alle@@ ged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , in the Erd@@ og@@ an as a dragon head of the coup .
at 486 persons , which was supposed to have been involved directly at the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since that week .
already on the day after the coup Erd@@ og@@ an referred to the crash test as a &quot; Divine gift , &quot; he had the opportunity to give him the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an has really in touch with Erd@@ og@@ an ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article by the heading &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there is concerns of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army that manif@@ ested among others in raising the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , the paper wrote .
the large @-@ pur@@ ification of the army and the security forces continue to continue .
Erd@@ og@@ an sent another 73@@ 95 military service by decre@@ e in mid @-@ July , among them 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
however , Erd@@ og@@ an seemed to be t@@ amed of the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times , she car@@ ed her role as the role of wor@@ ld@@ ly state of the world .
after his election victory in 2002 Erd@@ og@@ an im@@ posed the power of the military group by step , not least regarding the re@@ form@@ ative of the European Union .
former officers say the Erd@@ og@@ an driver deli@@ ber@@ ately st@@ aging an Islam@@ ization of armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a particularly well @-@ known officer who seek@@ s to ask for the coup attempt by dist@@ ress and persec@@ ution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be filled with extreme extre@@ mist@@ s and sal@@ af@@ ists within a few years .
if this is true , the N@@ ato could not be cold .
anyway , there is no doubt in the Allianz after the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army .
management structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
it will give a new US migration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quot@@ ed by media .
he looks ahead of reducing the legal immig@@ rants to 50,000 per year , str@@ ing@@ ent regulations for the proce@@ eding of vis@@ as for a temporary working permit and limit@@ ations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , wages and billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will continue to change the way in the US as the citizens from other countries will be transfer@@ ed . &quot;
the law will prevent the fet@@ ters on migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak english for themselves and knowledge that will benefit from our economy , &quot; says Tr@@ ump , quot@@ ed by the American media .
Ministry wants to re@@ break the track for racing shuttle
over the past few months , the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les had been contro@@ versi@@ al - now it should go fast .
even before the end of the year the travel lane is scheduled to be built .
in order to secure the future of the road for the long @-@ term , according to information from the traffic Ministry is scheduled to begin work on the track this year .
&quot; with the decision to continue to order the circuit Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ bridge , and conf@@ esses the country to this especially for tourism , &quot; announced public prosec@@ utor Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the repair of the route paid to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country is 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country , shall pres@@ um@@ ably be voted , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the southern urban rail as a operator can be found at the technical details .
&quot; the timet@@ able that provides vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the Rail Service will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this should be the most easy @-@ to @-@ fly shuttle on December 2017 .
the racing shuttle is an especially popular rail connection between Il@@ men@@ au railway stations and a race course .
in the course of a pilot plant , in the course of a pilot plant has been tested whether the distance of many people will be used to order again in the future .
the track is also strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it can not be crazy as 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
Yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor for Robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take up their ascent seriously .
customers can select the lens of the robot , its shape of the nip@@ ples and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the company deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key said in the release of his new report .
modern Sex@@ y@@ dol@@ ls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm , with aware of human reactions which can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt its robot according to his belie@@ fs &quot; and select it all , from the eye @-@ paint of the robot about the shape of the nip@@ ples up to the type or color of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there will be al@@ ar@@ ming as many robots who would like &quot; person@@ alities &quot; would look like a Step@@ ford @-@ woman .
modern Sex@@ y@@ dol@@ ls have developed to robots using a silicone membrane .
the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example to custom@@ ize its users to adapt their robots to the properties , as for example , for example .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; F@@ rigid Far@@ rah &quot; giving the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; adv@@ ent@@ uro@@ us personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is as good as possible , &quot; is war@@ med the site of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc .
during the day she also has their m@@ oo@@ ds - just like real people !
she can be tired of being a conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many al@@ ar@@ ming aspects of this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the enter@@ taining female characteristics , with one step to F@@ rigid ( i.e. here : cont@@ ex@@ orable ) Far@@ rah is f@@ ading , and the most common one .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a Vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the website .
however , these sex robots don &apos;t only have a coffee table or just another sex@@ toys .
their origin and increasing refin@@ ement refer to something dark and de@@ eper in our culture , on a withdrawal from the Ideal to the sex@@ es towards a wish after sex with sub@@ mission as an optional allowance .
most of the males will of course stop sex robots , while the FR@@ R noticed their increasing popularity , however , they remain temporary at the edge of the consumer culture .
but what comes from the edge zones can be se@@ ep@@ ed in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very teach@@ able .
and many people are not we@@ ir@@ d or ins@@ ul@@ ting , until they are admitted to them the free market .
there is a certain su@@ bar@@ gain that this highly developed sex robots in a time occurr@@ ing in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which in the White House there is a president , who thus boo@@ sted women and being attacked by women .
the most awesome aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn out bodies and the well @-@ equipped eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment , this doesn &apos;t feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots there is to make physical simil@@ ar@@ ity to actual women as realistic as techn@@ ically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their pe@@ ac@@ ies want to feel human beings that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , at the point , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities &quot; the robots don &apos;t represent any real women .
you can not separate or simply go away from their companion .
they don &apos;t have a background or background history , nothing which could distur@@ b the imag@@ ination tot@@ al under@@ gain .
it is different : they are f@@ ake sl@@ aves .
or to express it in the reform agenda by 2017 : maid
m@@ umps high performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the by@@ word of the healthy human spirit
it has become a binary code of the ump @-@ era that the political split , which have polar@@ ized the US vot@@ ers , have divided families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ sting dank@@ o there were newspapers in the US newspapers , with advice about how to handle tears of Tr@@ ump .
we str@@ apping us all the supp@@ os@@ edly , to let our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of m@@ umps , families together .
I chose this because my co@@ us@@ in , a left @-@ directed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family to visit me this week in New York .
they remember@@ ed that the unity may have a strong enemy against a common enemy .
with a ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the re@@ publi@@ can relationship , with which she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite pec@@ uli@@ ar on the same side .
in order to the dining table this is certainly a good thing but it falls in another context that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his pre@@ sidency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ace@@ ful way that his cookies won &apos;t be to@@ g@@ gl@@ ed for one day .
however , there is still a long @-@ term long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of exter@@ mination .
today I find myself from an active nost@@ alg@@ ic version of the land@@ fall - the dog on the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how the tax returns ) - which occur in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump comes , the next candidate of rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be just spiritual , to qualify for im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my co@@ us@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the Car@@ us@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the Car@@ ous@@ el , New York Park@@ our , and the best three dollars that can be sold in the city if no caffeine is needed .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs at the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ y@@ red and the animals are turning to look at full fear about their own shoulders - very glo@@ om@@ y and clim@@ atic music give it a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a town dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old when Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of exc@@ it@@ ement , and the reality of the city is not justified .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day , when I found out that Swiss Cottage is , there is no Swiss cottage - the themes Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a great round@@ about in the north London .
central Park kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , since there are two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s that can go on it and all have a great time .
when I could s@@ have the car@@ ous@@ el , I could have given a full score , but fortunately nobody asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to ass@@ ess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in coffee bar on the corner of my road , it is the same as plus the option to pay by a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also put pressure on the server to bring personality in a situation , which is no necessary .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ it@@ ingly gr@@ ins@@ ing , while I tired the experience he had to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ or@@ ius with chest pain from prison into the hospital
Pist@@ or@@ ius has left the prison for the second time at a hospital visit .
last year he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of inc@@ ess@@ ings , he was tort@@ ured by a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ or@@ ius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder on an appeal in the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by going through a door of toilet cub@@ icle in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ or@@ ius claimed he claimed his girl@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ tly inv@@ aders which was hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their inten@@ tion to present the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ or@@ ius App@@ ell , which they say to be c@@ auti@@ ously .
the National Criminal Court said that she will be ob@@ jection with the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ or@@ ius is in danger that his penalty increases to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold is a pec@@ uli@@ ar egg
the last of the Blum@@ berger schools were gr@@ illed from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen for holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school , four at the secondary school .
school attend@@ ant Angel@@ ika Se@@ ats welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house of Bi@@ es@@ ental at E@@ up@@ en@@ hofen .

the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Adler in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold was a pec@@ uli@@ ar egg , and left it out of his h@@ ens .
instead of a chicken spot a little eag@@ le came out .
but the hope of making him a chicken , dist@@ or@@ ched , the eag@@ le spread its wings on a high mountain , and so@@ aked .
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank a chicken t@@ anz .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder che@@ ers to w@@ ager .
the eag@@ le stand for the integration , said gu@@ iding in Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
indeed , the young was different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but he belonged to the young .
he will never be like a chicken .
his dest@@ iny is to be free .
she needs every four @-@ gra@@ der that he feels in his new school .
it followed thanks to thank@@ s@@ word to the colleagues , the former director Michael Müller , who has always sk@@ inn@@ ed back with educational institutions , and the parents representatives .
the cu@@ c@@ umber is over now , the class@@ teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they only ent@@ ail their pupils after two years of classes , because it was a really great time .
finally , she can rely on the four @-@ fold .
at the end all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .
this was great joy with the children .
eight first devices are already registered for the new school year .

Software Update for Diesel Cars : what those who need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in the survey .
at the diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission of emission standards Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are ex@@ empt@@ ed .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe there are estimates :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates will only apply to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the retro@@ fitting has arranged the KRA@@ FT@@ F@@ LIGHT @-@ Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers informed about updates ?
the makers have announced an immediate implementation in the next few months , but not yet exact dates .
Daimler has shared , to at@@ tribute each person concerned .
if you have an inspection , it will be done in its framework .
how long should the retro@@ fit lie down ?
&quot; difficult to say &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the app@@ endi@@ ces from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen volun@@ tar@@ ily acting the autom@@ aker on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop .
the time el@@ abor@@ ate could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will be waiting for .
pres@@ um@@ ably foreign manufacturers would move , thus s@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is a massive price reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE will not be afraid .
but in the regions where co@@ ws are dro@@ pping .
there is no im@@ pair@@ ings for older diesel until now .
the ACE tra@@ ys , with a sale still waiting .

we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ k@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to pension next year .
the site is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are r@@ ar .
for 31 years , keeper of the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press meetings .
it talks of varied , but challenging tasks that wait for its successor .
at the same time , I ad@@ m@@ ire him to ful@@ fil the requirement profile .
the city is looking for the nearest possible time a architects or engineer engineer .
thus - by respec@@ ting the regular cancellation conditions - still plenty of time for a dra@@ f@@ ting .
since Has@@ lach was acting for the administration community as an enterprise authority , the applic@@ ants must propos@@ e appropriate financial statements .
because this function wants to keep the city straight .
if no longer wish to re@@ plen@@ ish them , people would have to navigate up to Off@@ enburg .
but citi@@ zen@@ ship be of the city and himself , says W@@ acker that reports from a good operating climate and a good mood between authority and citizens .
some important projects have accum@@ ulated in office for more than 30 years , looking back with pride .
&quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; he is safe about the building and staff .
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Dutch car park is around .
the Kin@@ z@@ ig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still a theme .
the latter alone will suff@@ ice with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design days be available for a city building with great play room .
Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own own building yard and gar@@ den@@ ers can be flexib@@ ly respon@@ sive to many .
&quot; one can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the fo@@ unders are often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
since the old town is as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have a eye on which it fits , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ izes the differenti@@ ating city building master .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister con@@ tributes high responsibility .
he is builder , &quot; at the end everything runs through my table . &quot;
in case of support and coordination , it can count on long @-@ term staff : Markus Neum@@ a@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with Manfred Schön@@ er ( Low@@ est ) for 15 years .
also , his successor is long , W@@ acker is des@@ iring : &quot; we look for someone who wants to look really and remain . &quot;
because of continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the other design of the city .
who wants to qu@@ it Roland W@@ acker should have completed his studies as a Gradu@@ ate Engineer and Bachelor of Technical University as a Gradu@@ ate Engineer and compl@@ eting good knowledge in the fields of building and construction planning .
the city council offers high@@ - and low @-@ construction , construction planning , tom@@ under@@ growth opportunities , municipal property management with building yard and municipal authority , including monument protection .
cycling on pipes : southern track im@@ prisoned
according to police , those previously unknown cul@@ ts had the blue bike from the railway gli@@ ding in the area of the Le@@ o@@ bener Road ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
they were so bad@@ ly damaged that the ring@@ ing goods had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ator come from two male val@@ leys and are looking for the night hours after them .
near the crime , witnesses were a ros@@ ary rolling and a bicycle driver had been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a li@@ mp@@ tion , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A .
the or the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors could have brought itself in great danger and also end@@ ang@@ ered the train traffic .
next to the engine of the engine and the complex , as well as the delay and costs for rail revenues , other railway customers could also be added to the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors .
overall , the spokes@@ man said from a &quot; significant &quot; sum .
the damage were re@@ fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south route was carried out without dis@@ abilities .
barely ten personnel ho@@ ists about Friday morning were unusual , two of which are talking about correspondence .
freight lifts were not falling from , but they were bel@@ ated .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be ex@@ changed around 200 metres .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients may relie@@ ve patients with inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel diseases .
the un@@ healed state , affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom , affects stomach cr@@ amps and blo@@ uses , recur@@ ring or blood circulation , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those concerned , meat and dairy products are usually gu@@ iding to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found the amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an of proteins , who promote immune cells , who promote a toler@@ ant Dar@@ m .
the Executive resear@@ cher , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the intest@@ inal pat@@ rol , to ensure that the harmful micro@@ bes hidden in the food , not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are unable to resol@@ ve inflamm@@ ations , protect the tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissue .
when the balance is too far south towards inflamm@@ ation , it can result in an inflamm@@ atory bo@@ wel .
in experiments we found that a type of tolerance convey@@ ing immune cells occurs in mice , which bear a particular bacter@@ ium in their feed .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the values of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus cere@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal portion of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ds and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an the mice were in their food , the more they had by these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an out@@ tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed bo@@ wel mil@@ ie@@ us promotes if the same system is conf@@ using at humans .
the Post@@ doc@@ toral resear@@ cher Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an encour@@ aged a kind of immune cell who found tolerance when it was found that a group of study bats had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe that had been separated .
it thought that the difference was to do with the Dar@@ mm@@ ik@@ ro@@ bi@@ omen of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
the fer@@ mentation of mice were found in DNA and were found six bacterial species , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but lack@@ ing them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that a Dar@@ mm@@ ik@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome was lack@@ ing and they did not develop the type of immune cells , and they did they did the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria over@@ took the immune system , the researchers observed L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid , and out@@ lined small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ate cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved itself as a side product of the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an met@@ abol@@ ism , known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent , but when tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ ise were cut , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that men have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us defend L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known if tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an @-@ out@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in mice such as mice , but defects in gen@@ es have been found in relation to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an .
she said , &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells shall alter inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potenti@@ ally , high tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ values can be found in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to a expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believed that Manchester United engaged a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic
with Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic , a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; signed , believes Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pound signature from Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game , before the UEFA Cup match against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressive in the holder roll , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Pereira will be prepared .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the Pre @-@ Asia tour of the blues and he managed only 45 minutes to lead to Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve the Premier League season before beginning of the Premier League .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thin@@ ks , he thin@@ ks , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him be ready earlier than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic start@@ up Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u at the Avi@@ va Stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho became its start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; The Independent revealed this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho could still wish to ful@@ fill three further agreements , but it was already having a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to ful@@ fil three of its four priority re@@ bu@@ tions .
&quot; three of them , I thank the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier when you got four out of four , but they gave herself great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the US air@@ plane Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off from Seattle on the U.S. state of Washington , but in the Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and with@@ drew in the form of a dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screen the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such a advertising .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD @-@ b@@ oss , op@@ ted social democratic pre@@ sid@@ ents always at a certain sor@@ row to Berlin .
just no stor@@ fi@@ res from the party set , only a head@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important wish of the const@@ ants .
since Martin Schulz the party has pro@@ found@@ ly pro@@ found@@ ly al@@ tered .
since then the employee is watching the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ house with increasing the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ned state cap@@ itals .
what Schulz had been from there since the beginning of the year , is not described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were dr@@ unk .
and one after another .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal Republic of Lower Saxony has a general signal against the SPD and the Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony .
&quot; this one shows once again : red @-@ Green cannot be re@@ stra@@ ined , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editor network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surpris@@ ingly frac@@ tion@@ ist of a Gre@@ ens M@@ EP@@ s has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months prior to the Kur@@ dish station , his red @-@ green co@@ alition has thus lost their one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens German busin@@ ess@@ man Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the wicked @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ west to rep@@ ay her mand@@ ate .
the transfer to CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the vot@@ ers .
El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return to her mand@@ ate , &quot; said the German busin@@ ess@@ man and campaign organisation of Gre@@ ens Germany &apos;s German ed@@ itorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; that must not be true all , &quot; she sig@@ hed a SPD suff@@ rage than Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ ch reached the party centres .
Stephan We@@ il , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the re@@ sign@@ ation of the green pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ xt into the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the provis@@ ional highlight of a full range of large and small cr@@ ises in the SPD @-@ country .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the mission began with the un@@ exp@@ ecting defeat during the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the com@@ ra@@ des at the time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then too - and everything was worse .
in Kiel , the SPD in Kiel produced the Tau@@ el , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite sculpt@@ ed the party smooth .
the com@@ ra@@ des appeared again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had made new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land ste@@ amer , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his city .
and because it is so pretty wrong in the crisis communication , what to make wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival .
now even Stephan We@@ il .
due to the VW @-@ emission and its role in the super@@ visory board , the Dutch Prime Minister stood in the criticism for longer in criticism .
mi@@ ese um@@ ption values were added .
still , or perhaps straight , We@@ il tried to get stronger in the covenant of acc@@ ents in the last weeks .
the top of the former may@@ or of Hanover , expanding its power in Berlin , did not hide from Martin Schulz as well .
they left him , as they promised by We@@ il a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in the case We@@ il meets the party con@@ fin@@ er , the low@@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens basically gets no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz did not work at all .
the com@@ ra@@ des therefore en@@ de@@ av@@ our to hold their own ranks .
her wrath is aimed at the Green , and here especially to the revol@@ ting par@@ liament@@ ar@@ ment in the West .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and corporate reve@@ aling how Mrs. T@@ v@@ ail provides her own kar@@ ri@@ er@@ ase about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party in the SPD @-@ Bundestag , the editor network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ life@@ jacket has not been elected for its person as a direct rule , but on the State list of the Green@@ ery Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Lower Saxony @-@ member states further .
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mand@@ ate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD parliamentary group , &quot; Indi@@ cted a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
four years ago , &quot; vot@@ ers were clear : &quot; men made Stephan We@@ il to minister @-@ pre@@ sid@@ ents , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as a leading candidate in the Bundestag .
&quot; now , the personal Car@@ ri@@ er@@ ed@@ ness of a future CD@@ U members dis@@ missed the election results , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said .
he called to el@@ abor@@ ate the background .
I want to know if more has been more or an ongoing addition of the CD@@ U Niedersachsen has been given .
funding of local distribut@@ ors III
those who want to restore the house in the years , will soon get support from the country .
this inform@@ al may@@ or Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ST@@ EG City Development began on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a look back to the events so far .
since 1991 it has been rest@@ ing in Emp@@ fingen .
back then , in the reconstruction area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg have yet acquired two thir@@ ds of the funding amount .
in the re@@ habilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the hi@@ ther@@ to renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to encour@@ age the internal development and not just new building areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Government of the Karlsruhe , that there will be a renovation area III .
the amount amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros are from the country , the remain@@ der of the municipality of Emp@@ fingen .
how is a sanit@@ ising area now ar@@ ises ?
you will continue to investig@@ ate Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; houses are really old &quot; houses .
but it does also play a role either in the planned area of all interest existing .
if applicable , the prayer festival could then shift again .
the ST@@ EC represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the contents of the Federation @-@ countries &quot; Social City , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be performed .
the core of the program is the vit@@ alisation of in@@ con@@ structions , improving the living and working conditions and main@@ taining the infrastructure .
the measures would be referred to object , which means per plot .
the renovation area would then finally be determined as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding period has been running until April 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 2026 .
until September this year , however , only once the inventory was carried out , in the framework of those involved in the reconstruction surface involved a quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire .
in November or December , if possible the pro@@ positi@@ onal order is to be performed , thus can begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then stated that each Commun@@ e did carry out the def@@ end@@ ant investig@@ ations .
it is about to ass@@ ess the urban alle@@ g@@ ences and decide how to determine when and in which scope .
it will then be registered for a plot of land in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to Emp@@ fingen and got a picture of the situation , she spoke .
Got@@ tz@@ el emphas@@ ized , an essential strategic factor for the project was the participation of the involved .
this is why it will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks post@@ oper@@ atively and to be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow frag@@ aire is the &quot; building and building , &quot; where it is among other things that goes among the structural condition and re@@ structuring purposes .
the grey quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing situation , &quot; can be set up to size , gradu@@ ation and residents of a living room .
the blue &quot; Working arc &quot; is only to be completed when building commercial premises .
however , however , Go@@ zel pointed out to that a full @-@ filled quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire is not at the same time a request for funding .
new buildings will also be non @-@ eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of convey@@ ing means by the &quot; Wind@@ gre@@ y@@ principle &quot; functional - who first comes first , war@@ ns first .
you cannot reserve any conveyor belts for later &quot; . &quot;
on the end of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ iers II &quot; was shown to make a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door to his office , and even starting with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the win@@ dy chip between th@@ um@@ bs and Ze@@ i@@ ass@@ inger and now offers the service for enterprises and individuals offering their life with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has worked together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ory capacity to aes@@ thes@@ ists in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , Han@@ ts . to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is done according to medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr North@@ am also wants to change the pal@@ aces to houses and cars that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now fitted both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology , which begins if his hand is at the helm .
the advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers .
the residence of the White House , a navy helicopter to fly to South La@@ wn for an event , which costs American manufacturing in the last month , cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military magazine , which have been transferred to the TIME Magazine by up to 24@@ .000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President on board was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American style programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief offici@@ als of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicopter shown in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was shown in addition to a yacht charter from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a For@@ k@@ lift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
after the helicopter of the White House , the presence of the helicopter demanded in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before helicopter to the South La@@ wn , after the recordings of the helicopter flight Hel@@ icopter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of it , because it is an unusual event with high vis@@ ibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to meet his pre@@ set , the dep@@ uty nav@@ al man@@ de@@ ur of aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn for about 15 o &apos;clock in the morning to the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and until the la@@ wn was ev@@ acu@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds to the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team for return flight would be needed .
during the event , the original flight crew was during the event , while the security personnel remained on the ground during the time .
the recordings provided by the TIME are not clearly stated , whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its public property to use nation@@ ally property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event might injury .
&quot; one question that we set out whether it was a viol@@ ation of the Hatch Ac@@ ts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander .
&quot; sounds , as if you are shut up , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was called by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by Brands Act .
but even official events have political colon@@ el .
at this event , President gave a c@@ lash for reform of health reform that was in the Senate , and he pro@@ pag@@ ated the efforts to re@@ strain the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from polit@@ ically advant@@ age@@ ous purposes .
President are oblig@@ ed to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation in February through the pre@@ sidential aircraft in front of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of president aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the Show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ying often lead training flights in the region around Washington and South La@@ wn by using U.S. president in the White House with a precise cen@@ timet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was in Germany in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise experiences in the White House .
the flight to the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said an official .
hel@@ icop@@ ters units also flo@@ wn 11 hours to this day for &quot; Non @-@ Pre@@ sidential Supp@@ orts . &quot;
the White House said that the pay@@ ers won &apos;t pay the load for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to dis@@ miss the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 provides no bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for the Pre@@ sidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the annual assess@@ ing of the Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D revenue for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
recordings of unity indicate the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from home base of the marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual resources . &quot;
according to a RAN@@ D study from 2015 , the refund of Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er def@@ ended , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that will be made in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is fair , of course , to highlight it . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ act with the helicopter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of fire@@ man cars .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to the representative of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and jo@@ int@@ ly with the media on its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before a s@@ iff@@ er task
leading leader of the Second tennis Bundesliga comes to the table advanced Search s@@ dor@@ fer SV .
TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss premier@@ ed tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the table from Such@@ s@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite five games still a mac@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the leader in the Second tennis League has won the sense of reality .
Team@@ manager Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has any respect for your opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in a similar formation .
straight on the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability of the SV @-@ dor@@ fer , the imports are from the north .
&quot; the Danish and Fin@@ ns can even refer to the Davis Cup .
and they are strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view on Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Peder@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ erre@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this will always be difficult for us .
you also need good luck . &quot;
the t@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high North is convenient .
his debut in blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
currently it does not play during the Ch@@ allen@@ ger Tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man not to the Bundesliga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar &apos;s Czech Republic ( Czech Republic ) is one of his first use during this season .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump not worked when he sat his signature by the law to dis@@ appearance the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his h@@ ast to release the law , &quot; the Congress held a few &quot; un@@ const@@ itutional regulations . &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels continues to be ash@@ amed of the US .
at least , the draft analysis , European companies propos@@ es to help the Rus@@ sians , to build gas pip@@ el@@ ines to the EU .
since then , investors of the O@@ MV is con@@ fin@@ alized together with other European firms such as the construction of Russian East Timor North Stream 2 .
the dr@@ y@@ ls is trem@@ end@@ ous .
nevertheless , it would be too early for a estim@@ ation of consequences , so the official statement of oil cont@@ enti@@ s .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump never has to aw@@ ake the sanctions for life by an executive order .
twelve weapons are at his own choice .
&quot; the press has watched which the Group could defend itself and which could really we@@ w him .
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cartel is set up in the heat series of Net@@ fli@@ x .
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer is unve@@ iled , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is still not long ahead .
the eas@@ els three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and shows the latest kids of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kartell .
results from four powerful p@@ ates , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 company , &quot; only with no state affairs and viol@@ ent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodrig@@ u@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the card@@ inal , Miguel Rodrig@@ u@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is the Mexican link , and Che@@ pe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
with the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal comes back to Javier Pe@@ ña , the guy , the American and Colom@@ bian pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary authorities to encour@@ age the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .

roll back@@ wards : the city sets 46 kitchen@@ ware
the city organ@@ izes the K@@ ita lunch again .
with firm response to the children and a m@@ apping to the team .
in the urban children care centres , the clock is turned back .
for the 1st September the city of Krefeld takes over the health care in the urban children &apos;s educational institutions ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director is a good news for Sonja , this is good news : &quot; we are all satisfied . &quot;
further to the house : a c@@ ater@@ er takes over this task and keeps fresh bo@@ iled cooled .
the city runs in the district of 46 children &apos;s shops , in 44 the children served at lun@@ ch@@ time a warm meal .
in the last kit@@ ten years , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing ste@@ adily .
&quot; meanwhile , eating only children that are car@@ ed for 45 hours per week in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains the Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; the offer is also available in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 . &quot;
46 gradu@@ ation from 1st September kitchen service : you should warm up the right food , comp@@ lement each salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , clean up the meal , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are al@@ located to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two ru@@ pp@@ ies as well as seven @-@ seven facilities - decides on the lesson of hours .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now living to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier to implement social concepts for the ital@@ y line . &quot;
for this is why it concerns : healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the curtains to the team is sen@@ sible .
even for the children .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a trade union is aimed at managers des Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on long @-@ term oblig@@ ation to make production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has shed the future of investments at the Toll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work , which is created next to other products Hob@@ bs and Rich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
in recent years Mc@@ V@@ ities said Pl@@ adis , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in the last years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; would learn how to learn how they would change their activities .
in a letter to the company &apos;s executive at the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on , &quot; concerns the financing of production lines will not be powered . &quot;
G@@ MB -@@ Senior @-@ organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win from the General @-@ Site Manager for the future of Toll@@ cross sub@@ missions to our members .
the generations of families have been working here and the labour forces concentrate on the local community and the greater space of Glasgow , an important pillar for human dign@@ ity in a field of high unemployment and social commitment .
therefore , at the point of view , the wage and pro@@ sper@@ ity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , rising demand of life and the chronic manufacturing decreased , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently has a th@@ ri@@ ving production cell at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meetings with the employees and G@@ MB representatives at Rab@@ cross , where some questions were discussed open@@ ly .
we discussed with the staff we are working as all companies who are working in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate who are constantly checked - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
it added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operative improvements .
we recogn@@ ise the heritage of Toll@@ cross as a production site fully and quite on . should our business operations end at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn . &quot;
did the real Madrid Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago ?
the page of La Liga wants to re@@ gre@@ t their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
in its persec@@ ution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , Paris Saint @-@ Germain suggested that it has an offer of £ 189 million , to resol@@ ve its release cl@@ ause , but did they war@@ ned Barcelona over three years ago ?
the sens@@ ational approach will be heated in the summer time , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after the completion of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , the world &apos;s most expensive player in the world and the most @-@ paid professional athl@@ ete in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar forced his way to the outside , although a source in the proximity of Catal@@ ans has always been given to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but was the football world recently war@@ ned of the real estate world three years ago ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ a@@ fi was a str@@ ing@@ ent warning for any club who wanted to sign the best player of real PSG .
&quot; I &apos;m not wor@@ ried , for they know that if they touch one of our player , we will contact to them in opposition to them , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ a@@ ifi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players , then this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona appears to have passed the line , with the Spanish association we express interest in the real @-@ field @-@ field team Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
it was clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest , by losing one of its price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Domain Report published by Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
Pope John R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s son @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has been relie@@ ved the case of the rain@@ bow case .
the complex@@ ion and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse of the S@@ ick@@ ens Cathedral continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ mann , spokes@@ man of the Re@@ formers , &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained to the publication from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger bishop of the former Regen@@ sberg , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ ald Pope Benedict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the oc@@ cl@@ usion of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger acquired their deep thre@@ ats about their own sub@@ missions , or at the back the wrong assessment of the processes .
the Council &apos;s newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , however , is critical that in the coverage of violence against &quot; two measure &quot; measured .
in terms of the handles in Regensburg , nobody said that it would have to be prevent@@ ed by &quot; in@@ spir@@ ing and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions &quot; handle , which pun@@ ished and in the future , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manip@@ ulation , &quot; is the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histor@@ ian and member of the National Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the An@@ char@@ ity , the Catholic Church as a source of all nau@@ gh@@ ty , is already part of everyday life experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ l@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis meant well in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you are happy to let the Church and this is a crazy fres@@ sen . &quot;
in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; imp@@ acts a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; has been &quot; to deal with nau@@ gh@@ ty kids , as I was one , ready to become . &quot;
it causes some un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with reports of mis@@ use , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
in 12 languages , author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , the author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , translated with &quot; My Br@@ other of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that was submitted by the bishop of Regensburg with the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
between 1945 and the early 1990s , a total of 547 million victims were created with high pl@@ au@@ sibility of &quot; victims of inter@@ ven@@ tions , 67 pre@@ aches of sexual assault .
in the final report it is to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; so sum@@ marily that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological strength were applied .
at high Emot@@ ional Ass@@ ess@@ ment the pun@@ ishment for students could even drop heavy .
however , unlike many other acc@@ lic@@ ations , many of the victims received the general humanity by retired and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories will be linked with him . &quot;
in an interview , H@@ es@@ emann also explains why the final report on the Sc@@ andal caused by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s descend@@ ants of his opinion .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 pages report about the &quot; occurr@@ ence of violence in case of viol@@ ation of the &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
one of these pupils dis@@ pen@@ se his &quot; humanity . &quot;
to the other , he also appears as chol@@ ester@@ ol and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was handled by the public , when a cathedral is mus@@ ically no top performance .
how do you look as his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when you read the effort and reads the entire 440 pages long from the front to the back , one must inform yourself why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all .
he is just 8 sides dedicated to him and he is clearly directed by any sus@@ pic@@ ion of Mitt@@ ens or cooperation in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the violence of violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of his active sphere .
it can be used too late if experi@@ encing or first hin@@ ts not taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ as@@ ium , in which he worked , was received by practically all the respon@@ d@@ ents - &quot; rede@@ mp@@ tion &quot; , &quot; sky &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
as well as the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents it as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expert , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ent &quot; and &quot; under@@ stand@@ able teacher , who supplied the guys regularly with cakes , cookies and swe@@ ets , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes from kids . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ained about his PER@@ F@@ EC@@ TIO@@ NI@@ SM and his high Emot@@ ional , who also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ses .
that he did not only thre@@ w with the chairs and cast it on the ground , but also Ear@@ rings and all@@ ot@@ ted boys on the hair or ears , he has promised herself to pro@@ claim and exc@@ use itself .
however , to his honour must be said that such education methods in the frag@@ ile time , in the 1960s and 197@@ 0s , were in parents such as teachers .
do you still know such as breeding methods ?
naturally , I think each of us was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a gymn@@ as@@ ium school .
compared to what is actually written in this report , namely the adv@@ ent@@ able sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the primary school , they are dre@@ ad@@ ful Bag@@ at@@ elles .
when you &apos;re asking on@@ es@@ elf if it is not more to do with his dis@@ ability and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI , that many media fell on him .
the b@@ av@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him , still ze@@ alo@@ us@@ ly .
but the truth is : the report written by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report was reported a lot on the subject of abuse during the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also gained some invol@@ vement in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aul@@ ts claims to have ent@@ ru@@ sted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were con@@ secr@@ ated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or mother , &quot; said a man concerned about the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing . &quot;
the real problem with the ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse has been and is , that most victims are silent .
if they tru@@ sted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a chorus master who would have been a colle@@ ague who would have been a che@@ er .
how do the scrat@@ ching student at R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in case of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ ed disc@@ ip@@ le did so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he had previously decided ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to maintain their per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors .
I consider it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , assume that it is calculated as well ... Bub@@ bles in@@ tr@@ usive or more also to have opened , than with their parents , inter@@ act instru@@ ctors , conf@@ identi@@ ality etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - and vul@@ ner@@ able . &quot;
thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; aff@@ ecting him in the field of concerned , and / or their environment , could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
so what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free of every cooperation .
thus , it cannot be rejected , nor may he be prevent@@ ed , or brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring its good name with this contro@@ versi@@ al crime as it was in some cases .
in the media a lot of &quot; non @-@ violence should be read at the &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the previous Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is described in the &quot; way@@ ward report . &quot;
does he have to live with this re@@ pro@@ ach ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem in the coverage it was mixed and mixed to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , somewhere in the middle of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
namely , there will be clean : between the pre@@ school and the gymn@@ as@@ ium of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we say , other pre@@ di@@ ces .
in addition , the inc@@ idents have been occurr@@ ing since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger won &apos;t have choir director of the cathedral .
all the aw@@ ful spec@@ im@@ etry , the cases where the boys of sa@@ dist@@ an teachers were shel@@ tered and dre@@ aming , at the primary school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sk@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to have dom@@ inion .
but with those dom@@ ination of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger won &apos;t do anything , for he only got the boys in his face when they were already at the farmer &apos;s Hy@@ mn .
that was , like most of the witnesses , the theme of &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; at t@@ abo@@ o .
you were just happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heav@@ enly places .
what was different at the ymn@@ as@@ ium Dom@@ ot@@ eng@@ ymn@@ as@@ ium ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was no discipl@@ ine , but no seas@@ onal violence prev@@ ailed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not at the moment , at most , the ve@@ il stays sk@@ imm@@ ed away .
but despite all efforts , the report was only servic@@ ed by two periods in which he was reported by the states of the primary school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself , and started by the previous generations of a school , which he didn &apos;t work and was responsible for it , and then again in 1993 .
did George R@@ atz@@ inger graduated in front of the states of consistent the ears ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ as@@ ium who was even re@@ produced in the report .
in this way , he points to prove that the test is still pract@@ ised in the primary school . &quot;
in view of the risk of negative press releases he was urg@@ ent .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity , as an investig@@ ator were banned in Bavaria .
before joining them in a legal grey zone , like everyone else I know .
it was difficult for him to take care of the people who were perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where the ad@@ missible border had been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say that he would always look away .
that &apos;s just not right .
in 1980 , the tests were officially abol@@ ished at schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it is un@@ fair to present the present day standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; fall of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger that took home to a moral measure .
the princ@@ ess has already right .
but this is , of course , not for sexual abuse , which was des@@ ir@@ able at all time , and also not for what is broken into the pre@@ school and violence in innocent children &apos;s sh@@ rim@@ ps , which goes beyond the same time .
all this is quite dre@@ ad@@ ful and I am glad that it &apos;s finally dealt .
but at the same time I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ine and pun@@ ishment , then earrings and ears , they were widely distributed in the 197@@ 0s .
when physical pun@@ ishment was banned then he has also been strictly forbidden .
which image of his rain@@ y@@ burger , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took us back in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Br@@ other of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject of Prü@@ fer to be spoken also by language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI said from his perspective , playing the cathedral does not play a minor part .
nevertheless , I believe that he conducted a strict reg@@ iment there .
but also that has to be said once : without these PER@@ F@@ EC@@ TIO@@ NI@@ SM , without any un@@ con@@ ditional discipl@@ ine , it would probably hardly be possible , from which until then a nation@@ ally known umbrella in Europe and his musical tradition that went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make a big singer and before every success , right in which area , yet still discipl@@ ine , passion and self @-@ win@@ dings .
what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on their book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through work on the book and in addition I &apos;ve met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always met again as wonderful , hum@@ orous and heart@@ y people , of which you can not imagine that he could not only do a fly .
I &apos;m still trying to get in touch with him as many former dom@@ ination , today , 23 years after his reti@@ rement , regularly in contact him - he is almost blind - and he &apos;s almost blind - and they treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not for@@ given him until today he was strictly speaking to them , thus clearly in the minority .
most of the domain are gr@@ ateful to him today , that he enrich@@ ed their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always a good , v@@ ater@@ nal teacher - a hard father that may be - but still a lov@@ able respect to which they are still looking for and the right to ad@@ mi@@ red them .
and please , once again clearly said : all what you propos@@ es to him are education methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be happy that we have long @-@ overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ fair , one man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make media sin@@ eb@@ uck .
there is the evil purpose which stands behind it , just too obvious .
for the report that was just published , was relie@@ ved him .
now it would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who poss@@ essed a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who would probably know great mer@@ its without leaving outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably nobody would have to let peace in peace .
