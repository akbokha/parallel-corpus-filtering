<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your look to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">One Irish Anstalt, where people are going to meet young people.</seg>
<seg id="3">A salary chapel, where the tunnel will now be dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivates the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of the coin encourages exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when landing cards are not currently present.</seg>
<seg id="7">It knows everybody who had to meet again because the auto-Navi took place a green meadow instead.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the Bayern Atlases, an offer by the Geoport as Bayern of the State Government, are all other than currently - but very technically informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, as cities and municipalities in the Munich Stock Exchange has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a Flickentejo that is not recognisable as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The large supervisation card were developed for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps, so called Uronsdatasheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were formed as the result of the Bavarian extension between 1810 and 1864 and early as the first distribution of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principle: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800 the French army leader had occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Napoleon I wish to an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns, of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops dismantled with the peace of Lunéville, from 9 February 1801, it was the same-day neighbours that created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Elector Max. Joseph went forward to the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Verification Amplifier.</seg>
<seg id="19">The original position for Munich is from the year 1856 and is available as any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">Early as early as early as the country's capitol is the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in 1856 in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map, which was part of the Munich district in 1877.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today it is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses were built in 1856 in 1856 of today's Plinganserstraße, which was named 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the opening of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: there is a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten flags, from the so-called "Urphoto," which was derived from the property tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots have no more farmers there today - but small gardeners of the facility "Land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is situated north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, founded in 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Uronsonsblatt read in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen just the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the height "On the fan" - but also in great letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield road you will once unlock people with travellers.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt managed by the Auer fans. "</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudrun the mentor - those Psychiatrist, who was transferred to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended for example the attachettes of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has taught the staff to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has been working for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">A first place for 280 patients was extended to 500 places later.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime this capacity reached no more - the reason for the construction of the cycle complex in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatry since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of former Auer Anstalt now adolescents in the Munich of Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and turned him into a youth-house with vocational training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the soccer field of the TSV Munich East, east of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" built in an architectural approach to the origin of the Irrenanstalt which was bombed during WWII during WWII.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was marked by 1856 as "main square." Kaufinger Gasse was called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of the minds.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 had many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a pinnacle from the Middle Ages, once began to work on the Marienhof, where these days will work and take place on 5 April 2017 of the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-card can be liveled with the air picture from today - and the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group released travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for promoting dyes has issued a warning for colored people who travel through discriminating politics and racist attacks on the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory authority for the federal state of Missouri, which until August 28, 2017 will be obliged to bring great attention to the Federal State of Missouri, a number of fragrant, racism-based intentions in recent times, occurring in the entire state and say," it's in the statement of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent adopted law of Missouri, which deliberately makes people harder to win discrimination bodies, as well as the prosecution of State, the Group to publish the group, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"you have injuries the civil rights, people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are challenged because of their skin's colours, they are put together or killed, "said President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such a warning that has exhibited the organization for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited as racist actions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in the early days in the beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also demonstrated on a recent report by the Office of the Office of Missouri, in which black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of their families, friends and collaborators, what could happen to Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be ready to bring credit money, or let the relatives let us know that they are travelling by the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 Hassins in 2015, after the latest numbers from the FBI's enemy's coverage of FBI, who entered the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place in the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The grounding is also an answer to a new Missouri-Law which was more difficult to complain a company because of residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued outwarnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted unmigratory authorities, to conceive people because of immigration violations, what is to contribute to the ACLU on further streamlining profiles.</seg>
<seg id="66">Commences are generally issued by foreign affairs for other countries, but in recent years, stakeholders "groups have to be in response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagre-handed Peter White and Cordula Kovac have a picture in front of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the celebration of the family of Schwendemann, the representative of the fisherman CDU-village met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann transferred insights into its premises in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest-farms, 40 dairy kisses and as well as many young kittens and houses in five flats.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest" is the alternative marketing way for the milk of its cows, so swivelling.</seg>
<seg id="73">Excluding the table of the guests, local visitors arrive exclusively.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also the BLHV Presidency of Fisbach, he called the Weidezaunching project as "elementary". "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not establish on derart parts.</seg>
<seg id="76">The greens area concerns a lot of work, much nuts are processed using the sense sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and tography," stressed Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he acquired free operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he makes no biobusiness.</seg>
<seg id="79">Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the commune has recognized the meaning of the course of course and is very happy with the leader funding."</seg>
<seg id="80">At cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare you need to be supported by farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reafforestation of the areas could go out yet a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and thought about how to continue their operation," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in the criticism of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open area is therefore 40 hectares, which are not enrolled out until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of €71 500, half of the leader was funded, a quarter contributed to the town of Fishing.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus we connecting the farmers 12 610 Euro, who they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weidezaun.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained swivelling.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac praised: "you do a really good job, without land farmers and land."</seg>
<seg id="90">For Peter White, also: "best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape of the Landscape Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state subsidy of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR-funded subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the inefficient area must not be inefficient (hangover 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the reafforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently under construction for the Fishernia project in 2018, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open area covers 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest mark of a regime change is enough to start attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as any other - therefore the cautiously staged Saddam Hussein's place on the Firm place in Baghdad in the year 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic act in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the proposals of the President on a drastic restriction of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A hordes of crucians and Liberty imitators would have been lynched when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed its importance, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the memorial, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta shimped: "I don't want to enter into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American Freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to refer later and not part of the original statue of Liberty is. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is really proper, but as he himself is formulated, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" your trouble, "your arms, your arms, and your worshy masses, which means to breathe freely to breathe freely.</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elende waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller received no criticism in literary criticism - he clearly knew that these people are not welcome at Trump States.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict for the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who prefer to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they were a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and Americanic republican show that in a sewn classical image depicting the female embodied of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the board with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change their right wing this way.</seg>
<seg id="118">The Great Schreihals Rush Limconstrucgh, a kind of John the Baptist for the Coming of Trump, argument in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was monopolitative, but rather an early neoconservative that moves to the American flame: "Lady Liberty is proceeding ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should wear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not light the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limconstrucgh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great variation of Lazarus was there to see them as they saw from exhausted, elderly, but hopeful people after long and often horrible trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the true sense of seeing the world from a perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue is talking to them the words of hope and the welcome you have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is, of course, not to recognise the perspective, Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not lighten the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black attracts Scottish members of the United Kingdom team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers at a time when only two shallots belonged to the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish Kontingent in the world championship team "will afford a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athlete was selected for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "something special has developed in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome we, and we are trying to understand, and we will continue to find out until we'll find out." said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I'm talking with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlets remember that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish Athlets are medals of medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir William Farah at the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle has chosen the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her chapters was incredible, "says black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Schottisch, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and true sense of course brought Eilidh quite naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, which will compete with their fifth world championships for the 400 m Hurdles, says it "believable" is that 16 shallots in the British squad are.</seg>
<seg id="145">The best total number of athletes at the world championship were seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-route Muir led to this path and has placed five British records and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate to the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, which is 1,500 m running, is another Scotsman that is going to be watching the victory at the British Team Trials and the 30th Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds of her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was in Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The European capitol states that it is "tremendously proud" on the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also among the medals and for the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"to be so special about the team captains, it is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, but to know that my teammate chose to me and chose something very special for me," added them.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I'm very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech considered as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it's just so great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from Browning's Facebook: do not apply to a public office if you don't have to wear the selector of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers tell him, from the interior policies to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He imminates with the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't bring his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">Because in the year 1783, Washington said: "the freedom of freedom can be removed - and, dumb and mute, we are led like sheep to battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who doesn't have to work anymore as Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan employees have blocked the posts of at least 450 people and erased out their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this week because of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The rod of the governor dropped the complaint as frivol and the online commentary was full of a counterpart with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people told.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's very important if it's like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor, in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary dog.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary resources to debutt with his voters and play his hairy head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons that come to the side of the governor - which is officially called the public forum, which is officially called and the employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Sprecherin Amelia grabbed the actions of Governors and argue that the amendment of the comments was nothing more than one moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of TROLLEN or hammam or hasserized people using the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked with some of the real people who were hooked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectable, thoughtful and not professed.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and commentated Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted but she asked for an enemy.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented, that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to felony and other current news," wrote it in the news area of the news show "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I appreciate this idea also, if a number of people on the same theme, then it will be accounted as a much more collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the staff members of the governor as "concentrated spam attack" would definitely call "intercede."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by blocked a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It's much cleaner than in previous days, when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to burn newspapers or demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this is just digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials that criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County had the last amendment, according to US-District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) was also received a visit from ACLU on its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington's time, the time of the plan had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers also multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous stamp stationed in his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters of newspapers, the Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping by Great Britain, was overwhelmed up with historical documents, which were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't bring them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression, opinion, and discretion are on the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guiding means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinal products) has begun with the implementation of tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should be more precise during the grounds of the age after the Swedish migrationsn (migrationsor) because of errors in the evaluation of the correct age of refugees who were accused of age.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, the Migration Agency has sent 6,880 to the testament and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results from a total of 2,481 trials from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>

<seg id="889">In 432 instances, the conclusion was that the person is maybe under 18 years old. "</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is being questioned.</seg>

<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant," he said the magazine The Local.</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England will probably announce that interest rates remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and slowdown inflation in inflation would have dampered over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "lazy as it kept by interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Bank's political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 for ensuring interest rates to 0.25%, whereby the weak economic growth has weakened a rise in this month, since weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase in growth.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6% and in 2018 it would be able to continue the pressure on the household income, whereby the inflation in autumn is expected to rise to almost 3%.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it was necessary that in the next few years of interest income would be cultivated, inflation and it said that the credit cost is possibly more than expected to rise to financial markets.</seg>

<seg id="1282">The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, resulting in the weak pound, which is compensated for a part of the lower consumer expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision proceeds a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU-vote, which caused the sinks of the Pfundia.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the final judgement of the Bank on interest rates, the call has risen to a interest rate, because inflation increased the pressure on a hard-adjusted households, with three political decision makers in July increased an increase to 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Inflation is reduced by 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the bank said that this was expecting and will be back in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clevere designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, fell from a big house in Knightsbridge at Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I looked after something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a quered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to insert Joanne Stauraum and a mezzanine level to optimal use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted to cease high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill who was able to use 12.5 feet high ceilings, not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overground, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine level where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">A fan had to think to solve the preset.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is pretty complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange spaces so well that they were confident that we had to bade us.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not only possible to build a simple platform, but on steel that he had to make the function upward or down the correct level. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed it to place two rooms in full height - with plenty of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">A classic copper light window from Retrouvius can be seen on the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting place the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">In both ends, a short corridor mirrored in order to make him longer work.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the squares and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The most special thing is that it is a door element.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit engineer was going in," explains the fan of the steel strengthened, veneered MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweight, so it is when you push the door, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated," says a fan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate can occur and can perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area, and at the same time use high quality materials, which provide the room its luxurious indulgence.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch, and therefore you can create an emotional connection in a home," says it.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself into the electric socket in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can transform themselves by a good design and increased square meters of somewhat clergy in something very amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide this not to leave.</seg>

<seg id="1388">The mumps of new Staberf plans to limit the media vote of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reported that the new Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to hold the boss on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, presented to his first day of staff, he introduced a main problem to President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that get into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better decisions, if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis make sense, but others have tried to see Trump by monitoring its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump relation to TV reaches for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its broadcasting is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate was angry because of a unfair report, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, trumps' habit consists of control, according to six former election campaign to ensure that his personal media consumption is an attractive praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that trumps has ever been "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe those campaigns know something we do not know - that trumps should not contain more combustible items without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets, which does not broadcast Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">When his associates have made it a few times, trouble-away from him, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it that trump caused crackers.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem consists in dealing with people in a White House, composed of competing parties, bringing ever again to present their own Agenda by proving curump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - that deals with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors to infect the president of strategical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane gold-makers:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and ex-ump-officials say that Trump is acting as a volcano on negative press clippings, mainly such with damaged leciks, and that he would find out on it, from where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Precisely that happened at the end of February, when somebody gave a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocation, Charles C. Johnson, who described the source behind a heap to be at his at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banned from Twitter, or that he has no concrete evidence that he has been uttered in the past and revoke them in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold-emaker added that the then Chief of Staff of Sence Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to capture and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same for three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make the's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. special investigator awarded Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russian affair with U.S. president Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is meant to have a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The Panel recorded work over the past few weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under appeal to this cause.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper valued the step as a sign that Mueller is widened and intensifying his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN transmitter reported that there is already first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between mumps and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services acquires the Kremlin for longer, specifically aimed at the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were interference between Trump campaigns team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are aimed at campaigns of the Republican Countries.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also took private and more mumps private and commercial environment under the magnifying.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special educator Trump personally presented the centre and the rejection to disassemble the president in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to consider and decide the evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether the charge should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are turned on when it is about bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always made behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by public prosecutors to download perception, by persons.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, CNN stations have already been issued to shoot the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting, were asked for a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">You should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Next to Trump Jr. also Trump advisors and law-law Jared Kushner and his then his manager Paul Manafort was in conversation with Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right wing said on Thursday evening in U.S. television, that the confidation show that Mueller could not be resolved in his work, and he if it should be necessary quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it is not inevitably hot that the Grand Jury will be turned on in order to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the proceeds of the committee of the beginning of a new phase into investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Among the new disclosure, the President on Thursday evening discusses a speech in West Virginia to depicting Russia's affair as a campaign for his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The issue give the Democrats a way to feel good, because they don't have anything else you can talk about that. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb declared in a statement, he knoweth nothing from a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But I usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House wore any measures to accelerate the work of the special exchange at "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chef James Comey said three times that won't be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to accept that something was changed, called it in the Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey was fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rebel was allegous against Trump, he would like to hinder the justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June, Comey exchanged in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him for an employment of investigations against the former national security advisor Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under large pressure due to the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculations of what Trump Mueller are relieved.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special investigation of the congress, such as in the Watergate-affair, Richard Nixon has caused a position to renew a position in which he might have fired on pushing the President of the President of the Justice of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators were dismissed on Thursday, after which the special investigator could no longer be released.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: huge Eisberg moves in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctic a gigantic iceberg has solved the barely seven times in Berlin from Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The about a trillion tonne and 5800 sq km of the Koloss driver now drive to the north and will probably be two, three years until it was melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is a total of 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ice giant, the researchers have registered in the last three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people do not expect from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what climate change has played a role at the breakdown of the Iceberges, it is clear after research ations.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, the U.S. research centre for snow and ice cream (NSIDC) in a facsimile background for about 30 years, however, give an unusual collapse of ice creations in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, that could be related to warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The Koloss has now been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swimming in the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is always growing up to the sea and leaves regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeises was the balance of waxes and disrupting some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis is broken down there, AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are some evidence that also the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is at risk, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as presently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stand under tension and can fall apart, in case of a key place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melt of Schelfeis and Eisberg will not increase the sea level as they staggered by water as much water as it gives after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, loss of Shelfeises leads to the glacier directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level but only in a low extent, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest scarcity of Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the junction from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, along the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"though there's a natural look and consciously aware of a direct link to climate change, the shield comes now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of records," he confirmed too.</seg>

<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher disclose this gigantic Iceberg don't decline to climate change, so many shades of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long time on Antarctica extends toward South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">Based on data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Iron area of the Antarctic Peninsula have passed 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">At the decline of the temperature rise was contributed.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula was warmed about three degrees in the past 50 years, and counted towards the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1562">The aim is to provide not just short-term threats to explore, but to adoption the application of applicants, it is called.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented and on the outside, concrete measures for cross-ups and an vocational offensive, require CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circuit has to do it with personal problems they do not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities hire good civil servants and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a real "competition of public employer."</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not have any new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how to continue working," said Minister Marco Minni in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came in a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of German aid organisation 'Youth Reset', because their crew had worked closely with human traffers in a way that immigrated the illegal immigration.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn / league is suitable for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars in future be sitting before computer consoles, instead of fighting the wind and weather about the adians shave?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: E-sport is long ago to a serious business, become a lucrative business - wide stars, millions fans and huge tournaments with high gifts.</seg>
<seg id="1615">We recognized this was recognized by the first federal states that is increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">At the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg won, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently in the VfB Stuttgart, founded in mid-July an e-sport department and two professionals took place among the FIFA World Cup 17.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope this will inspire all new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1618">It is certainly to climb on this train even some clubs. "</seg>
<seg id="1619">At the coming weekend, FIFA World Cup in London organized the first "Interactive Club World Cup" to compete against the Gamer of various clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg were qualified, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-Trainer by Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen currently advises a agency for virtual soccer players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football, especially with the 14 to 30-year-old know that young people will continue to enter into the stadium," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: attempts to tempt all possible markets, especially the Asian, to conquer.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen, one could have a presence in more often on these markets, when only once a year, the federal structure returned to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What are it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">With the e-sport games like "League Of Legends," Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or FIFA, the Football-Simulation are challenged at competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sport, the professionals have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And for Asia play, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a correct sports?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is sure to be used.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobial has left himself a long time with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For Professor at the German Sports- University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sports because he is competitiful and many biological and physical reactions which you can also find heart rate frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also need cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reveness.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamer should not only exercise in the console but also exercise their body and take care of nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the best player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">Frobial doesn't see problems: "Doping is getting more on a theme."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult at online games, and in the scene there were the structures of classical Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists prove positive impact on the E-Sports field.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are international roads, this is like a global family, there are no intercultural shirts.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of the consultancy between Deloitte and the Federation of Interactive maintenance software (BIU) does not say rapid growth ahead of the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, more than 50 million euros have been implemented, mainly about advertising, sponsorship, and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">With about 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga, this is little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-Sport "is not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writing the Deloitte consultant.</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Large markets are Asia and the U.S., where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez were involved in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSport-competition Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot in Europe too.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In a Norwegian school E-sport was introduced as a teaching, says Frobial.</seg>
<seg id="1651">In the Netherlands and in France the soccer match is obliged according to Dutt, in the meantime required to set up a e-sport part.</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison Germany, VfB Executive Board explains Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1653">Only in nostalgia fall, and the old times are too horrified, this is no longer sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1654">Therefore, it is possible to keep the tradition of the association, but the company at the same time as a modern market.</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digital world," says Dutt.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter found because of the texts, murdering Conrad's Roy To suicide</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her boyfriend to suicide and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence after alleged and five years were exposed to local currency.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was convicted in June due to a rapid killing of Conrad Roy, who took the life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is inseparable.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter allowed to stay free until calling.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representative argument that she suffered from psychic illness.</seg>
<seg id="1669">In red trousers and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when they was condemned.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have taken Conrad's Roy," said the public prosecutor in the court.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"she finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">She has taken no responsibility, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="1673">"it has no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carer said attorney, it is a "awful passage that they totally regret."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Judge Lawrence Moniz said, he did not find that her "age or tyre, or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A public prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said it, "there is no day that I don't smoke the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">I want him to be proud of me and as I go with everything. I try to be able to bear with all my pain, which we will be for eternity with us for his sisters. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1678">Roys sister, Camudyn Roy said that it will be persecuted by the realization "to participate in the wedding of her brother or would be an ante for his children.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be an illegal precedence, since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case withdrew national attention on himself, after carters revealed texts that they had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>

<seg id="1684">In the moment ahead of his suicide they wrote: "you must do it, Conrad, and" everything you've got to do is the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Richter Moniz said that Carter acknowledged attention through the death of Roy and ordered it to profit from any press to the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To the few, the Carter defended, belonged to Amanda Knox, who was convicted for murder of her British co-resident in Italy before two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published in the Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter's sympathy and help, no prison."</seg>
<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimmi: learn from the new Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">Joshua Kimmi, at the Audi Cup, was actually no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern trimmed the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation seemed not there.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Something was different on his place in the cabin, which looked Joshua Kimmi immediately, even if the additional piece of clothing is very, very small.</seg>
<seg id="1693">But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer has been seen, he made himself a hurry to his arm.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the trainer never announced it," told the Confed Cup winner after his first use as Bayern-Kapitän.</seg>
<seg id="1695">Good, the one could have better run than at 0: 2 vs. SSC Naples.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But Kimmi could interpret the sign of Coach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen from youth players, debutants, and just chosen by the holiday professionals existing C-Elf as game guide, but he.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Sugar is considered at the best to those who wants to keep a lot, who wants to keep you in the mood.</seg>
<seg id="1699">So who was chosen to enter the Lame of Lahm, a small extra motivation can only use a little extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimmi confirmed: "that's what you want to do as a player."</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old served as a mini-Lahm over the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Right back, that's his position, the white binde on the arm put its evil.</seg>
<seg id="1703">And at all, Kimmi played in this startinformation like the one who can take the ruder also best in his hand.</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave orders to direct the unrinsed troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had the look for the whole, while many others were busy himself.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Vidal to replay his missing Fitness (dashed hard); Renato Sanches thus, on the devils descending on the achievements of Asia-travel (it's also conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle thus did not fall negative in their first appearance in Bavaria-Trikot.</seg>
<seg id="1707">This still worked out very well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">In addition to Kimmi, Rudy slept in front of the defense, both agates sovereign.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The well-occupied Napoli storm is often difficult, in addition, Süle tried to grow a few times in the game-up.</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy gave to say that the result was "not as we hoped ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he showed a good performance in the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">Game settings, change: "for this style I was also recovering."</seg>
<seg id="1713">As usual, this Bayern world is still for new additions, one saw in connection to the game.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Rudy to the catacombs not one or two, but determines six or seven interviews.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimmich passed after a few crackling statements in the back of his new players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">There he heard of the south an interesting proposition: "which descends here, I have already noticed.</seg>
<seg id="1717">You just have to win each game in Bavaria. "</seg>

<seg id="1722">The Bayern Legionary is a quasi-mate of ÖFB captains into Schnaderbeck and fever together with our shoys.</seg>

<seg id="1725">Company satisfied with rheinland-caring ministers: Economy loaves Wissings pace</seg>
<seg id="1726">The relationship between the country and regional economy is often stamplified, as Eveline Lemke (Green) still was an economic Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This shows itself according to more than one year, where the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V Inquiry for a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old ministries.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Frank Natus, president of the association Trierer Company (VTU), says: "Wissing attacks the desires of the economy, the Lemke allesamt has blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The largest sweeping reflects in the Infrastructure policy: the close proximity to the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau stands at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">In this year, the ministry is hoping for a planning process, until 2021 the device is supposed to stand.</seg>

<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains however.</seg>
<seg id="1740">At the planned road construction we can quickly create facts, at the same time, the country lacked staff, says Jan Glockauer, the managing director of the IHK Trier.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Only 29 places has been occupied by 56 new engineers to employ knowledge in the country's local business.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The IHK claims to be awarded with orders to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">As a result, CDU-Group vice-out Christian Baldauf refers to the calculation of the bill in 2017 and by 2018, more than 20 million euros invested more in receipt of country roads as proposed.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank Natus still expects a concept of the country to make use of skilled business in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Consequently, the old broadband extension is also in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1746">In 2016, the regional company had only rated the supply of power supply in an IHK survey only with the Note 3.4.</seg>
<seg id="1747">They complained about stockings and outbreaks.</seg>

<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary to submit perceptions and abdominal feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, business people, journalists who are suspected to stand on the housing list of the Government or the Karting, a catalogue of crime, making the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no resting rest of violence, and throughout the country the bodies of the bodies, there are always more journalists: at least 25 years since the president Enrique Pena Nieto gave up his office. 589 they have been on state protection and so far there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is the editor and their inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico, and Valdez wrote in one of its numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, though his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his midfinger with the word "Justice" depicts on the facade of the Riodoce-building. two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry t-shirts, which will show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discussed about their shared issues, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">While in 2010, a sonata's Attorney was established to process the cases of journalists, according to the committee, it was initiated by two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with the majority of thousands of murder, every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murders of journalists are rarely issued before the court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">With Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa although it is uneasy, although the terrain is still more avenged.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting is a little benefit of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to wear my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why we do not."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the country's capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla had to be stopped by two men. he was shot and sentenced to him for 12 time, probably due to the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "12th."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Scaffolding tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is virtually nothing in the topic of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans has been arrested in the United States last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloody battlefields of the country, as rivalerating factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">There's nothing to be shot in Sinaloa every day or more people shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of enchanting, two-story mausolean for drug might that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Just forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with valuable harbours and drugs-trading companies in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt he was not fortified to his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaled antitrust fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, probably the sake of the edition received as soon as they delivered to newspaper kiske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault lay in that Valdez was not windy up, after the confiscation of another newspaper, who had published the same story, the country too his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long been living for his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined the establishment of five colleagues in the establishment of Riodoce and sold for 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without saying anything to the bootloom problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time the newspaper had a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it to publish hard treffing studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were captivated by a publication in which they could read stories, that nobody had to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage during the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave him that he had trouble.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Eintrafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I did not want to be asked: "what have you done in the so many things... why did you not say what went ahead?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who curse the fun, the friend who was generous with hugs and hits, a teacher, who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted to his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Salinas, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine become a routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own concerns about how they do best and keep up their work.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their proper start- and runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a great measure of self-interest and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it is wrong, whereabouts of it away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as it and other words, apply in Sinaloa, no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mix of lucrative dirt roads, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the members of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones required. days before it was known that Spyware is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two police officers tried protection outside the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the local government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a central area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in jest, some of the reporter asked whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the policemen, who described the governor himself as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is for months, since the reporter has gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug abuse has been facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce made up three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was an assassination of the brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">You also had an exposé to the state spending that concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that wandered in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from office of the office building, an abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped, so it was careful when it was time to write what everyone in town: that the restaurant is a favorite local group of drug traffers and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1880">Reporters learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politician, which ruled the ruling Institutional revolution Party (pri), which ruled almost all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors have been accused of corruption due to the high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal begged the reporter, writing about previous incidents in this eating one, including one that passed into a military attack by "El Chapelle" Guzman.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier the reader mentioned the column of Valdez as the best informal source of the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murders by journalist, because the employees have become something of what they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Mr. Miriam Ramirez snap himself a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to visit the office of the district.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and official announcements, based on DNA tests that it's its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists were loud and written by the "SOS Press" protests in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to compensate and destroy them, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since been asked since it is dealt with by the government, because it is concerned that their rage has injured its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez was repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico had been organised by organised crime to intergovernmental government officials and a contributable society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote not only to be killed by drugs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces that were with the organized crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group group "Articulo 19" added more than half of the attacks against journalists of police and officials last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you will die, because you would like to hold the mouth," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murderous effect have an aberrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in northern borders of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that allegedly signed by Zetas Kartell, "I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">There is a computer keyboard and earphones next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to conclude like the newspaper El Norte in the northern State of Chihuahua, after the assassination of the correspondent MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to continue like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly exhibited the drug-cartels with a title page on the title page "What do you want of us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are fled out of their home country or even from country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile and still watch the streets and seek dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted and obviously the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who together with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz was murdered.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue their stay and continue, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, gives him that the drug trafficking him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell and so I became a reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce restarted on the sidewalk before the office and drank of beer when all her telephones were started.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shale measures with bandenrivalen and security forces near the spa centre Mazatlan had left the dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the border stony they published their news on the site of Riodoce on mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The frontpage had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens hew near - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez designed a look at the police officers, to see whether they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose Midfinger was visible for all Sinaloa, the members of Riodoce followed its marks.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"as you can only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day when Javier was murdered, the intern called me for about to send them back to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, when a terrifying day.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinoceros are so well received that experts have described as "Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that she could even identify that his scaly skin was brown - and they said, it could have had something from an untroubled past. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report on the magazine "Current Biology" called it as "the preserved dinosaurs, who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Krems time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preservated condition, researchers that describe it as a "truly remarkable"</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the Armored plant resource is the best preserved Fossil in its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, as he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed from the surrounding cliff lacked in Platze, and decided to look at more precise.</seg>
<seg id="1932">Fossil discovered it was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) of heavy crude wrens.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"when you blink only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it was not slept." said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature has to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is going to enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this plant preivores, though it is covered with an armor, with a changing breastplate, probably threatened by meats of dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators, and used as a shield, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix himself better in its surroundings, and say to its enemies, say, what indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has been headheadlines in May and is now shown in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in May.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now have studied the wild beast and it was called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the MuseumEngineers Mark Mitchell, one of a team who gave more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the car enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of dragging and armour to his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the chatment, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature has been darker than its bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the formatment is common, the results are surprisingly, because the size of Borealopelta is by far the survivors of the living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by eating meats in dinosaurs that evolution was favorable to overcoming the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the concubines - think of Rehe, Zebras or Gürshtiere - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey what signposted that this Nodossier was exposed to a real battle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong spacecraft behaviour on a massive, strongly armoured dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the crab time," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the dinosaurine was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists will continue to investigate the animal on critics of his life, including its conservative Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, into a river, and pushed out into the sea, where he sank into the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was like southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with a preservated skin, but it remains in three dimensions and preserved the original form of animal welfare." said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early creation time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to construct it. if you're only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The creation time was a time when huge Theropods, dehydration dinosaurs, who rose on two legs, ground up the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopoelta lived, the armoured dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In addition, the Acrocanthosaurus belongs to a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tonnes of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose most recent findings in current biology appear to believe that Borealopoelta turned out after the death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, as he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved Dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle until chump.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were weighed on average for about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pound (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops, which ragged by its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers think that the armoured crops were sweeping across the western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater implication of the Dinosaurriers confronted its armor in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified wood remains of this special edition is so good that the skin remains still cover holprige caraples along the Dinosaurante</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the Lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confusing it will.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Resized Rests of the skin still cover the bumpy caraples, which carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right-foot is lying on his side, his five fingers are spread up.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the sheds at his sole.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: massacre on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Hefty accident on Thursday night on the A8: nearly 30 cars are involved in a massacre.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are lots of injured, kilometers- and barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), some 20 people were injured during the late afternoon afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data, the police were against 17.00 o'clock in the junction Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (local district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 cars, including probably lorries, sloped.</seg>
<seg id="1976">No data is given to the exact number of recent developments.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It is a light to moderate injury, a police officer said.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A great ascended to rescue vehicles was in the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, there was a ten-kilometer long rear stau.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like a AZ-reporter, it also appeared on the back-track to massive disabilities - by numerous barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade notched the number of vehicle lenker, which now have been reckoned with sensitive criminal charges.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 I took a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Wases.</seg>
<seg id="1984">It was a collision between a car transport and a car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It's a moment that almost everyone has witnessed at least: nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or it is deepened in his work and has just a great thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Will the sheer and wakes an improper or ride the ride in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Chassis control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The German railway currently tested the map sheet monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="1994">Just approved by phone that you can take its place and take advantage of the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a trial run on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"is the offer, we'll expand it from.</seg>
<seg id="1997">In the beginning of the year, it is expected to be available on many other remote routes in Germany, "said an train speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the path card devaluation without sheeptions.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to use them, however, some conditions have to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And one must have booked an online ticket - what should most of the passengers do already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You have also to have purchased about the App, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient method of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And at last you need a seat.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works as: one climbs into the train, calling his ticket under "My Tickets".</seg>
<seg id="2004">During the test customer, a button will appear on electronic validation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The tractor leads to your mobile devices such a message that bikes X is on the train and took the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the ticket control room has reached number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already purchased online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue, keep on.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the rail, which is to be utilised in the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel without ticket control through our permission team does not wish to travel in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables passengers to create their journey on the train personal, "says Michael Peterson, marketing executive board of DB.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to deal to the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Who often travel, knows that next to delay and missed lines the ticket controls are among the largest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, in any case, one of the Mitreisenden is not all necessary documents which you need to devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either a credit card or the ID card or a document there must be required.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between the companion and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the partitions or large-space and delays in control of their own tickets and will take care of the workers at the end of the time.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Even, only a small number of testers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that is only available on the joints of ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Other train features on the same route are not yet unlocked yet.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core on 9 August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the child sitting in St. Louis, on the bed of a airbnb apartment that rented it and scroll through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post of somebody from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and there still is still on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, because nobody else had posted information on her feed, she completed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saving on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old man who was killed by a white officer in Ferguson, Mo., was live to tweeter.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of browns that was stretched out on the road and had to stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," said Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She finished her cell phone, later to return to Tweet via people on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police and people that cried out, and of a man who claimed to be a shield with the inscription: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed an live feedback, where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with an inverted dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video said she, assured another policeman, his rifle, and cried, "I will kill you..." all of you will kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell's remembering her sayings.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and which we can call."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt bowls.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and weeping. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">It booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive on the next morning after Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the topic of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protests, the love and power of power, which exists in fellowship and power of resistance, which live in fellowship and streets, to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As a Ferrel with her daughter, worshipped a floral design and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times in this morning, "about black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember what I have taught you when black people have to fight in what they believe?" they remembered what she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson because the police had a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I couldn't say it, "Ferrell later said.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and pulled it up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have a fortune to give her a experience in which she doesn't have an eclatex racism, it is no different than the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel that I would have a bad service to keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when it arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a town opposite the police station which was built to a camp site, when the activists waited for the impossible not-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped them to transfer them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly, a new kind of activism started to take shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has completely changed after 9 August," said she and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Ntoral association and focused on food and health inequalities in black congregations.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met in the evening demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar decided only to document what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question occurred Ferrell in the meaning: "would you document or try to find a story you can take out?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of incense - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we had heard that people who have been born and raised in Ferguson and have not centered their voices and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the then Co-director Damon Davis, a artist from the area called for his activism around Todestrakt Needs.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose troets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talk to us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me as these people will be presented, for I will be presented."</seg>

<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives as she marries and married their wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the purification of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeatedly wins the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of movement, who have strongly influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media after the killing of the black Teenagers in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement together," said Ferrell, "and thus we are constantly fighting at various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must bear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Folayan agreed to remember that "the movement is truly held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is, however, that "this is not a affirmative type of action," where Ferrell has been selected as a heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who raised her energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although it was on the front front, because at these cruises than a black, gay woman stands so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">The news from Ferguson has already disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police are still standing.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell has at local currency for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls their home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">However, she felt at an voice and she feels committed to this memory, since three years ago it went to the street in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they are not built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone have outdated the population in sovereigners and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the subject hardly leaves a cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While those of a bit say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker), "comes from the other side:" no man does not need "(Siggi banding) or simply:" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocate is designed to lay out a gallery more clients into the city, whatever the other shops, fear the opposition, that then the pedestrian precipts are exploited.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Additionally, the gallery is planned to be exactly on the property where the market hall is in the 13 direct selling its products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of construction work will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery paintings want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely the Beda square with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the market market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm have always been very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also that.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if a direct mark in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But it could probably not be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "for what shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothes, footwear, drugs or supermarkets: I think it is unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shops are empty here - some since months and years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is so important that at least keeping us the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For at least the merchandise is fresh, mainly offered directly from the product and is insufficiently at the price.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As one sees, shop business will be rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies because the lesions are often not trageous for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions exists almost no more and what is still left, will probably also disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the market hall be throughout the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already create the ghosts program before expel all the business from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center which is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a pepale market, there is no place thanks to the wacute many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the market hall is headquartered, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist gets portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unstrange - those are connected to cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits have been created by the artist Heather Decwey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupside and haircuts, which were sent to you by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former intelligence was served as a 35 year-old prison sentence after they opened as a home in diplomatic announcements on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was to be transformed into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transine and a pioneering dissident, when he was only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted from Manning, and from the 30 portraits could not only look like somebody, as it can be interpreted and the infirmament Determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, which was born as Bradley Edward, but since its puberty was said openly about the identification as a woman, it was found in 2013 because of 20 charges against the spy network, computer workers and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so very that there was only one single picture - a grainy, black-white Selfie, sitting in the man sitting on a driver's seat and a platinum blonde is associated with that it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just back from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger VISIONS'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist portraits of stranger artificides from forensic artifacts like candy store and chewing gum that they extracted DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when they received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg stated at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not attend this time and could not take pictures, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained mice were to unequal letters that exchanged several letters during the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even looked at one of Shoili's canungo illustrated Comic "Suppression images" which would predict a future where the president of Chelseas would be able to see the show personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In fact, Obama truly became a few days after the book was published, Manning was asking for seven brutal years in a military jail in Kansas so it was a welcome way of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" it is now on the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads to war fighting and against Transgender troops to avoid the rigid split, which he really ought to stand further.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the weird timing of all these things, she said that "things could happen for a specific reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a particular name written in the gallery in the gallery, the man called for the maning with its vast signature (the "i" in their family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic breakdown, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written a thousand foothler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg allows you to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed academic dictionary of the artist), as amazing, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take of hope that we are not just caring who we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, their video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that are 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the mentioned Comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges with a free phone, in the hand of the United States, like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they chill your speech, then they won," it says.</seg>
<seg id="2151">"it's never simply the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," said the artist you greet from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still keep goose if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room, from their own genomic simacons, like hordes of protesting.</seg>
<seg id="2155">That was also targeted as everything in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Mannings stature), with haphaplogroups were written with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it feels like a mass movement that feels to Chelsea like the movement, which also behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Vice premier Vitaly Mutko said, I will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for restoring the Russian anti-Doping Agency (Rusada).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a particular stage, the criteria of the schedule of the schedule of the schedule of Rusada has the right to plan and test with UKAD (UK anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect, "explained 'Mutko on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA to compliance with the code which describes the criteria for the reintegration of Rusada, and was recently published on the website of the organization.</seg>

<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future. "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list of these criteria represents that the Russian anti-Doping authorities agree that the Russian anti-Doping authorities agree with the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren too alleged state-sponsored doptics in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">In terms of the matter, Mutko said: "we introduce the test, because our anti-Doping system has collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">But there was no state programs, and we won't be admit what does not exist. "</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos words agree with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-Doping Commission.</seg>

<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad conduct and to recognise, saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of this year amidst the Uber-Fall in Miscredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Converting has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="2222">And when the chief advisor is involved, complaints can go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of public opinion covers the regulators" said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found, that holds up his employees either badly or is unethical, it may experience cost consequences by consumers' boycott, worker cayment and lawsuits, says Quinlan.</seg>

<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to sign a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company centre, suggestion a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a bad experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said, there was no good way to pursue the complaints of staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, since the company convercent, problems that were hidden from executives, have been hidden in offices in cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with jobs," Vitrano rides the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people employed hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your Software as a service, and loads the company with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors. both start-ups are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the entire capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Sparkle secured a $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture partners and raised its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising in view of the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research, showing that today's employees expect more than so far.</seg>
<seg id="2240">Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only.</seg>

<seg id="2259">NCAA is eliminating two days practices and makes a long day for the Bruins</seg>
<seg id="2260">It goes to 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA footballers undergo on one side of the teams in the campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have drawn their tricotoxies and show the back at a sweat of the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team this one-two minutes represent a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled to the summer break, will return after the three-hour practise, before they return to the next morning at 6: 30am to the National Football Center.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is the next three days a real tretmill," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before the Monday of Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and she actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three trainings of UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to justify the already packed times of the player.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise route from the two days is more than one day, passed by at the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time while Moras played practical exercises during the summer school.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are expected to hold 18 exercises during the course of August 18. before beginning of formal game preparations for their kick off against Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">MORA said that he supports the NCAA division's change, even if they add the preoccupied routes of the players a further point.</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we lay these enormous strain on three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they simply expresses them, they move on, they are great people.</seg>
<seg id="2272">I think you come back to Saturday and we have more time it will really be great. "</seg>
<seg id="2273">The UCLA will end their practices as soon as the camp end is finished, which is covered by a clear view of its fields from a adjacent parking place and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of a high-rise apartment, which was already stored in a gate behind a door bull, no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Brun players will occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora dreamed that there might be a problem if these rooms are free during the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it's not far to think that people rent there a room and then set it to record a practice.</seg>
<seg id="2277">If you have video observer from an exercise, it is a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="2278">But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.</seg>
<seg id="2279">We will do the best with what we have.</seg>

<seg id="2284">The company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods and send them to invoive that may display the results of the facsimile examination out of the original article.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2286">The problem has become a major political topic in Europe, whereby the French voters in the presidential elections were overflooded in May with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to be punished by the social media networks such as before the elections in September quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a Comic-novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In its younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-he was a loophole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history of his homely Shelter at the Arent River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophairy Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of somebody who has been dead for 300 years," he says weary.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'sailed the time from the Middle Ages up to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scotney. Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes which is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other News', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was an emotional wise.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb pressure on the page of a letter, who was written by a double act in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins." he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smelled to smoke, as then there was a fire because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the odor has a effect as if he himself was.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love Archive! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so with old paperings it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England. "to be honest, I really seems to be a little oversize") this all seems too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle, making the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the mong-heads of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He migrated through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapes, gardening, and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, he transcribe "Whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access, when the last visited, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees just started to worry about the archive that he said as "hundreds of years ago in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it to the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Tagebte, letters from the period of the English empires, maps, which are saying, "one could mean that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go his way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection are using the castle as a starting point to invade the wider basis of the English history, including 'The Labourer', which leaves a man to join the newly built castle in order to join the farmers of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there's a record from a riot who occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasantry was in this field and I thought, a surrection was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are confused in the history of the castle - as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patented, hidden the family of Darrell for seven years.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', presented in the 18th century smugglers, who filled his own funeral by a sarg with stones (a discovery that was formed only years later when his sarg was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's family of Scotney: "to be the gentlemen of lawful Gauner, making their debts and make money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men dissolved their debt crisis by having rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys, with a talent to advertise fatigue. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his use in the castle Rhodes in search of other unique speciming experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about spurishes from the early 20th century, which has been re-called again by nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney got a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go again," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like: "Oh, now I must cope with the damned life."</seg>

<seg id="2324">With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef has started its campaign to launch a new roof brand (Rundschau von Thursday).</seg>
<seg id="2325">Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want to hold the logo and the slogan.</seg>
<seg id="2326">At the end of August it will be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Grafenwerth.</seg>
<seg id="2327">"too beautiful for us.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Or?, "asks Macher's action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer chapel.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan anxiety about the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) performed on pensioners and surveys.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So this week also.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine at the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The session took place in the General Staff Building, like the former, but in the office of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">In the consultations under the presidency of the Government, the Five Vice-Presidents also and the Minister for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">So they were civilians in the mean number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government pulls the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Walter usi Akar, Chief of staff, remains in office, but the commander of the host, the Air Force and the Navy were removed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup d "ép ground Erdogan has fired momentary chogan 169 of 326 generals and Admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Exile-Preacher Fethullah Gülen, in the Erdogan as a dragon head of the coup.</seg>
<seg id="2349">At 486 persons, which was supposed to have been involved directly at the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since that week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup Erdogan referred to the crash test as a "Divine gift," he had the opportunity to give him the armed forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But Erdogan has really in touch with Erdogan?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article by the heading "Unbehagen in the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there is concerns of an increasing "Islamization" of the army that manifested among others in raising the headscarf ban for soldiers, the paper wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The large-purification of the army and the security forces continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Erdogan sent another 7395 military service by decree in mid-July, among them 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">However, Erdogan seemed to be tamed of the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the real masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times, she cared her role as the role of worldly state of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002 Erdogan imposed the power of the military group by step, not least regarding the reformative of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say the Erdogan driver deliberately staging an Islamization of armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a particularly well-known officer who seeks to ask for the coup attempt by distress and persecution in foreign countries, the Turkish army will be filled with extreme extremists and salafists within a few years.</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, the Nato could not be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Anyway, there is no doubt in the Allianz after the purge of the Turkish army.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Management structures and operational skills are "weakened," say Nato diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Washington changes the rules for Green Card</seg>

<seg id="2367">He looks ahead of reducing the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stringent regulations for the proceeding of visas for a temporary working permit and limitations for families-oriented visas.</seg>
<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by republicans and supported by the President.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"this law will reduce poverty, wages and billion dollars for taxpayers, and will continue to change the way in the US as the citizens from other countries will be transfered."</seg>
<seg id="2371">The law will prevent the fetters on migration and replace the current system.</seg>
<seg id="2372">This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak english for themselves and knowledge that will benefit from our economy, "says Trump, quoted by the American media.</seg>
<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rebreak the track for racing shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over the past few months, the future of the race shuttles had been controversial - now it should go fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year the travel lane is scheduled to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the road for the long-term, according to information from the traffic Ministry is scheduled to begin work on the track this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to continue to order the circuit Ilmenau-Rennbridge, and confesses the country to this especially for tourism," announced public prosecutor Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the route paid to about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country is 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country, shall presumably be voted, stated Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the southern urban rail as a operator can be found at the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"the timetable that provides vehicles and quality standards," said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned agreement between the Ministry and the Rail Service will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This should be the most easy-to-fly shuttle on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The racing shuttle is an especially popular rail connection between Ilmenau railway stations and a race course.</seg>
<seg id="2386">In the course of a pilot plant, in the course of a pilot plant has been tested whether the distance of many people will be used to order again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also strongly dilapidated in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can not be crazy as 2017, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take up their ascent seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can select the lens of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the company deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexydolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm, with aware of human reactions which can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt its robot according to his beliefs "and select it all, from the eye-paint of the robot about the shape of the nipples up to the type or color of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be alarming as many robots who would like "personalities" would look like a Stepford-woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexydolls have developed to robots using a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to customize its users to adapt their robots to the properties, as for example, for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" giving the impression of relentity and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is as good as possible," is warmed the site of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she also has their moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired of being a conversation, or she can be "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many alarming aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the entertaining female characteristics, with one step to Frigid (i.e. here: contexorable) Farrah is fading, and the most common one.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a Vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it is called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots don't only have a coffee table or just another sextoys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing refinement refer to something dark and deeper in our culture, on a withdrawal from the Ideal to the sexes towards a wish after sex with submission as an optional allowance.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most of the males will of course stop sex robots, while the FRR noticed their increasing popularity, however, they remain temporary at the edge of the consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what comes from the edge zones can be seeped in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very teachable.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting, until they are admitted to them the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain subargain that this highly developed sex robots in a time occurring in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which in the White House there is a president, who thus boosted women and being attacked by women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most awesome aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the worn out bodies and the well-equipped eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment, this doesn't feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots there is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar Proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their peacies want to feel human beings that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, at the point, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots don't represent any real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They don't have a background or background history, nothing which could disturb the imagination total undergain.</seg>
<seg id="2422">It is different: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the reform agenda by 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Mumps high performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the byword of the healthy human spirit</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binary code of the ump-era that the political split, which have polarized the US voters, have divided families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Ernsting danko there were newspapers in the US newspapers, with advice about how to handle tears of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We strapping us all the supposedly, to let our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of mumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-directed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family to visit me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They remembered that the unity may have a strong enemy against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With a ump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican relationship, with which she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to the dining table this is certainly a good thing but it falls in another context that this also brings considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the graceful way that his cookies won't be toggled for one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a long-term long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the Right wing "normalized," suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as the epitome of extermination.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself from an active nostalgic version of the landfall - the dog on the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how the tax returns) - which occur in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump comes, the next candidate of republicans must be just spiritual, to qualify for immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the Carusel in Central Park, the biggest of the Carousel, New York Parkour, and the best three dollars that can be sold in the city if no caffeine is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs at the central cylinder - all clowns are cryred and the animals are turning to look at full fear about their own shoulders - very gloomy and climatic music give it a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a town disappoint: the views of high buildings are old when Skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not entirely over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is, there is no Swiss cottage - the themes Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a great roundabout in the north London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Central Park karussell is still a strange experience, since there are two two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s that can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">When I could shave the carousel, I could have given a full score, but fortunately nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In coffee bar on the corner of my road, it is the same as plus the option to pay by a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also put pressure on the server to bring personality in a situation, which is no necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excitingly grinsing, while I tired the experience he had to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison into the hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison for the second time at a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of incessings, he was tortured by a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder on an appeal in the prosecutors.</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in the survey.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group have offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve the emission of emission standards Euro 5 and some Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesels or worse are exempted.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe there are estimates:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates will only apply to the vehicles that have the Schuman software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The retrofitting has arranged the KRAFTFLIGHT-Federal Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The makers have announced an immediate implementation in the next few months, but not yet exact dates.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has shared, to attribute each person concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If you have an inspection, it will be done in its framework.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long should the retrofit lie down?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"difficult to say" says Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The appendices from the manufacturer's commitment as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen voluntarily acting the automaker on the subject of environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">The time elaborate could be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers do, who do not drive a car of BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE will be waiting for.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Presumably foreign manufacturers would move, thus smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is a massive price reduction of Euro-4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE will not be afraid.</seg>

<seg id="2524">One of the laureates doesn't want to come - from protest.</seg>
<seg id="2525">LL Cool J (49) gets the first ever approaching awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="2526">As the performers were announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).</seg>
<seg id="2527">Prizes will be delivered in early December.</seg>

<seg id="2529">The award winner will be announced by the progressive TV series of Lear announced that there is no participation in the Gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">"new York Times," he said: "this presidency has decided to neglect the fine arts and human rights - even the means to escape - and it burdened me."</seg>
<seg id="2531">The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify their viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Following the former president John F. Kennedy, Kennedy-Zentrum is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.</seg>

<seg id="2534">We make the city life worth</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haskachs Stadtbaumeister, goes to pension next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The site is already written - suitable applicants are rar.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years, keeper of the Stadtbaumeister.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as he mediates in the press meetings.</seg>
<seg id="2539">It talks of varied, but challenging tasks that wait for its successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, I admire him to fulfil the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for the nearest possible time a architects or engineer engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus - by respecting the regular cancellation conditions - still plenty of time for a drafting.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach was acting for the administration community as an enterprise authority, the applicants must propose appropriate financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city straight.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If no longer wish to replenish them, people would have to navigate up to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But citizenship be of the city and himself, says Wacker that reports from a good operating climate and a good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">Some important projects have accumulated in office for more than 30 years, looking back with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city life worth," he is safe about the building and staff.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla Areas and the Dutch car park is around.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium is still a theme.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone will suffice with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," appreciates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Design days be available for a city building with great play room.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Haslachs own own building yard and gardeners can be flexibly responsive to many.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move much," so Wacker, and the design of the founders are often mentioned by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town is as a ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have a eye on which it fits, "if new buildings are approved, emphasizes the differentiating city building master.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the Stadtbaumeister contributes high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is builder, "at the end everything runs through my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">In case of support and coordination, it can count on long-term staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with Manfred Schöner (Lowest) for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also, his successor is long, Wacker is desiring: "we look for someone who wants to look really and remain."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Because of continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the other design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Who wants to quit Roland Wacker should have completed his studies as a Graduate Engineer and Bachelor of Technical University as a Graduate Engineer and completing good knowledge in the fields of building and construction planning.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The city council offers high- and low-construction, construction planning, tomundergrowth opportunities, municipal property management with building yard and municipal authority, including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Cycling on pipes: southern track imprisoned</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to police, those previously unknown cults had the blue bike from the railway gliding in the area of the Leobener Road (B116) onto the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">They were so badly damaged that the ringing goods had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigator come from two male valleys and are looking for the night hours after them.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the crime, witnesses were a rosary rolling and a bicycle driver had been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a limption," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA.</seg>
<seg id="2571">The or the perpetrators could have brought itself in great danger and also endangered the train traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">Next to the engine of the engine and the complex, as well as the delay and costs for rail revenues, other railway customers could also be added to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Overall, the spokesman said from a "significant" sum.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damage were refixed on Friday afternoon, rail traffic on the south route was carried out without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Barely ten personnel hoists about Friday morning were unusual, two of which are talking about correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight lifts were not falling from, but they were belated.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB speaker, Christoph Posch had to be exchanged around 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients may relieve patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The unhealed state, affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom, affects stomach cramps and blouses, recurring or blood circulation, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those concerned, meat and dairy products are usually guiding to relieve their symptoms, researchers found the amino acid tryptophan of proteins, who promote immune cells, who promote a tolerant Darm.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The Executive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the intestinal patrol, to ensure that the harmful microbes hidden in the food, not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are unable to resolve inflammations, protect the tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far south towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments we found that a type of tolerance conveying immune cells occurs in mice, which bear a particular bacterium in their feed.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to dissolve the values of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus cereteri - which is a normal portion of the gut microbids and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice were in their food, the more they had by these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an outtryptophan diet tolerant, less inflamed bowel milieus promotes if the same system is confusing at humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan encouraged a kind of immune cell who found tolerance when it was found that a group of study bats had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe that had been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It thought that the difference was to do with the Darmmikrobiomen of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The fermentation of mice were found in DNA and were found six bacterial species, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but lacking them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that a Darmmikrobiome was lacking and they did not develop the type of immune cells, and they did they did the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria overtook the immune system, the researchers observed L. reuteri in a fluid, and outlined small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerate cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved itself as a side product of the tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent, but when tryptophanise were cut, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that men have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us defend L. reuteri in our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if tryptophan-outproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in mice such as mice, but defects in genes have been found in relation to tryptophan.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells shall alter inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophanvalues can be found in the presence of L. reuteri to a expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2606">The 40 million pound signature from Chelsea began with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last preseason game, before the UEFA Cup match against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressive in the holder roll, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira will be prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2607">However, Matic had been excluded from the Pre-Asia tour of the blues and he managed only 45 minutes to lead to Mourinho, that he had to improve the Premier League season before beginning of the Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks, he thinks," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"we will help him be ready earlier than later."</seg>

<seg id="2622">New draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD-boss, opted social democratic presidents always at a certain sorrow to Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Just no storfires from the party set, only a headwind from the covenant - so the most important wish of the constants.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz the party has profoundly profoundly altered.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then the employee is watching the Willy-Brandt-house with increasing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz had been from there since the beginning of the year, is not described in the approach with headwinds.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were drunk.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after another.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal Republic of Lower Saxony has a general signal against the SPD and the Greens in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this one shows once again: red-Green cannot be restrained," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber the editor network Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprisingly fractionist of a Greens MEPs has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months prior to the Kurdish station, his red-green coalition has thus lost their one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Greens German businessman Michael Kellner has asked the wicked-Saxon Greens Elke Twest to repay her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transfer to CDU means a clear forgery of the voters.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Twest must immediately return to her mandate, "said the German businessman and campaign organisation of Greens Germany's German editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"that must not be true all," she sighed a SPD suffrage than Friday morning, the new Hiobsbotch reached the party centres.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the resignation of the green puties Elke Txt into the CDU without their own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional highlight of a full range of large and small crises in the SPD-country.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The mission began with the unexpecting defeat during the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more not, calmed down the comrades at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">It was then too - and everything was worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In Kiel, the SPD in Kiel produced the Tauel, the Düsseldorf-Pleite sculpted the party smooth.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades appeared again in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had made new courage, the G-20 Summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next deep.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Land steamer, lost his Nimbus, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie during his city.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because it is so pretty wrong in the crisis communication, what to make wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then Scholz is fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now even Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Due to the VW-emission and its role in the supervisory board, the Dutch Prime Minister stood in the criticism for longer in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese umption values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Still, or perhaps straight, Weil tried to get stronger in the covenant of accents in the last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The top of the former mayor of Hanover, expanding its power in Berlin, did not hide from Martin Schulz as well.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They left him, as they promised by Weil a stabilization of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">In the case Weil meets the party confiner, the lowSaxon Greens basically gets no guilt.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz did not work at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">The comrades therefore endeavour to hold their own ranks.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Her wrath is aimed at the Green, and here especially to the revolting parliamentarment in the West.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and corporate revealing how Mrs. Tvail provides her own karrierase about the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the party in the SPD-Bundestag, the editor network Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Mrs. Tlifejacket has not been elected for its person as a direct rule, but on the State list of the Greenery Greens in parliament, so the Lower Saxony-member states further.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thomas Oppermann, leader of the SPD parliamentary group, "Indicted a" undemocratic maneuver. "</seg>

<seg id="2670">I want to know if more has been more or an ongoing addition of the CDU Niedersachsen has been given.</seg>
<seg id="2671">Funding of local distributors III</seg>
<seg id="2672">Those who want to restore the house in the years, will soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">This informal mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development began on Wednesday in Empfingen.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a look back to the events so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been resting in Empfingen.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the reconstruction area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg have yet acquired two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the hitherto renovations are a "success project" - it is ultimately important to encourage the internal development and not just new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Government of the Karlsruhe, that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The amount amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros are from the country, the remainder of the municipality of Empfingen.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a sanitising area now arises?</seg>
<seg id="2682">You will continue to investigate Schindler, where the "houses are really old" houses.</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it does also play a role either in the planned area of all interest existing.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If applicable, the prayer festival could then shift again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The STEC represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Cellars presented the contents of the Federation-countries "Social City," where the renovations would then be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the vitalisation of inconstructions, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be referred to object, which means per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would then finally be determined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for the funding period has been running until April 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, only once the inventory was carried out, in the framework of those involved in the reconstruction surface involved a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, if possible the propositional order is to be performed, thus can begin with the renovations in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then stated that each Commune did carry out the defendant investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about to assess the urban allegences and decide how to determine when and in which scope.</seg>
<seg id="2695">It will then be registered for a plot of land in the basic book.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come again to Empfingen and got a picture of the situation, she spoke.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gottzel emphasized, an essential strategic factor for the project was the participation of the involved.</seg>

<seg id="2907">However, unlike many other acclications, many of the victims received the general humanity by retired and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories will be linked with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann also explains why the final report on the Scandal caused by Georg Ratzinger's descendants of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report about the "occurrence of violence in case of violation of the" Regensburger Domspatzen, "gives a contradictory picture of the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">One of these pupils dispense his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">To the other, he also appears as cholesterol and perfectionist, which was handled by the public, when a cathedral is musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you look as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and reads the entire 440 pages long from the front to the back, one must inform yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger appears at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just 8 sides dedicated to him and he is clearly directed by any suspicion of Mittens or cooperation in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence of violence at the preschool took place outside of his active sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It can be used too late if experiencing or first hints not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, in which he worked, was received by practically all the respondents - "redemption", "sky" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">As well as the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also presents it as "warm", "" "" "" "" expert, "" competent "and" understandable teacher, who supplied the guys regularly with cakes, cookies and sweets, and "always surrounded by grapes from kids."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about his PERFECTIONISM and his high Emotional, who also led to Wutausses.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw with the chairs and cast it on the ground, but also Earrings and allotted boys on the hair or ears, he has promised herself to proclaim and excuse itself.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honour must be said that such education methods in the fragile time, in the 1960s and 1970s, were in parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such as breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Naturally, I think each of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a gymnasium school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually written in this report, namely the adventable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the primary school, they are dreadful Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">When you're asking oneself if it is not more to do with his disability and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">The bavarian pope, many who have never understood him, still zealously.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report written by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report was reported a lot on the subject of abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also gained some involvement in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk with my father or mother," said a man concerned about the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the lightenment of sexual abuse has been and is, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, certainly not a chorus master who would have been a colleague who would have been a cheer.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the scratching student at Ratzinger's role in case of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned disciple did so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he had previously decided (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been able to maintain their perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd, assume that it is calculated as well... Bubbles intrusive or more also to have opened, than with their parents, interact instructors, confidentiality etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - and vulnerable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report comes to the very clear result: "affecting him in the field of concerned, and / or their environment, could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">So what sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free of every cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be rejected, nor may he be prevented, or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring its good name with this controversial crime as it was in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "non-violence should be read at the" Regensburger Domspatzen. "</seg>
<seg id="2946">The previous Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is described in the "wayward report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem in the coverage it was mixed and mixed to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence, somewhere in the middle of the Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there will be clean: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as we say, other predices.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the incidents have been occurring since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger won't have choir director of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the awful specimetry, the cases where the boys of sadistan teachers were sheltered and dreaming, at the primary school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really skandalous states have to have dominion.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those domination of Georg Ratzinger won't do anything, for he only got the boys in his face when they were already at the farmer's Hymn.</seg>
<seg id="2954">That was, like most of the witnesses, the theme of "Vorschule" at taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">You were just happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly places.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the ymnasium Domotengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was no discipline, but no seasonal violence prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2959">Not at the moment, at most, the veil stays skimmed away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was only serviced by two periods in which he was reported by the states of the primary school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself, and started by the previous generations of a school, which he didn't work and was responsible for it, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did George Ratzinger graduated in front of the states of consistent the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium who was even reproduced in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this way, he points to prove that the test is still practised in the primary school. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the risk of negative press releases he was urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity, as an investigator were banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before joining them in a legal grey zone, like everyone else I know.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to take care of the people who were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where the admissible border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he would always look away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">In 1980, the tests were officially abolished at schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to present the present day standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "fall of Anachronism," so the danger that took home to a moral measure.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is, of course, not for sexual abuse, which was desirable at all time, and also not for what is broken into the preschool and violence in innocent children's shrimps, which goes beyond the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">All this is quite dreadful and I am glad that it's finally dealt.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take George Ratzinger in protection, for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of discipline and punishment, then earrings and ears, they were widely distributed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was banned then he has also been strictly forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which image of his rainyburger, Georg Ratzinger took us back in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of Prüfer to be spoken also by language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI said from his perspective, playing the cathedral does not play a minor part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I believe that he conducted a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also that has to be said once: without these PERFECTIONISM, without any unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly be possible, from which until then a nationally known umbrella in Europe and his musical tradition that went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone, one does not make a big singer and before every success, right in which area, yet still discipline, passion and self-windings.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger on their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and in addition I've met Georg Ratzinger and always met again as wonderful, humorous and hearty people, of which you can not imagine that he could not only do a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'm still trying to get in touch with him as many former domination, today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly in contact him - he is almost blind - and he's almost blind - and they treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today he was strictly speaking to them, thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domain are grateful to him today, that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always a good, vaternal teacher - a hard father that may be - but still a lovable respect to which they are still looking for and the right to admired them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly said: all what you proposes to him are education methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long-overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unfair, one man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make media sinebuck.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil purpose which stands behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just published, was relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now it would be a 93-year-old man who possessed a 93-year-old man who would probably know great merits without leaving outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably nobody would have to let peace in peace.</seg>
