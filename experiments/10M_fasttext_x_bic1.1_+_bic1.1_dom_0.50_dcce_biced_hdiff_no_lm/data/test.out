Gol@@ fer Lang@@ er gets the sports pyramid
his experience on the horse are visible .
in the end of a golf club in South Africa Bernhard Lang@@ er sought a bit more variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Sp@@ her@@ es &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes the horses remember their celebr@@ ations , they pursu@@ ed in the quick g@@ pp at home to the fe@@ eds .
one kilomet@@ re at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament sie@@ ge - near horses .
he made himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t swim too short .
a long time this was the first time in Aachen , with the CHI@@ O .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen within a small Gala .
it does not lack@@ ing any awards to the like@@ able athl@@ ete .
Federal Police cross , Silver Chapel bay , Champions Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already tra@@ iled him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this distinc@@ tion does not mean a lot , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
since decades , Lang@@ er has been funding the offspring .
and so he also gave the money money of 25.000 Euro .
with 15 more outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ day US master class was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the award @-@ winning , the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmitt , who gave Cornelia G@@ ien@@ ger , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmitt , the Mo@@ ist Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , der Spr@@ inger@@ iter Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the study Erhard mir@@ ably .
many of these sports cars were at Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ative Society wander@@ ed to the Spring@@ field where the azza of Lav@@ atory .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and avoid the TT@@ P trade agreement - they want both Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US pre@@ sidential efforts are to decide on fiscal and energy policy as well as in principle .
the sub@@ mission in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a general , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep rather small in doubt as to harm the state of the economy , with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to help to death and regul@@ ate the economy and regul@@ ate his death .
but it would be quite different , claim@@ ing Tr@@ ump .
he will take stronger re@@ gu@@ ises , and he is working for a wide control reform with lower controls - for private people and for enterprises .
in contrast , in contrast : the state has agreed to ful@@ fil a lot of tasks to open himself and requires money .
thus taxes were increased to rich calls , says it .
both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the m@@ ute you will say , Tr@@ ump and Clinton become almost all equal .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly denied by the government @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wings of the Republi@@ can .
thus , party @-@ internal discussion could be added to Tr@@ ump .
the differences in the energy and climate policy are significant .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and coal the coal industry in the USA .
oil extraction should also be possible in so protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement .
in contrast , in contrast with their investment programme , Clinton int@@ ends to expand the renewable energies and demands : &quot; one country will create the super power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
however , not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two compet@@ itors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ az@@ if@@ ic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
both they want to isol@@ ate from international trade at the same time - but simply saf@@ egu@@ ard American jobs .
they should be better paid even if Clinton is required .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
as for a ump in this question , it is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be down , then he says he can not be changed .
however , the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep him before , the budget defic@@ it would only get bigger .
in the other hand , Clinton is on the other hand , asking her to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every whis@@ per@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who would flee by almost everyday life .
if arriving in Germany they often are trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women are sitting .
each one has a baby , which is a maximum one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he was curious in the space with big eyes .
his mother ris@@ er to the table top .
until they noticed that she is watching .
she sm@@ iles just short and k@@ iss@@ es the little ones .
the scene looks normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the division of business director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief staff in Bavaria , and also engaged in amongst others with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are fle@@ d@@ ged .
they live in the Munich north of one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accomodation and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs appointed up the furniture together with Pro Famil@@ ia and Munich &apos;s aid help .
it has been officially opened officially .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no - not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man from the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are persec@@ uted , because torture or death , or lack their families , she tells her as a symbol of hope to Europe . &quot;
for women we@@ igh other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly , because they see no other way . &quot;
in her hom@@ eland , they have experience with sexual violence , for@@ c@@ ting hon@@ ours , s@@ la@@ very , or forced pro@@ stit@@ ution .
this drives it away .
this will continue on the run .
&quot; a tu@@ g for an bottle of water for a bottle of water is asking for sexual action is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that , once they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re is told .
even here women would often be regarded as in@@ fer@@ ior and worst in refugees too .
this leads to about 90 percent of women who dwell in the property in the Munich north , trau@@ mat@@ ised , it is appreci@@ ated .
&quot; some of the children are not volun@@ tar@@ ily emerged . &quot;
many women have been so familiar that they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t trust to speak open@@ ly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they often do not need to help , I need more accommodation for them , called B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether they are w@@ aging from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction .
there is such a thing in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are not something in the governments of the governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ians are not isolated on women , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are two common floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
the European Parliament Committee on women &apos;s rights and gender equality also demands that women must be accommod@@ ated separately by men .
in a study which was published for the Committee , it is : &quot; it &apos;s very important that men and women are dis@@ pers@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there is no privacy or being accommod@@ ated by men and women , it may lead to ongoing - violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower rooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel this kind need , you can read the And@@ rang , which gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; since someone told us there we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
one could easily build a second house .
Assist@@ ants to : financial commit@@ ments due to new workers
Re@@ present@@ atives of the assist@@ ants have called for their union to appro@@ ve new emplo@@ yers with their disp@@ utes concerning a new agreement .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has asked its entire Council , appro@@ ve its emplo@@ yers from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have missed minister to address the wor@@ ries about the contract .
in July , assist@@ ants and medi@@ ators have agreed upon the re@@ jection of a contract which was agreed with BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained silent about problems that was rejected by the contract .
she said , &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board voted to re@@ ject the proposed new contract and re@@ ject an official re@@ voc@@ ation for all your wor@@ ries . &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today has set a formal application for a special meeting of BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a continuous program of es@@ cal@@ ating workers , beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes led that an intern investig@@ ates this year to sixth , the first overall waste in the history of N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A assist@@ ants Dr Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election of the agreed Ter@@ ms , which were advised by the BM@@ A , following the re@@ jection of the agreed contrac@@ tual conditions .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were held before the vote by 54@@ .000 Assist@@ anc@@ ies and Medi@@ zi@@ inst@@ ud@@ aments , with that the contract should be advant@@ age@@ ous and accepted .
according to the vote , the Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt says that the Doc@@ tors for Doc@@ tors in England would be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and to announce an official end of the eight months of the words of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin has g@@ otten his Turkish equivalent in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot dis@@ honor this reconc@@ ili@@ ation that Ankara doesn &apos;t want this reconc@@ ili@@ ation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin sm@@ iles the sm@@ iles , and he radi@@ ated just heat , even for its re@@ stra@@ ined conditions .
and Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an said , &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
he also said that relations with Russia will not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
on the following day , a paper descri@@ bing that Erd@@ og@@ an would have had such a thing that would never happen .
it seemed to me his enthusi@@ asm rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the crisis of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his initi@@ ation : the launch of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ terly burned .
Putin both ass@@ essed and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back .
the failure was even bigger , because it was committed by a des@@ ir@@ able friend .
building the Vet@@ r@@ auen again will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
state controlled media made a dev@@ ast@@ ating , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time , it seemed to wear the Turks for all the gu@@ ilt .
most serious , the acc@@ us@@ ations of conduc@@ ting civil servants that Erd@@ og@@ an had benef@@ ited from illegal oil tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king in the areas of Syri@@ ans that are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic state .
he disp@@ uted this .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting was only taking place because Putin has received the Erd@@ og@@ an President , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an requires first all of our friends , which he can get , after he was unve@@ iled last month at a trained coup d &quot; é@@ tat that last month .
repeated ter@@ ror attacks on Turkey , they have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic mot@@ ives .
Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is reduced by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agencies and Charter should be facil@@ it@@ ated if the flights are res@@ umed .
they count on a late seas@@ onal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week , the national television tr@@ acked fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish imports are imported again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , since its reaction to the tried protection of power was considered the weak response .
the pro@@ long@@ ed Gro@@ ll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ p@@ out on it is to draw from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , the Russian state of state won a bonus to ensure that after the tried coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , he ordered support for the chosen state organs .
that is well @-@ known for Moscow , self @-@ understanding , which itself has a deep @-@ sitting fear of reg@@ im@@ plant .
the summit in this glor@@ ious palace in the sea made it by Russia and Turkey , as described by myself an analy@@ st once described , &quot; alliance of foreign distribut@@ ors &quot; : two countries which pit@@ ched from the West and had aff@@ lic@@ ted bad@@ ly in the West .
nevertheless , despite the public reconc@@ ili@@ ation , between the two still large differences .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace maker , but where Russia and Turkey has counter@@ act op@@ posing sides .
it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first pre@@ domin@@ ating both President on the press conference , they had not even el@@ abor@@ ated the topic .
the President of Turkey mis@@ ed it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us on it , where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the Pot@@ en@@ zi@@ als for a perfect dis@@ aster than the NATO member of Russia - it certainly is better that the two heads of state must speak at least again each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the manager of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a Back@@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available outside the mainland Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was linked to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself as they had to be almost collap@@ sed in eight years ago .
in this time brand sk@@ ate@@ ers &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end consumers .
it supported international sports with millions of pounds of Spon@@ sor@@ ship , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to get more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , head office and stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for private clients who will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during the sight @-@ tour of our customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be dedicated to our invest@@ or brand , as well as the brand that our employees will be busy as we are now going to be a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank was home to a global brand , R@@ BS has been on the global brand .
I am saying that we are not able to pursu@@ e global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own con@@ greg@@ ations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be his Six Nations spon@@ sor@@ ing that will enhance the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in his sports @-@ spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical before three years ago when we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had this stamps .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , think I will see many changes .
we can l@@ anc@@ ake this stamps , so I think that the time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori takes the Je@@ bel to get the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ ited career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger , 4.@@ 493 Kar@@ ri@@ er@@ es@@ ie@@ ge
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the Modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , only few before him reached .
he has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct who distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control room .
he &apos;s a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusi@@ asm and char@@ is@@ ma enthusi@@ astic fans for years for this sport .
a few weeks ago , I said Frank@@ ie in Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already scored 6,000 profits , if it would not only be a weekly and large tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has been rid@@ den in GB almost 30 years , what great is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a brit@@ ish race , but beyond that he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying D@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat race for two decades .

a whole series of large tournaments , including its famous &quot; Gl@@ or@@ rich Sie@@ ben &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an air@@ plane crash and obtained a drug .
three years ago he had at first trouble when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive representation of returning his branch .
and he said not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said he has said that he wants to continue working for at least 50.@@ 9 years of life in competitions .
Russian President fi@@ res Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin is a@@ waiting the Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of Putin &apos;s state treas@@ ury .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the special representative for environmental and transport conditions .
in a position of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is without reason that Putin called Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s dis@@ mis@@ sal of his duties as the chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidential management . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been the country of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he graduated from the International Relations Director of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
upon the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later was prot@@ oc@@ oll@@ ing and head of the leader .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as state of state b@@ ills and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivan@@ ov asked that Ivan@@ ov has asked to leave his post and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
con@@ vince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this stage has made Moscow mysterious up@@ stairs .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet secret services , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both of them alle@@ ged that pole v@@ ault de@@ votes to their own request .
but in spite of the dis@@ connection for the cameras , there are only few of them convinced - especially before the parliamentary elections .
here is the ep@@ isode of an art struggle for combat ?
nobody knows that .
but the official claim - that a man who once was as a potenti@@ ally im@@ pot@@ ent president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - ste@@ adily forward to major ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism .
in his comments on Putin that are quot@@ ed on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov , &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you to put this very complicated Po@@ sten - one might almost say - compl@@ ain@@ able for four years .
how it turns out , I &apos;ve been chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidential management for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov participated in the post office in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin @-@ former Member of the State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Ministry of Research ( FSB ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he tru@@ sted at most .
once , Ivan@@ ov came to Putin &apos;s second term of office in Russia , since a third term of Putin might re@@ ject the Const@@ itution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies Put@@ in , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became President of three and a half years later .
British Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired , after he hit the producer
Gibson was involved in a physical con@@ front@@ ation set on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .

Que@@ ens@@ burger Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to loop
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion budget is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ burger Cross@@ over with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to loop .
it is the first of four gates of &quot; deck section &quot; which appro@@ aches every one of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of maturity is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tra@@ itors .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion budget is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Finance Minister Keith Brown held a visit to the site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbo@@ lic moment for building the que@@ ens@@ burger Cross@@ ings .
we are all the witness of a ver@@ ily art of ver@@ ily ep@@ ic in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of a bridge between the river Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity aimed to require precision toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the bridge deck is in their place and the last section of the deck is in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet for the deck , which means that the whole Deck is ready for the bridge to be lifted to his place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors &quot; said : &quot; the first closure pos@@ es a considerable achievement at any bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of the setting @-@ looking high and deep fashion is represented .
following the installation of the last road section and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pul@@ ling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long and an inc@@ line of about 3 % should be pulled upwards .
delicate , as the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny - on each side they were just some milli@@ metres .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , everything went very well .
res@@ cu@@ ing in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have good luck to be in life &quot;
three men still have to be alive . &quot; after they were thrown by a fishing boat , at An@@ gles@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station camp@@ ed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ St , after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security while their boat would move forward to their own power .
&quot; we saw the boat , like the boat , turned around and set us the worst thing , &quot; said the ladder of the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones &apos;s rescue station .
&quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds have already spar@@ ked the boat out of their reach until we left on water , &quot; added he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a bu@@ ke without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived abo@@ ard the coastal area and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station
Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men who were cast into the water , have happiness to be in@@ ju@@ red and still alive .
while the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , the boat stopped by the Bo@@ ots of the person , which ste@@ pped the boat .
someone acted today about these men .
seriously in@@ ju@@ red - man m@@ ates his ex @-@ friend .
a man attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and hard to hurt .
as the police took yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to get his personal things to get .
instead of the soft pet@@ rat@@ ors the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend instead .
when this came into the apartment , he appeared twice on them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ ju@@ red at his hand and on the body .
the police could take the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ ed consequence of his sister .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old has to calm her brother together with her partner .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her life .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life risk of man .
when the two women re@@ bet@@ ray the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old st@@ ub@@ born his sister to his side and grab@@ bed his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds Braunschwe@@ ig@@ s favorable apartments ?
the SPD and Green by my : investors also shall be much stronger in the duty of duty .
how will you react to bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 affordable housing in the coming years ?
the SPD propos@@ es a &quot; action concept &quot; to next reti@@ rement session .
but fight is programmed .
first line is the question : who should actually build the favorable homes ?
a regulation is missing so far .
SPD parliamentary candidate Christoph Viola : &quot; we are to build us with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build up 20 percent of all apartments than social apartments in the future . &quot;
the favorable properties can also be developed in the subject .
the big co@@ alition in the town hall was , however , so fr@@ ying : &quot; how do people want to build investors on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors at least 10 percent , but as if possible 20 percent of dwell@@ ings as a social circuit . &quot;
a new urban residential building programme , which is expected to cost millions and is to be financed , is supposed to be financed by inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , so fr@@ ying : &quot; there is still no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors a few rules as possible .
the left does not want gro@@ om for investors .
regardless of its , fr@@ ying , the flag has a deep@@ ening of the situation on the housing market .
will implemented the concept design , which will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear if we will get the skilled personnel .
however , the program is not entirely different : because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of other 1300 favour@@ able apartments that support over the next few years ?
there will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
to prevent this , the planning of schedule at Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city now .
in addition , it would have to be thought about to get their homes back in price .
this is possible in the western city .
on a blow , solve the problem .
because in the western city there are coming to the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments , one could get back in the price list for low apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , housing companies .
because the number of social apartments in the western town is dra@@ st@@ ically increased , one gets to the so @-@ called mix .
a concentration of social fe@@ at in just a few city parts should not give it more .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will be more movement in the discussion .
new President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke has means : &quot; for a wide majority the CD@@ U must move to the ship . &quot;
this is focused on more construction sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a com@@ promise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a ch@@ asing after health and luck that is worth@@ while
it &apos;s int@@ rig@@ u@@ ing to see how the world changes .
that teen@@ ager and child are not going to play outside , but rather we prefer to spend their free time to rigid on screens in the last decade of many .
at Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go things are about to get people of the sofa and become active .
the time on the screen was at the beginning of the TV , then limited to video games and recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
of course , I am based on the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters , initially produced for the video games in the 1990s ( later resulting from a cartoon animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
like many phen@@ om@@ ena of pop@@ culture the interest in the release of the game appeared in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed through massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players k@@ icked out with their smartphone inside and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tr@@ acked with a GPS as soon as they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , he joined the W@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the looking of the sofa .
in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that had covered the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who pursu@@ ed 35@@ ,000 users recently , announced that the number of people pursu@@ ed after two days after the introduction of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the resources for performance .
many public clearing campa@@ igns of health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to come , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active for 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; everyday &apos;s ears , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the meaning of sport can not be reviewed .
who regularly plays sports , reduces his chances to print on cancer or de@@ pression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to carry them here .
but the wonderful to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that people brings people to do something outdoors that fun .
these columns are covered by health - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people agree on the hunt even new friends .
as always , there are also maj@@ estic games that must always compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
it has lost a break@@ through .
even if smart apps like Fit@@ bit already could pursu@@ e our activity , they gave us no reason to play sports , as it does this game .
the new will lose its justice and the use will be after time .
but due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world will become one and helping many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ k on Thursday depic@@ ts the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under spot@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American woman Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ ns on the tail bar during the single multi @-@ campaign for women during the summer season at Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a sur@@ f@@ ting victory and a total of the fifth while they have established their reputation , the best of their generation or even being at all .
she broke out in tears , when their final score was shown and their long journey was found at that moment .
this success is in the same le@@ ague like unique athletes such as Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps who brought about their sports to new high@@ s :
Bil@@ it dominated the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that contain a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that the Olympic winner of 1984 Mary Lou rescue is said that she is the best gymn@@ ast that I ever saw . &quot;
it expected an final ex@@ am in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather cle@@ ans@@ ed between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as a dis@@ appointment .

this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man capit@@ ol , called by the American &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , had an advantage .
upon her floor , she cast the audience to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eb@@ ack , which sometimes had du@@ bi@@ ous .
as far as it affects , the wid@@ est twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ case when listening to music in the car
according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who have killed in one of the most k@@ ill@@ ful attacks in Phoenix during a decade as they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah , shot while the car was par@@ ked on 12 June , said the authorities .
the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ory eight shots from a hand @-@ car@@ af@@ e weapon , while he got on the passenger side of the car and then fled by another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police shared that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a boot@@ legs , since the att@@ ack@@ ers did not sett@@ le the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that took part of an adult victims .
the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told that the shooting started to become a nearby view if they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , pre@@ domin@@ antly in H@@ isp@@ an@@ ic residential areas were killed in nine attacks seven people and two were in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; it occurs in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; announced Howard R@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown sp@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black b@@ m@@ w from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked from the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alised because of her in@@ jur@@ ies .
Liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness was told by the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ able car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was target@@ ed on an empty Pickup @-@ Truck a half hour before the triple murder , it was prec@@ eded by the work of the mass mur@@ ders .
the agent found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ ce@@ ph@@ alia : &quot; it is getting better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old love Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and naturally her mother .
but like the least of his age , Edmund Mikro@@ ze@@ ph@@ alia , the result of a genetic disorder which did not know about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto .
when he came home the first time , my first idea , I did not create it .
I did not create this .
at that I didn &apos;t let me down .
whatever is wrong - of course , it has settled on it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund she could never recognize her in the conditions , and he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they struck him inst@@ itutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still wanted to make &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto .
Edmund can run with help from a help .
Edmund Optics was sitting up until his third year of life neither sitting nor again he can &apos;t speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
he can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language which Edmund Has@@ h has chosen me a little bit before . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;ll bring him drawing language at &quot; , Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical char@@ ity -- it says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
Mikro@@ ze@@ ph@@ alia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund , and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forec@@ asts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to affect the life of those associated with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I always asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I have been asked for a long time no longer after the pro@@ gn@@ osis , because I &apos;m not waiting for someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has an ho@@ p@@ ent advice for moth@@ ers of babies with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is getting better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

fier@@ y ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ area flo@@ ods in Louis@@ iana forced the Govern@@ ors on Friday to break the emergency . it will be counted throughout Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the Sou@@ theast Sou@@ theast Sou@@ theast and south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded its banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding in extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , the National weather Service .
on the way , the Govern@@ or of Louis@@ iana John Bel Ed@@ wards announced that state offici@@ als have been in constant contact with the local Author@@ ities and the help of the communities already on the way .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emerg@@ ency Prepar@@ ed@@ ness of the Govern@@ or , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the village of Tang@@ ip@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ ding system is used across large parts in the south Louis@@ i@@ pine@@ apple up to Saturday .
the weather service had failed that an additional 3 @-@ 5 inches could be able to rain from rain .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas on Friday , a fleet test system was employed when it continued in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite close to B@@ aton R@@ oug@@ es and the river Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , are reaching a record level of all lik@@ el@@ i@@ hood after the weekend .
the cycl@@ ist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flo@@ ods many houses in the subur@@ bs near B@@ aton Rouge .
he also said that a significant floo@@ ding in Ascen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , as they are going to flow through the beaten rivers only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the River Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 0@@ 9.00 .

Han@@ s@@ ford , 62 , says that water by Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from its house , grew strongly .
he said to him another st@@ ep@@ y who lives near , war@@ ned .
&quot; we are asc@@ ended and the waters flow@@ ed and in@@ treated , &quot; said Han@@ s@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife Han@@ s@@ ford said they in the 48 years of whom she lived there , never seen such a high level of the river .
Han@@ s@@ ford said that he and his family members would have had all the disabled , and he could swim .
Han@@ s@@ ford said Not@@ hel@@ fer could have saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought her to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were up to Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding was so fast , since there was still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , so the authorities ev@@ ac@@ uation ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .

&quot; the last great floo@@ ding that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Coun@@ rum from the city management .
this seems to be a similar inc@@ ident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager said Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys , that it continued at the Gulf Coast .
according to its statements , a hand@@ ful of houses have been reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but no reported on Friday until now .

the police cle@@ ared that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .

&quot; he has gone through a lot , his little body was penet@@ rated by balls , &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ en@@ dez on the transmitter .
I just cannot believe that .

the other two sacrif@@ ices were not found in the car and the police are determined , whether one of the last men could be the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors .

Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault rif@@ le , which were trac@@ ed to different assault rif@@ le , covered the facts .
it seems that it was clearly negoti@@ ating to a serious battle .
on the road , on both sides of the trail , Sle@@ eve took place .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I introduce myself to the &quot; Olympic Village in the Tur@@ ns &quot; and for more than one reason .
first@@ ly , I have been with every summer Olympics ever since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secon@@ dly , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez , who was inspired by many young girls from other skin color .
the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ woman and Mad@@ ison K@@ oc@@ ian , who is cath@@ o@@ lic@@ ated , is round every pro@@ ud@@ ly .
this team is reflected in the USA .
it has fixed the black and h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one amongst female tur@@ ner@@ ships was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this is strength .
on the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surpris@@ ingly Olympics and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful gymn@@ astic trains .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won the gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
man member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but you don &apos;t see tournaments in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie wrote all the same way as A@@ ly and Mad@@ ison to create it in the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics are only four gymn@@ asts of the team . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but reality looks like that Tur@@ ns become an expensive sport and Turner first place in private tournaments that will be sustain@@ ed by parents , who will continue for the training , furnis@@ hing , it@@ rust and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these tournaments lie in pro@@ sp@@ erous subur@@ bs which can support business .
in these clubs the Turner will receive their entire training and this is for families a more expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ n@@ an@@ dez , have both trained athletes since they started with the Tur@@ ns .
we need to insp@@ ire the municip@@ alities of Au@@ n inn@@ umer@@ able young girls who insp@@ ires by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , making a more powerful and easy access exercises .
I was founded by 20 years ago .
we have offered free and affordable tur@@ t@@ ins in Harlem for more than 15.000 urban y@@ outh@@ s ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my h@@ omet@@ own ) to offer young high @-@ quality Gymnast@@ ics that make the possibility to earn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination of the body as well as hard work , discipl@@ ine and determin@@ at@@ eness for the spirit .
this combination gives life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for education and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to interest for the tur@@ nes and this is great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Mad@@ ison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks so many young girls motiv@@ ated to get their way to start , healthy , strong and successful young women .
pract@@ iti@@ oner would like to organ@@ ise more strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers had ho@@ pes to end the disp@@ ute over the amend@@ ments caused by a re@@ formed contrac@@ tual agreement with the offici@@ als of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3,@@ 000,000 Assist@@ anc@@ ies who were elected to vote .
in July , hunt plans were unve@@ iled to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first Assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which has changes to night@@ - and weekends , to improve care of non @-@ ast@@ able movements .
DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ tees for assist@@ ants divided the last night in a notification by means of serious concerns , in particular , that there is a serious wor@@ sen@@ ing crisis , especially to treat the current con@@ currently being . &quot;
for only eight weeks , who remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress must be made ste@@ adily and the time runs out .
efforts from the BM@@ A to solve the disp@@ utes by con@@ vers@@ ations in the government on resistance to eng@@ age in and sometimes on the af@@ ening silence .
that was what Jerem@@ y Hunt did last month of thinking that his door would always open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now to lift the condition and speak the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he do not do this , so the intern failed , that they are ready to conduct further work events .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of almost 13@@ ,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , as n@@ urses and denti@@ sts were included to provide doctors on the strike post@@ mark .
the ministers had ho@@ ped down to end the conflict through an acceptance of the re@@ formed agreement with the offici@@ als of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better fin@@ ing re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the 54@@ .000 Registr@@ ar , which will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS , asked for assist@@ ing assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; work of work does not reach a little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families just worry , dist@@ ress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the past two months we spoke to the comp@@ elling of assist@@ ants , and with the Ministry of Health and other ministers positive about the concerns in terms of the gu@@ ardi@@ ans and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ job .
the employer ho@@ ped that the continued positive commitment on other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , education and the gender @-@ specific payment of education in medicine - such as serious it was the employer that had Health Education England and the heal@@ thcare regarding the compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro Tag@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack tr@@ is@@ iko
thousands of cardi@@ ac patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after the authorities recommended to admin@@ ister this more for a longer period of time .
the t@@ inn@@ ed medicine Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ction for people with a heart disease .

some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack and one quarter of these suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attack and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulating gre@@ asy materials in the ar@@ ter@@ ey walls to form the pads .
when the Bel@@ ag breaks down , it can cause a blood cl@@ ause which c@@ log@@ ged the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .

Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ ith and is reduced under the trade name Br@@ il@@ ique , reducing this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the NI@@ CE design study , which has been published today , recommends a 12 month in@@ gest@@ ion of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ gl@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE Health Analy@@ ology centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , or a stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ric consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ gl@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively reduce the reduction of other heart attacks and stroke in people who had already a heart attack .
with the provis@@ ional recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand the treatment options of thousands of people who can benefit .
the information on effic@@ acy and safety of Tic@@ in@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the guid@@ eline is no treatment that goes beyond this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness allows suff@@ rage to blo@@ om in Muslim areas
the former may@@ or of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government court for corruption in the office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to that far more widespread amount of Muslim communities are acc@@ ident@@ ally igno@@ red as a dev@@ ast@@ ating govern@@ ance report today .
the former cabin of Sir Eric P@@ ickl@@ es attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber on the evidence of election abuse due to &quot; Over @-@ sensitive about eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an anti @-@ cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion@@ sk@@ ull , said that the restri@@ ction of vot@@ ers from religious mot@@ if@@ s is so bad that it should be not allowed to protect de@@ bri@@ ers outside of const@@ itu@@ ency .
he recommends that vot@@ ers should pass a pass to prove their identity in order to prove their identity .
at the time a vot@@ er must call his name and address .
the report propos@@ es that not removable ink on the finger of one person to prevent her cho@@ ices to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should be more protection , says Sir Eric .
he ur@@ ges so that the press should have more access to community centers and decisions of non @-@ official compression or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets pol@@ ls in the east of London .
last year a special court decided that the current may@@ or Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man should be ut@@ tered after a lit@@ ig@@ u@@ ary to corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ tes .
the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ished the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cy@@ n@@ ical way , and he said that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islamic and Islamic stat@@ us@@ ations .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis for the religious duty of Muslims , to choose it . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the ep@@ isode of a reproduction , where one person has chosen others .
Sir Eric said that it would be in the whole land evidence for fr@@ aud .
in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent mail @-@ election - at the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people made to choose a candidate of choice .
Sir Eric , shown , made several recommendations to clean the election system including the Fü@@ hren of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof , it was appropriate to select that pressure on protective needs of some ethnic minority interests , especially women and young people , in order to choose between the will of the el@@ derly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ loon background .
&quot; there was concerns that ... state institutions such as such behaviour was igno@@ red by &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; sensitive about eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban , that political activ@@ ists edit documents to stop &quot; re@@ ap . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May in consider@@ ing , requires also t@@ oug@@ her registration checks to prevent the electoral roll is used for immig@@ ration and social fr@@ aud purposes .
options : consider , vot@@ ers before choosing to ask your identity .
not removable ink on the finger of one person , once they gave her voice to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
system@@ atic review about the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on mot@@ ions to a automatic mail @-@ selection .
prohib@@ ition that political activ@@ ists edit full post@@ ure and envelop@@ es by mail .
the police give the power to lock away cho@@ ices .
a law change , which facil@@ it@@ ated an indictment in accordance with the Re@@ presentation of the People Act 1983 ( Council Direc@@ tive Act 1983 ) .
photographer forb@@ ade in election stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the cho@@ ices ( with the exception of Wales ) .
inten@@ sif@@ ying the training , to ensure that the employees usually estimate that vot@@ ers alone go to the campaign .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolit@@ an Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets there is no criminal off@@ ence .
&quot; the election court has Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his Deputy Commander for a lit@@ igation against any lit@@ igation and illeg@@ ally explained , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty for a number of reasons due to the high demands of criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ control &quot; of the election dep@@ artments of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court sur@@ part in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country carries the Mother of Par@@ li@@ aments a proud he@@ ir , but the poss@@ ess@@ ing and conce@@ aled selection of suff@@ rage and reti@@ rement of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger by Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the Rio Olympics in Rio this week went over the French cycl@@ ist Pauline Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot aside from the edges and band that pays tribute to the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year old Olympic champion in this summer won &apos;t be the only one to give gold fighting Ath@@ l@@ ete which has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least no longer proves to give the social media belief .
at the honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all those famous faces , which have created for time on our screens , has created an lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics that show more than just a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity with Hollywood .
the fighter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
besides the Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , many people demonstrated on the Internet as a certain arch@@ bishop of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the arch@@ ery got the mad@@ ness of the social media , and gave him to hear that he looks for his childhood , he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see great simil@@ ar@@ ity , with the exception of the fac@@ ial ha@@ iry , &quot; Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a hand@@ some guy , so I hate that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular conditions since London 2012 will definitely focus on the focus : the ar@@ ming simil@@ ar@@ ity between the British pianist Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Ne@@ il Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her great , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African sw@@ immer Cameron van der Burg@@ h is compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption acting player
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice , who exhibits a similar way of eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ ulia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ brow@@ nish skin and light@@ ning hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cord , while American Nathan Adrian from fans was attacked , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star H@@ ope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenn@@ ifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy to have liked the simil@@ ar@@ ities too .
a theory is put into space : according to this user , it might be a reason for the simil@@ ar@@ ity of the Pa@@ ares .
a Twitter User@@ in explained her satis@@ faction , &quot; the rest of the Internet thin@@ ks that H@@ ope Solo and Jenn@@ ifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;

the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard at who made him many to talk at him .

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a bit saf@@ er .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed du@@ sts along the distance .
regardless of whether you approach from the front or back you will show you the video as you can flip the ske@@ wer .
if one can turn back from behind , you should be able to see yourself as a replacement so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers , and &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take a weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face him with your free el@@ bows .
beat him as a kne@@ e in the power and spin yourself while the att@@ ack@@ ers in front of pain k@@ icks , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into your face and move forward , while they turn the weapon to him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers that approach from front , the technique is similar - move your body from the Line of shooting , take the weapon and turn them out so that the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
just put the weight on the weapon simultaneously and beat the ass@@ ail@@ ant on the chest , then turn the weapon from his grip before moving back@@ wards and the weapon will move upon him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a volume of the saf@@ est one , your money is enough - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
Reis@@ er Ian Wright goes into the dirty places of Europe for a travel guide of his tongue .
a British trav@@ eller under@@ taken his immune system and dign@@ ity of severe testing , bringing some of the most dirty and most important places in Europe .
moder@@ ator and it@@ au@@ tor Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ ol@@ k took his course on a Euro @-@ like , a mar@@ gins at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button in Russia to proof the resistance to its immune system .
before turning of each object , he used a Lumin@@ aries to show up and show us what he is going on .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner ST@@ REN@@ G@@ TH &quot; brought some surprising results with daylight .
the thought , the jet@@ ting button of a toilet block was used , which already used by thousands of others , but actually you are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
in his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals say about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , nothing left what he was shot , more than a bad wre@@ ck in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of its bo@@ wel , by the world , and fun , as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations up to dish@@ washers from toilets , the task placed his immune system definitely under a sample
he told me in the movie : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ troubled what my health concerns and I have put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in film , he was just a righteous to his call .
the only thing he emp@@ tied , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ position was showed an increasing number of more than 4000 units .

but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to ref@@ use after their lumin@@ esc@@ ence over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands appear one out of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Val@@ io produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner ST@@ REN@@ G@@ TH , &quot; which shows the bacterial population in different locations like the bathroom .
in the film he says : &quot; that comes to the worst thing I have tu@@ cked in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing dirt more than that !
I will see nothing here , because it &apos;s in@@ scri@@ bed here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner ST@@ REN@@ G@@ TH &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Val@@ io .
the company is equ@@ ip Mr. Wright with Val@@ io Ge@@ fil@@ us , which includes both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to promote intest@@ inal bacter@@ ias and immune system .
Val@@ ios Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer ourselves something new to consumers .
something that is fascinating to look and explain the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics at the same time .
we held crazy lig@@ inst@@ orm@@ ings by allowing us to call &quot; L@@ ass &quot; Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is to be a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to make them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday life , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how they associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more informations on an interesting way .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , directed by the film , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have tast@@ ed my respect for Ian , if he would have tast@@ ed my respect for Ian , that I have instru@@ cted him , such as the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to get it and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad , that we have recorded some of these dirty jobs on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by the survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ d@@ ents of all respon@@ d@@ ents , especially with the well@@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said that they may use at least occas@@ ionally products that included lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ Social Family destro@@ ys the social camp in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their welfare unit after a delay in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had terror@@ ized their neighbo@@ urs .
Tan@@ ya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ vis@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
once they were removed from their estate , the employees of residential property were found in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls proved cl@@ adding holes on wooden beams , rub@@ b@@ ish was destroyed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated at the walls .
the family have been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed to be living in a private accommodation
DONNA Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management of Corn@@ wall Housing , said they don &apos;t have to fix the flat .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute space night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property probably considered as not as beautiful part of the Corn@@ walls are considered .
the family is not@@ ching and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police , having added that the ter@@ ror that the family had added , tr@@ ench@@ men with bas@@ eb@@ all , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , drug tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king and exc@@ essive writ@@ ings , strings and flu@@ ctu@@ ations .
Skel@@ eton , 47 , whose name was le@@ ased on the le@@ ase , got an order for ant@@ isolated behaviour in June .
in some areas of the house that under conditions will be torn down , cold gar@@ bage was found
there were in the property which tra@@ ded in the past of drugs , ri@@ pped the wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp
neighbo@@ urs told they that they saw her on the road and called regularly the police to inv@@ ade .
Corn@@ wall Housing ch@@ oked her and her partner this week viol@@ ently from the property after they gave them a pro@@ long@@ ed delay of 11 weeks to draw up volun@@ tar@@ ily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by the neigh@@ b@@ ors who said that their lives was made hell .
he said , &quot; They fell by no one . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the count@@ less times we can say the police are incredible .
&quot; we could not sleep today . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - that we are not used !
now , wher@@ ever they are gone , it &apos;s going to be nice .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had t@@ anned the family to cooper@@ ate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was sum@@ mon@@ ed in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the deli@@ ber@@ ate site of the congregation house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys was under@@ thrown .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it was ab@@ iding to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and to her family , as there is always a delay , the last step is taking into account of Corn@@ wall Housing .
it was a very difficult fall since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their de@@ eds to look terrible for their neighbo@@ urs .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the cop@@ s of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously appro@@ ached us and have left us the information .
I hope that this development is don@@ ed by some neigh@@ b@@ ors and commun@@ icated the message that ant@@ isolated behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
they said that all three sons have lived in the house at different times , but they all be over 20 .

in 2014 , the police managed a raid in the house and found over 70@@ G Cannabis as well as commod@@ ities , par@@ ap@@ her@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ eton was given a fine , after she pleaded guilty of the b@@ room of a Class B in terms of trade .
they claimed that the money for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who was killed in 2013 with a car accident .
after they have been without Ob@@ d@@ ach , Tan@@ ya and her partner is now living in a private resort to Plymouth .
many of the house walls were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that it will be ten@@ ant , not to keep those in the house .
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall divided that del@@ og@@ ging had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , not to keep the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can assume themselves without deduc@@ tions , as well as those who were damaged by such behaviour . &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shall never toler@@ ate criminal and int@@ act behavi@@ ors who continue to cooper@@ ate with partners to protect our churches .

Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ amt of a trem@@ end@@ ous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in tradition@@ ally conserv@@ ative states to obtain their majority .
pre@@ sidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weak@@ ness of his campaign to the publi@@ can strong@@ hold of Utah .
a rare moment , in which the normally sp@@ ur@@ ly and self @-@ conf@@ used mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns , reported as correspondence chess .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within their own re@@ publi@@ can camp , the doubt is growing up for his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; we have trem@@ end@@ ous problems in Utah , &quot; says Tr@@ ump from Evangelical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
wrong reports are false about his candi@@ d@@ acy , again he took his famous media shif@@ ted .
Republi@@ can High bur@@ sts m@@ ack@@ les
Utah is usually a safe bank for the re@@ publi@@ can .
a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ s from June , says Tr@@ ump and his recur@@ r@@ als from the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other instit@@ utes show Tr@@ ump ; however , not with the distance that are common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as end@@ ang@@ ered , Arizona and Georgia .
in an interview with the Sen@@ ator CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump wrote on the question as he wants to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons , &quot; just as I have done it so far . &quot;
and whether behind : this will be &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing else as &quot; decl@@ are the truth . &quot;
if it was not rich for him in the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness that it was ok , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party Tr@@ ump is threatened to under@@ line money to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better ob@@ serv@@ ations .
instead of the new Re@@ public@@ ans , candidates for Congress take stronger than arms .
Olympia : triple Sc@@ am at D@@ oping test
the I@@ OC wants to set up a discipl@@ ine commission in the case .
born after the second D@@ oping aff@@ air in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro , Kenya is threat@@ ening to the second D@@ oping aff@@ air .
following a fr@@ aud control in a D@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee dealt with , immediately one discipl@@ inary to study the case in order to investig@@ ate the case .
a ken@@ ian function@@ aries announced that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had a test sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre run@@ ner Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this has been reported to the team manager Ken@@ ias from the D@@ oping controls .
the World association IAAF has encour@@ aged the I@@ OC for information about the case to provide his own research , shared a IAAF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the I@@ OC , the IAAF World Championship will take an assessment , it was named in a IAAF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to D@@ oping control station and has released itself as a Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Red@@ ich , the sample published and signed , &quot; stated in Kenya &apos;s CEO de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was owned by the ac@@ cred@@ itation of athletes who stood on the list of training courses of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich has turned over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athletics Championships was sub@@ trac@@ ted by Michael Rot@@ ich from the Rio Olympics .
he should be informed of the bud@@ ding sport@@ s@@ men of his land on D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was supposed to be arrested by his return at Nairobi airport .
Kenya has already been under particular observation at I@@ OC after numerous d@@ oping attemp@@ ts .
with the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping @-@ objectives controlled by the Rio Games , most likely before the Rio Games were pointed out that Ath@@ l@@ etes are taken from Kenya and Russia .
in particular , the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency carried out a lot of pressure on African country , an anti @-@ D@@ oping law and a function@@ ing control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start .
as a consequence , the WA@@ DA is growing in the list of countries whose D@@ oping control con@@ forms with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as the great run@@ ner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country have won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV report the ARD were raised and raised that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport stack .
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und ordered a similar investigation in Kenya as he had put them in the Russian track .
it could be proven that in this sport art nation@@ wide and system@@ atically insulated .
Russian exp@@ atri@@ ots were thus excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger Land West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespe@@ are @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a trag@@ ic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli girl .
a Musical At@@ tor@@ ney Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director of Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the temple of the classic and filled with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra conducted by Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel conduc@@ tors conducted by Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say they are very sh@@ an American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in its tem@@ po and its mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ stein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she remin@@ ds himself with the mid@@ wives with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first@@ ly because they are mus@@ ically exceptional !
and then there would be Mar@@ ias personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is cle@@ ver , of course n@@ ai@@ v , and very passion@@ ate .
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very much , my Italian character I think as Roman gem , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor to work with you .
she is a dis@@ astro@@ us man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and passion@@ ate ! &quot;
conduc@@ ting is for him a need .
you see it in every of his movements , in his ga@@ ze , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a jo@@ y@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s very important !
the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly top@@ ical : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot;
today , we have taken the refugees at that time , the New York State , and the New York inhabitants , did not want it .
they are the same topics , and they are as mean@@ ing@@ ful as it was today .
59 years later , the piece still is relevant .

more Turks are used to asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ als .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the occup@@ ational existence .
&quot; he who does not fit and Erd@@ og@@ an is pra@@ ises , sits on packed sounds , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation , Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on figures from the German Ministry of Labour , the Turks were the biggest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the p@@ utsch .
to the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people , and with roughly 29 percent of all recognised as as@@ yl authorised ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey does not find themselves before war , poverty or hyp@@ ot@@ om@@ nia .
asylum interests after the Basic Law are polit@@ ically , therefore followed by state side .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it bur@@ ht@@ ut &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing from the summer election campaign , and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the country tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the legisl@@ ative elections will not return directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Sovereign Council already decided at the beginning of the year .
because as far as until now it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and ground combat struggle - that is b@@ iting .
the loc@@ als that are to be convinced by the vot@@ ers are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not a loc@@ als , so you cannot choose the country tag .
for this purpose , practical problems : in the holidays there are hel@@ pers to spread the posters , bal@@ lo@@ ons , flyer , and end up at the end of voices , only pi@@ ous .
until September 4th , 2016 , the electoral and last holiday destination , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over the people by far to the people .
the name , if one can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also some : Minister @-@ President Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U Co@@ alition , must fear office .
the SPD , since 1998 in the strongest party , lies in pol@@ ls clearly behind the CD@@ U .
it is exciting to cut as strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ r and left over the end of co@@ alition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 heads of government , making an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive election campaign .
he travels through land , distributed ros@@ es and spar@@ es a little with the people as well as his legendary wor@@ d@@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did .
otherwise char@@ ity got cold feet and Merkel sets the bl@@ ame in the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ d .
their refuge@@ e policy , its &quot; We create this &quot; have acceler@@ ated the as@@ cen@@ sion of sp@@ ell @-@ pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is expected to cost it up now .
the CD@@ U with its pointed primary data , the Interior Minister Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced , as it is when you make a wrong time at the right place of pol@@ ling .
she has been invited for secondary education at Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s b@@ oll@@ ard circle is located in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not agree that there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other German states , &quot; compl@@ ain@@ ted Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR .
but it also f@@ ade to listen to anyone from other rough edges of Germany , once Angela Merkel listen .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U ren@@ ounces mainly on the usual voting rights to market fields and pre @-@ bal@@ lo@@ ons with sun umbrel@@ las and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this means co@@ hes@@ ion , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union also noted that you are leaving the basis in the country so that it must be very strict , to get a wire to the people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , hardly available in the pon@@ ds of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U electoral fighting continues to be self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ely : &quot; you have to go there where it is revol@@ ving , namely wher@@ ever the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD in a particularly committed campaign combat .
in survey@@ s , Democrats strongly suggest 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ d ( 19 ) .
by the election of 2011 , the SPD recognized already with 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in pol@@ ls , must create the leap into the Parliament .
from the holidays , you have a modern virtu@@ e and lay down their election campaign for a large part of the internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; it is called by Claudia Müller &apos;s pre@@ sid@@ ents .
otherwise green suff@@ rage are available for trace gu@@ iding according to native voices among the tourists .
Silke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , kur@@ v@@ t even with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ eckl@@ en@@ burg@@ ischen lakes and finds it still beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants will suffer from blocking
at the speed of speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for the leaders of the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and ends only at 20 : 00 a.m. , there is always praise .
&quot; they have made everything pretty cr@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells about the jet fuel station .
this is a Super@@ team .
there is no re@@ treat .
building site was scheduled for half @-@ time plan to the south at the beginning of October , everything will be ready by the end of October .
this will also pay the function of responsibility for the construction of respon@@ si@@ bilities , if it comes to furnis@@ hing lights .
since the construction site moved in south on Monday and also the ob@@ struction of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was abol@@ ished and thereby , the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , has also relaxed in the place of the town .
citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the trip through the village seems to be back .
&quot; there was partly considerable complaints , &quot; said the vice @-@ related managing director Florian King responsible for the maintenance @-@ related management .
the residents of Bach@@ men@@ se , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ strasse , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many Schle@@ ich@@ trails tried and rather their Nav@@ i Trust as the signs .
for what led to some trucks in residential areas fran@@ ce .
because the speed limit were not log@@ ged , the assembly takes up the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there was considerable exc@@ it@@ ations , &quot; says King , who knows himself on site about the location .
two to three per minute were re@@ per@@ ved .
the fastest @-@ speed was in the pace @-@ 30 zone with 77 est@@ il@@ ath@@ il@@ omet@@ res .
since the construction site has passed , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business course at the B 27 it is only a small tro@@ phy that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , now the road is open again .
business people can &apos;t like to look at the cards .
but if the B 27 @-@ San@@ itation has led to sales in revenues , each one is asking you .
however , some more and some are affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; so for other companies , has hardly any consequences for the renovation .
also at the Auto@@ haus Maier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight decline , but also dre@@ amt of course , &quot; the course of course is missing . &quot;
the local along the road is floo@@ ded along the highway .
J. Albert G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds distinct words .
that is already existing threat@@ ening .
not just him but all hosts have made it hard . &quot;
customers were missing from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and R@@ ott@@ weil .
we have to be happy with each additional sales .
the net sales grew by far over 50 percent . &quot;
the road was back two years back . &quot;
he has to release half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differ@@ ently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt will give on a request by G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , whether there is a financial compensation , the restaurant benef@@ ited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages that caused by re@@ structuring .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows of other distri@@ cts , where it was so generous .
in all suits , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER will be sure that his restaurant will continue .
the family business has been located since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
therefore , other regul@@ ars are frequently pre@@ ju@@ red because of the complex traffic management , he can understand .
if one cannot drive , it is very different .
after the end of the re@@ habilitation work , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER has no doubt about it .
despite the crisis with BSE and avian fl@@ u G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER holds the effects of the B 27 construction work to its customers for the biggest crisis which has experienced its history in its long history .
six months of construction work is brutal .
continually , screwed on in the name of terror@@ ism against laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère now establ@@ ishes a thick security package .
but what did a map status with ter@@ ror to do ?
and what does the co@@ alition partner to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère gives the reconc@@ ili@@ ation .
all his proposals are polit@@ ically mostly &quot; political dialogue , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the Presentation of his new safety par@@ ak@@ ets .
you are not calling any@@ body .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in it too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère then drop a little time before his concl@@ usions for the security in the Republic .
but these are now more extensive .
much is known , announced , re@@ bo@@ red that a new security authority must take care of cr@@ ack communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security officers are also not surprising .
as part of the campaign , de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère takes a second start for proposals to date with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ y for terror@@ ists with double citi@@ zen@@ ship , and j@@ ih@@ ad@@ ist with double citi@@ zen@@ ship .
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U Mann cle@@ ared .
but he still main@@ tains this for mostly and demanded anything in what co@@ alition partner do not have chances .
a few new ideas please introduce de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère as well .
these are partially in itself : he plans quick action for de@@ port@@ ations and more options for det@@ ention of people from de@@ portation .
refugees who are target@@ ed target@@ ed to land should then reveal their smart phones and create social media accounts for a security examination .
at the case of att@@ empt@@ ing asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than ever - such as such , criminal off@@ ences or their papers concerned in order to deter@@ ior@@ ate their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and leg@@ ally dev@@ ast@@ ating .
Man@@ ches also works imp@@ lic@@ ate and leaves question open .
and with some points - in the in@@ equality of toler@@ ated for example - is the question : what does this really have to do with safety and ter@@ ror ?
Yes , says de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes of refugees and ter@@ ror .
but it cannot be addressed that the Att@@ ac@@ ters from Ans@@ bach and Würzburg have been dis@@ placed .
besides , many people in view of the high refuge@@ e figures are concerned about security .
and things that human beings were deeply involved in election times , even in election times .
the inner level of safety is trem@@ end@@ ous in the focus .
first of the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the pollution is great .
and yes , there are elections .
Union and SPD agree on internal safety , therefore increasingly in position .
in recent days there was between the two parties high .
only a small disp@@ ute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a certain security state @-@ collection of some Un@@ ions of the Interior , in which the dep@@ artments had called a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of double citi@@ zen@@ ship .
de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère need here to im@@ plac@@ able sounds .
he is nothing from a return from the double pass .
we will satisfy the discussion in Germany .
to get up , do not make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he was const@@ itutional objec@@ tions .
whether its own package is un@@ const@@ itutional and whether it is &quot; mostly &quot; mostly for the co@@ alition partner , it must not be shown .
there is something dr@@ unk , what could fight for disp@@ ute .
but the SPD is now att@@ empt@@ ing to pro@@ filed in the topic of internal security .
Part@@ e@@ ich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel kin@@ al@@ izes a c@@ auti@@ ous meeting and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contribute to enhance safety . &quot;
Volkswagen gli@@ des still come through .
despite Diesel sk@@ and@@ als , the delivery costs rise worldwide .
but it is not going on in all markets .
in the recovery form , it is a term for the term .
Volkswagen starts to make deliveries in the second half of the year .
in the previous year , Europe &apos;s largest auto buil@@ ders can lead to a plus in spite of its many brands and some good @-@ circuit markets .
but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core mark@@ eted primarily in Western Europe and loaded the entire sale , as announced in the D@@ ax company .
worldwide , the VW brand sold in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the last year .
the deliveries of the home market Germany pur@@ ged the deliveries of almost a sixth .
brand tri@@ eb@@ ler@@ f Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the we@@ aker numbers from July particularly to two sales days fewer in Europe .
in addition , it also has given a mer@@ chan@@ ge@@ over in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote for the withdrawal from the EU also dis@@ bur@@ den@@ ed a female speaker .
in the U.S. , where the exhaust gas supplies first es@@ cal@@ ated , also a minus to beech .
great support for VW is Chinese market .
overall , the mainly concerned house of the Lower Saxony has more gli@@ ster@@ ly due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an output of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles are at beech .
Group CFO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to propos@@ e a sales spl@@ itter from January to July .
in that period , 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered in this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had t@@ amp@@ ered with a software exhaust tests .
in Germany alone , VW employs some 2.5 million cars for converting in the workshops .
in the course of conversion super@@ vised VW , the conversion of cars did not affect any negative effects .
according to the conversion of vehicles , it offers fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output no fault .
the car manufacturer is based on the customer in retro@@ fitting a &quot; guarantee certificate &quot; certificate but not of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was named on Friday .
reason be legal ent@@ ities .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen won his German customers now a guarantee for short @-@ equipped diesel models .
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the traffic department has been confirmed that there were meeting .
&quot; VW has performed the re@@ jection of my investig@@ ating Commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; variations of which are not accepted , &quot; stated by the Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the Ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output according to the conversion has no deter@@ ior@@ ations , and all typical approval processes remain unchanged .
Volkswagen is about the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not what was named in corporate travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also important to avoid making it possible in certain other damages that even have nothing to do with the ab@@ g@@ ass@@ al sc@@ andal , which comes to an un@@ certain@@ ty in any warranty , as it was called .
this is why we do not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Raiffeis@@ enbank G@@ mund is requested by rich as@@ par@@ agus in the future - as the second Institute in Germany .
Bank chief Josef Paul said : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers that share 40 million euros on sight or daily use . &quot;
the German banks of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal : normal as@@ par@@ agus , &quot; not fear for their savings to pay criminal charges . &quot;
keep bank money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay 0.4 % penalty .
this charge requires Raiffeis@@ enbank G@@ mund starting in September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposits back .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euro in the year , &quot; Paul said .
he has been hil@@ ly since bad time 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the others and which he could not .
&quot; the bank account for me on the Central Bank account and account 0.4 percent of charge , &quot; said the bank .
&quot; I can &apos;t lie down for every one million euros . &quot;
the cost he now give thanks to the caus@@ al principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most clients could have understanding and changes to other plant forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
the Gen@@ ossen@@ schaft association of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB will cause significant money at all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ al interest for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People &apos;s and Raiffeis@@ enbank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land made head@@ line head@@ lines in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , the CEO of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said that there is a cli@@ ent@@ ele in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see who is equipped with something l@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if this blog is a news report on TV , I would follow the camera , while I run in a slow street in S@@ oho , a hum@@ ble grey suit , before I stand up , my hands hold and a bit dis@@ playing . &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let us take a look on it .
even if the heart of So@@ hos is entering into his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sales were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would pres@@ um@@ ably ask the camera to strike the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such businesses and try to ass@@ ess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : eight men middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long due to a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
this record , pictured above ( he sent me the sn@@ ap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dressing the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available disposable income : it is now able to buy boards , which he could not aff@@ ord to buy and again buy items he sold as he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the medium m@@ ash , people who have heard about the com@@ eb@@ ack , and causes some to buy their old plates .
from the talks that I led , people usually have taken care of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy back their records , &quot; he says .
this would account the boom on tra@@ ilers of a particular al@@ ters .
but what about the alle@@ ged emotional meaning of records ?
it will take only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ on@@ ica to recognize that turn@@ ips offers a cal@@ ming community of equal incl@@ usion .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers im@@ presses the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overcome by the digital world and would like to with@@ draw the stability of conf@@ id@@ ential noise envelop@@ es , of objects that che@@ er@@ ate happy youth up .
&quot; I guess it is sometimes the col@@ t of a void or poss@@ ess material acquisition than a type of Tro@@ st , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that is so with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; have a staff of a stack stack .
a pol@@ l of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of those who purchased a record they did not have listen@@ ed to a record .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table that never will use them while 7 % of those who want a record , don &apos;t have a record player .
at this point of news , I would probably look very wor@@ ried , while I st@@ ills at Bos@@ sa Nova compos@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works at the sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( data number : three men of middle age ) has a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ val .
&quot; someone first came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio @-@ head record , so that I can set them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a huge percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive @-@ duty , less music load .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who will only be cle@@ ans@@ ed .
a mo@@ p that has dedicated the record almost a whole course , has a big audience going as I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists , making photos , teen@@ agers and women middle age .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned business - Wild Be@@ asts new syn@@ thesis - and up@@ dating pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ umm@@ ers of the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such di@@ vers@@ ity with the customer .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ iat@@ rist@@ a are hard to conce@@ ive , when standing next to someone 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and consi@@ ders the variety of plates for selling boards .
it is more of a window man@@ ne@@ que than a large purchase .
they deser@@ ves not much , therefore the collecting from plates has no real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; they are driving with a loved Se@@ uf@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is told by saying that a new generation of record lovers should be inspired by Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the note to sample the je@@ ans hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teenage cameras , before a father and his daughter transl@@ ate himself to buy a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left , there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of panels of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ e@@ house and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody can see them in - perhaps because they are pu@@ rely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to capture it .
it is pure &quot; turn@@ able art . &quot;
but in consider@@ ing that each attraction in these items do more money for the industry , and some customers could not send into the dep@@ ths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , also that is , most of the luxury objects such as boards .
even if my research were enth@@ ron@@ ed that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote you , at least in record stores in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , who exist in reality , sheet stores , and in online for@@ ums .
these people are pres@@ um@@ ably work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with certain@@ ties with ash@@ ions of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while at the star@@ ing view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator me@@ adows that occurred on the shoulders of the middle age .

French Court rejected lef@@ to@@ ver and demol@@ ishing shops in the jungle camp .
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ zens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , live in the thousands of refugees .
with a court case this week was ar@@ gu@@ ing the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be ordered to sell 72 temporary shops within the camp of goods , selling cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , hair@@ dress@@ age services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or basic meals for a few euros in t@@ ent@@ ative restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture are gu@@ essed that these places should be c@@ torn down , because they would not be paid to a parallel economy , they would not be paid out of taxes and a risk and risk of fire .
&quot; humanit@@ arian groups part@@ n@@ ered with that the shops and restaurants are important , since the free meals are offered by state @-@ supported union and other groups that we would not provide enough foo@@ d@@ stu@@ ffs for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the mak@@ or@@ ic shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people , but cle@@ ared the 72 temporary shops , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture &quot; were completely re@@ trac@@ table . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the food stores , caf@@ es and restaurants would play a much bigger role as people live in extremely pre@@ k@@ arian conditions . &quot;
he said that the ranges offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the re@@ treat was the Jungle Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is a non @-@ profit run and 200 meals a day , English - and French as well as advice on asylum applications for the hundreds of protection need@@ y , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the pet@@ ition to keep the Kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure of the closure of the children of a cat@@ astrophe would be from which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ mussen exhibit to the next generation of speed monitors : in different states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are being tested particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic acting du@@ ck trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic in Wiesbaden can be used for example at random numbers , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway buildings or to cross @-@ country bridges with temporary speed limit , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a high speed limit .
it can be a permanent mobile platform but can be too dangerous and consum@@ ing .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement mode . data transfer data will be transmitted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at a time .
variable speed limit and access rate according to time , driving , and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ folded state , one can trailer the trailer according to manufacturers with automatic trailer hit@@ ch .
so that he is not simply st@@ owed , it is lo@@ wered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels are in the arm@@ oured and also van@@ ish external jack@@ ets .
it should also protect a built @-@ in alarm system against V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is being tested according to the Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign agencies also flas@@ hes with the new technique : recently , France has generated 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ched silver in 7 @-@ bit Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold .
the impressive performance of Great Britain when the 7 @-@ spe@@ c Rug@@ by came to a halt at the final hur@@ dle in the form of the fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ od@@ oro Stadium .
Fi@@ ji shared a master@@ class in handling , Side @-@ ste@@ pping , post @-@ back , line run and rust , to win Gold - their first Olympics of any color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ oting , 7 @-@ 5 in sem@@ if@@ in@@ als on the same day could fall down in the final .
but in this form , Fi@@ ji had hit a 15 @-@ man team in top shape .
it could be a Tro@@ st for GB - but it probably won &apos;t be - that at least a ro@@ ite morning got a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Che@@ f@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult track behind him .
eight years ago , they lost under Ryan every game near the Adelaide Se@@ v@@ ens .
they just lost one here .
this fl@@ ap is we@@ ary , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji has started wonderful and had the attacks of sp@@ ass off .
it felt right for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in , when I would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with only four minutes of playing game Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai left another assault on the right corner that he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly tr@@ acked the ball .
a fier@@ ce t@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stopped the mount of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal but Fi@@ ji had just stopped .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua met in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ plac@@ ard and still had over one minute running time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ dict@@ ated by further weak t@@ ack@@ lings of the GB teams and sk@@ ipped to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is like Fi@@ ji to do so was to play 7 , while the GB is still developing .
it is that way .
GB introduced fundamental changes for half @-@ time and ended the fi@@ ji@@ an l@@ ücke ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a br@@ illi@@ antly cli@@ p@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , making a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game already ran for a long time in favour of the southern se@@ ins@@ an , whose fans flo@@ un@@ ks , flags b@@ ends and d@@ anced at the trib@@ une .
it was not hard to see Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s play@@ ful approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame continued the i cone with another try in the last seconds .
the wh@@ ist@@ le rays , the fi@@ j@@ is em@@ brac@@ ed and the GB of be@@ aded wal@@ k@@ ingly ro@@ oted in the la@@ wn .
early on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defeat and Great Britain in a cr@@ ack of sem@@ itone from the race - British conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the win@@ ks in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke through the line with an impressive foot and scored one goal under the posts in the second half .
a br@@ illi@@ antly late t@@ ack@@ ling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ ited team secured the gain - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by fighting with the cancer of a coach to a rowing victory
there will be no emotional gold than in these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first t@@ aller until the last , 220 har@@ sh h@@ ie@@ ve that goes into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat on the rud@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all@@ present to the second Olympics in a row without tax@@ ed , the first women in the history of British Sports , who used to a scale .
its domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least the money la@@ z@@ ener used , which is un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two br@@ illi@@ ant athl@@ ete which reflec@@ ts about the surface with the elegance of its tears , which does not reflect the type of tri@@ umph@@ s .
behind every gold in the rowing machine there is a batt@@ al@@ ion of willing hel@@ pers that make the difference and there was no hel@@ pl@@ ess than the coach , who would not know if he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed .
how he said he is ris@@ ky .
I had bub@@ ble cancer that is oper@@ able and they did so .
if you do not do it , he spread everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was fortun@@ ate that he could be the treatment beginning of 2014 , out of season , start out what the dis@@ rupt@@ ing was at a minimum , in case of such circumstances om@@ it the correct term .
I needed money , so I needed to go back soon .
it was a stim@@ ul@@ ant .
I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
the rowing on itself is a challenge , but it is still a bigger one .
in the in@@ fert@@ ility of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who took some more ner@@ ve in the morning to speak some more than anything and trying to process his own fe@@ ars .
the p@@ anning , which was as the Captain of the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in one deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely but it means so much . &quot;
it is only repe@@ ating how much me means that , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you for him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would not have a better person to exercise or wish for better train@@ ers .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which her opponent did not keep up .
even in the past 500 meters to join the teams from New Zealand and Denmark , the anning and Glo@@ ver had been too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; ble@@ ib in the case , stay in the case . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to be able to ri@@ p .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not on to make some Great Tol@@ les .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win what we did .
the couple will take out for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , its own with the TV @-@ adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she &apos;s just going to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that I was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I &apos;m a Olympics .
everything was so new for me and I was so st@@ ressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , long @-@ term for clarity .
the managing director of the &quot; Ve@@ it@@ ching Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , will re@@ tire .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian far . &quot;
a small fr@@ ug@@ al drinking water joined as model for the large water producer .
so it was some time ago in the original one with the Bavarian Radio contribution .
a little later the water forum continued by the French government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
the work of the Ve@@ it Group came to &quot; Bay@@ ern@@ far as ex@@ empl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zwe@@ ck@@ verband employees , it was 28 years of managing director .
he was re@@ tire at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ level Association of the Ve@@ it Group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 15@@ 0,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 locations and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants annually .
member communities are the churches of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ sh@@ s@@ bach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
water supply contracts for more cities and municip@@ alities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ ling Mayor , Gertrud Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water @-@ keeper in 1988 and has been appointed CEO of the association .
&quot; his tasks are very varied and they dis@@ pers@@ ed from water management and maintenance activities , bud@@ get@@ ary plans and fees , calculation of fees and contributions to weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events she called the commission@@ ing and inaugur@@ ation of the new foun@@ tains ( 1994 ) , gro@@ unding companies in the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of a central Computer @-@ controller ( 2004 ) and the re@@ ren@@ dering of water pipes ( 2004 ) .
there have never been n@@ urs@@ ing and we ever tried again , because water life de@@ bri@@ des and drinking water the most important foo@@ d@@ stu@@ ffs .
in their Lau@@ d@@ atio , they compli@@ ments G@@ öl@@ lers , reliable and accurate service over 31 years .
he used himself with a lot of heart o@@ bl@@ ings for his water @-@ purpose association and he regularly became his own company .
a few weeks ago , he received the successful concept of the Ve@@ it@@ ching Group to the nit@@ rate of nit@@ rate in front of the county town of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ lu@@ sted Wasser@@ wart Alf@@ ons Grie@@ bel from working together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water keeper and he was a loy@@ al .
together we were a unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point , he described the Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the re@@ start of the association .
the biggest challenge and most difficult use were the collapse of the flood at Kirch@@ lou@@ der , on the 3rd of January .
at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work through , so that the local@@ ities could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn has one time to maintain , because you filled the containers of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water sports association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who represents the suc@@ cession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ te@@ he@@ ide - man sho@@ ots for life science
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man died on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ te@@ he@@ ide ( room Stor@@ mar@@ n ) to his partner in and in@@ ju@@ red it .
&quot; the man called on us and stated to have shot his life of life , &quot; said a police officer .
the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors be upon the run , after him will be public .
it is now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters large , mus@@ cular , brown burned and has a Gl@@ ory .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile one man bears a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be touched directly .
he could carry the weapon in itself , so the police are .
who doesn &apos;t see Sven S. , the 110 is supposed to call .
the police speaks of relationship relations . &quot;
the sacrifice was born in 1988 , the 1981 offen@@ ders .
the compet@@ ent police in Lübeck , initially wanted to make any indic@@ ations to the co@@ ather@@ fall or the relationship between per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors and victims , however , they confirmed that a human being killed .
&quot; it is a killing sp@@ ells . &quot;
&quot; we currently do not say , &quot; a police officer said in Lübeck .
according to eye@@ witnesses , a special procedure ( SEK ) at the crime scene .
steel - In@@ gl@@ azed at the German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed at an additional costs of one @-@ one @-@ height .
financial loads applied by the industry in the east @-@ current promotion are from the table .
it remained at the Liber@@ ation of Ren@@ ewable Energy Energ@@ ies in the German St@@ ah@@ lin@@ dustrie in the German St@@ ah@@ lin@@ dustrie , President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; Western German General Newspaper . &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday Edition ) .
&quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve that after two years of f@@ enced negotiations . &quot;
initially planned , the European Commission planned to use steel manufacturers , use G@@ ase made from the up@@ heav@@ al gas for power generation to ask for the c@@ ash@@ ier .
the steel industry reports additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year after the German industry association .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there &apos;s now a certificate with the European Commission after talks with competition reb@@ elling in Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when gener@@ ators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG real@@ location of 20 percent is added .
but these will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the un@@ ification of Germany with the EU Commission for its own power generation .
the status Quo of the previous regulations will be largely determined to date .
special significance have the successful colours of Gabriel on the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; Steel is Future &apos; that is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more we will have to follow . &quot;
&quot; at the reform of emission limits , climate change and employment goals are being written , &quot; IG Metall b@@ oss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
since the financial crisis in Europe , the steel industry in Europe suff@@ ers from over@@ capacities and an enormous price pressure .
last year , the situation further wor@@ ship@@ ed , as the world &apos;s largest producer , made China in view of the we@@ aker demand steel to the world market .
European producers design@@ ate Chinese steel contrac@@ tion prize money .
the situation has a bit relaxed over this spring .
the in@@ dispens@@ able incl@@ usion of import joint effect , for others the economic prospects changed in China .
it is un@@ clear how sustain@@ ably the pri@@ et@@ ition is .
the German industry pri@@ m Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
last , prices have been st@@ agn@@ ated .
the sector respon@@ ds to the difficult position with further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to do not exclu@@ de some of the occas@@ ions of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain safe despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced more than six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , as the economic agreement of steel was announced on Friday .
after a brief raise in May , the quantity produced now back to the second month .
production has been around two percent since the start of the year .
the association will pay in the coming months with improved order back@@ lash .
community , spirit , health : singing and sen@@ iors good
she managed Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp already accompanied all her life : as young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the comp@@ artment music and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ ings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emot@@ ionally and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a sample she feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and overall live , she says .
at the same time , she does something good for her health and mind .
because S@@ ingen is a great ho@@ bby for sen@@ iors , who says Erhard Hack@@ ler from the German Sen@@ ior@@ en@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors are singing in the choir and shared with rec@@ alling the joy of music , describes Hack@@ ler .
sen@@ iors can take and maintain social contacts through regular mer@@ gers .
because often social and family structures described in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ipp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organ@@ ise themselves to the others and learn from each other - a special choir is a special form of collapse . &quot;
sing can be str@@ en@@ uous in the positive sense , thin@@ ks of Hack@@ ler .
there is a deep and controlled breath .
those who calls his l@@ ungs regularly , even in everyday life , not so fast from the P@@ ust@@ e .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in age , singing makes a perfect ho@@ bby .
many people often have a special effect on older people , Ursula L@@ enz says of the Federal Emp@@ loyment Research Foundation .
in the older generations , the collective S@@ ingen had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs in older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of youth time .
lyrics and mel@@ o@@ dies are sin@@ king themselves to themselves long history of mel@@ o@@ dies .
in singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time to focus on your own voice and at a given rhythm and adapt the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
even el@@ derly people who live alone , do not only exercise themselves to focus yourself .
another positive aspect is the acknowled@@ gement that one drives through the singing in the choir , thin@@ ks of Hack@@ ler .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is growing through the singing in the choir .
yourself to say : if I do something for something I am better and watch out beyond me - this experience strength@@ ens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
W@@ ho@@ ever wants to try a new ho@@ bby , should not hes@@ itate - even if he has a little tal@@ ent , av@@ eng@@ ed L@@ enz .
one s@@ ings not alone - at 50 singing men who he@@ ars , if a clay go to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says Hack@@ ler .
if someone s@@ ings from the famous circuit in a senior ench@@ man , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church .
you can also find many senior ench@@ y@@ irs on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask family , friends or neighbo@@ urs around the Internet .
who would like to sing is to join in a choir , supplies dul@@ ler .
sing the soul good and has something liber@@ ated - this is true for every age .
cats re@@ acting as a cr@@ ater on ter@@ ror the young animals
biolog@@ ists studied in Hanover , which effect has the effect of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise , the Mi@@ irs had not left the male too cold - however , they still stopped in the difference to the females always .
Female cats may recognize the most of the babies from K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on the mi@@ th@@ of the little ones .
they react faster by ten percent faster on lu@@ te of Kitt@@ ens which have chosen in large ad@@ versity as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
hang@@ over also respond to the calls of kit@@ ties - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the height of less and strongly ero@@ ded boys for the males are either not perce@@ ived or not by meaning , &quot; the biolog@@ ist Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said about the MH@@ H .
it is first independent of the study published on Friday in the trade magazine &quot; BM@@ C E@@ vol@@ u@@ tionary Biology &quot; trade journal .
in a previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens f@@ righ@@ ten diff@@ ers with urg@@ ency of their help need@@ y .
a total of nine adult hang@@ s and eight sco@@ ot@@ ers were observed from the MH@@ H li@@ vest@@ ock hus@@ band@@ ry .
one of the little ones of the little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the litter box and were separated from mother and sisters .
secon@@ dly , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with ter@@ ies of stronger coo@@ kie , which were also high@@ lighted .
the researchers hold their results despite the low sample of interest .
&quot; all females , even those who had no one &apos;s own , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned faster for loud@@ speakers , when this calls played the very high k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability is possibly born or develop with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males ever responded to ever , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist .
in the past scientists have already investig@@ ated the reactions of women and men in bab@@ y@@ noise .
there were some studies shown that women re@@ acted to babies , whether they were already moth@@ ers , or not reported by the biolog@@ ist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
po@@ dol@@ ski runs with &quot; Gala &quot; in Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ iss@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant had been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terror@@ ist group .
an important soccer game takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey .
before the fight between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sk@@ is Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul about the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line : &quot; business as usual &quot; is called .
already in July , the government of appeal comm@@ enced by the government of extra@@ dition in July , the government of norm@@ alities will not be affected .
this does not apply to those who susp@@ ect the susp@@ ect &apos;s movement of the Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
but it is not just the case before football .
he issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ook .
he is being accused of being accused of terror@@ ist group in America , by being a member of the terror@@ ist group .
the decision should be responsible for the &quot; Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len &quot; held by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup attempt .
although this state of emergency relief is still valid for 90 days , but in fact , it actually has no effect on the life of most Turks .
the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; in public places throughout the country has extended Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for its end .
Sports is - like the whole country - divided into suppor@@ ters and oppon@@ ents of Erd@@ og@@ ans .
particularly fans of the working club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are tradition@@ ally not counted among the friends of the President .
but in view of the Turks , however , in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict re@@ jection of military co@@ aches .
even the fans agree - no matter whether you be@@ ats your heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at the winner g@@ ala &quot; Gala , it will be travelling very soon to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
in 2011 , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old presented his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ or@@ er of his association with 17 T@@ oren and nine templates .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ victory @-@ points .
the newspaper &quot; FAN@@ A@@ TIK &quot; celebrated him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season took place for the record competition an reconc@@ il@@ able completion .
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; could say early in the Europe League early .
he &apos;s only extended to rank six in the south .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed and that is the most important thing , &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said .
the game was better for master Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
most of all thanks Mario Gom@@ ez , who finished with 26 seas@@ onal go@@ ers as Sü@@ ver @-@ L@@ ig @-@ Tor@@ sch@@ ütz@@ en@@ yi ev@@ ens the basis of the 14th title .
this is also the reason that fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year old .
the land@@ lord was handed over by the AC Florence under contract and gave us only cher@@ ished Gom@@ ez after the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , because of the political situation in the country after his European vacation .
&quot; if Mario has to come to us , he must say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the storm@@ s would have to be ready , but in order to ren@@ ounce a third of its estimated top 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man asked : &quot; its content in Florence cannot be able to pay . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have even more medals in Olympia in Rio .

when it was stated that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
yet there are many more sport@@ s@@ men who go through the Rio in spite of D@@ oping @-@ Past to the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most contro@@ versi@@ al figures in the athle@@ tics .
he had been locked two times because of Dop@@ pler ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
since its B@@ ann the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , in 9,80 seconds , he is the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bolt .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ fold Olympic champion and seven times the world champion had to sit a six @-@ month lock after you have proven the pain of the pain using the Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after an operation he had a severe dent@@ ist , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world championship in 2013 and European Championship from 2010 to 2016 was positiv@@ ely tested on the banned stim@@ ul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic test@@ ify the sent@@ ee and was closed for six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big Gold@@ favor@@ it@@ in .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and branches of over 400 m , was tested positive and closed for 21 months in 2010 .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , Mer@@ ritt Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest men ever since .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( ham@@ mer@@ ed , Belarus ) : probably many medals were detected afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later , after compl@@ eting Test@@ oster@@ one D@@ oping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of test@@ oster@@ one abuse .
he also received the 2004 Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille before the 2008 Olympic Games Convention , following a verdict of the International Sports Court .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranked 3rd in the world leader board .

fire ter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ations in@@ ju@@ red - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday early .
she suffered persec@@ ution and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already for@@ s@@ aken this .
she planned her home journey to the beginning of September .
if there are further explo@@ sions on the vac@@ ations island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in constant contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ öll .
in the roughly 200 kilometres south of the capit@@ ol Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in , first two bom@@ bs were explo@@ ded on Thursday evening .
according to police , police have been killed and about 20 people had been in@@ ju@@ red , among them Austrian finds , three German , three Dutch and three Italian .
Friday morning again two jumps were high , according to the authorities , a further man was killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bom@@ b explo@@ de was reported in the morning .
in the Det@@ on@@ ation near the travel@@ ers popular swimming pool Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red according to police data .
Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country explo@@ ded another bom@@ b which killed an urban employees .
the spr@@ inkl@@ ing was set to the air in a flower me@@ adows before the remains of the coastal police in the air .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations stip@@ ulated in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on at the southeast coast several in@@ ju@@ red .
you go from a link with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bom@@ bing rate carry the same manus@@ cript , &quot; said Ar@@ qu@@ egen@@ er@@ al Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before the journalist .
&quot; we anticip@@ ate that it is a coordin@@ ated attack . &quot;
it &apos;s too early to express something different mot@@ if@@ s - probably handle it to the de@@ eds of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to recognize the attacks in the south of the country for the bom@@ bing of Muslim det@@ ectors in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , declared the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terror@@ ism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age that restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
they also imagine that the bom@@ bs were planted by the ruling from the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in the last days , authorities have been given secret references to imp@@ ending attacks in the south of the country - however , they wer@@ en &apos;t be informed about the exact time and places .
nor be un@@ clear , which group is behind the attacks .
police killed their offici@@ als throughout the country , security around an important govern@@ mental office , as well as airports , railway stations , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement distri@@ cts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ edly smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by King B@@ hum@@ ib@@ ol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j over the years .
after the nice bom@@ b explo@@ sions the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends his home to make the instructions of the Thai safety authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) provided for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Song@@ h@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ as and its en@@ vir@@ ons .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim pop@@ ulations , there will be no necessary travel in these provinces .
increased risk of safety ( Level 2 ) provided for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday a few days after a referendum held on a referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
this forces occup@@ ies the military a great impact in the years ahead .
Jun@@ ta b@@ oss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CHA said the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to cra@@ yons chaos , while the country is toward stability , to improve economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had se@@ ized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody up@@ rest , holds itself to maintain the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , the military has also failed to get the ex@@ u@@ prising of Muslim reb@@ els in the extreme south of the country since years .
in the conflict , more than 6500 people were killed .
nearly a year ago in Bangkok also were killed in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du de@@ pu@@ rely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody assault of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional System .
according to several off@@ ors , the Constitutional Arm@@ ies have also made the group under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity &apos; movement for fun@@ er@@ ings against the un@@ common democratic principles , &quot; said : Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus immig@@ rants will diff@@ use bl@@ am@@ ous Islamic faith or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist manner .
that is why we observe the movement now too .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
they turn to &quot; mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ alism &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass mig@@ ration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity . &quot;
const@@ itutional prot@@ ector in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - watch the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said that his authority is closely coordin@@ ated with the pro@@ positions .
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the const@@ itu@@ tion@@ ist .
generally , extre@@ mist@@ s , they often speak with y@@ outh@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ ing music .
the armed Islam@@ ists as well as Right @-@ experts trem@@ ists .
this is no ad@@ orable advertising for their own .
the pro@@ paganda is to ad@@ mit the people emot@@ ionally .
young people are pr@@ one in special ways .
this is dangerous .
recently , there have been reports of members of &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; on Af@@ raid polit@@ icians from several German states .
Ma@@ ate said he has no knowledge of knowledge .
possible contacts of this species can only be relevant from a certain point relevant .
it is ensu@@ red whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ d - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist , its target changes and so extrem@@ ist will become extrem@@ ist .
so , whether such persons are tax@@ ed , tax@@ ing on the party .
this is not recogn@@ iz@@ able .
with a view to the significant increase of law@@ ful off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refuge@@ e arri@@ vals , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context not by new right terror@@ ism .
but in recent years , we have seen that it can be right @-@ terror@@ ist structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be true that further law@@ ful group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , are planning for refuge@@ e appe@@ ar@@ ances or attacks from other legal patterns .
an in @-@ wide or European control of right @-@ terror@@ ism is not recogn@@ iz@@ able .
the previous groups were created on regional levels or social networks .
Ma@@ ate wor@@ ried about how many handles went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying legend .
many of the susp@@ ect in attacks are not previously known as cri@@ min@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated criminal or suppor@@ ters of the right scene .
&quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences who had been doing nothing in different with right decisions , perhaps polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Lin@@ ke , have radi@@ cally under@@ stated by right @-@ wing mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
they are not always set up the Olympic news or world record head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the cour@@ age@@ ous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros for the summer play in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sponge the slightly over@@ weight pig@@ s from Ethiopia is so slow that he was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
it simply van@@ ished - no matter how far the selection has been selected .
Hab@@ te became the vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it in social networks .
in fact the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a gap of 48 seconds off his outlet and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
it was rather his not a sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participated in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got special starting from the international floating association .
this is distributed to make swimming in the present countries of well @-@ present countries .
because in Eth@@ op@@ ia most sport@@ s@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media described him as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the W@@ al . &quot;
in re@@ jection to a &quot; pro@@ sper@@ ity &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ let &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; made it fun .
his time , he just beat at a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of fre@@ estyle years , he played no role .
the same with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .

an accident of a travel report with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers were held on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ audi@@ ble ( district Aur@@ ich ) eight people .
two of the in@@ m@@ ates suffered severe in@@ jur@@ ies , shared by the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisenach , according to an op@@ posing lam@@ ster , had to turn off the opposite track .
the bus came down to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into an coun@@ table , like an inter@@ phone in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the situation of the bus , people could not leave the bus sel@@ ective , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six b@@ ail@@ out car and emergency vehicles came to the accident at the state road 2 .
the in@@ ju@@ red travel@@ ers were brought back to the Kr@@ umm@@ audi@@ ble district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there you should wait for a replacement bus of the travelling company .
the investig@@ ator demanded the load drivers and possible witnesses to report at the police .
the fees per cubic meter will be from 1 October 2016 onwards for the area of waste water at Ne@@ ud@@ orf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 Euro ; for Al@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously : 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
in the plant in Az@@ endorf , waste water at the latest will once again increase when appropriate improvements needs to be needed .
after a relevant calculation , the wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as may@@ or Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the budget &apos;s approval was established by the Land@@ r@@ ats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach so that for these se@@ wer@@ age plants were dis@@ cover@@ ies .
ow@@ ing to the legal foundations , the market is oblig@@ ed to operate facilities at the grounds .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens and the industrial and industrial enterprises are made from Wel@@ d@@ enk@@ ahl , Ne@@ ud@@ orf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg de@@ eper in the w@@ allet .
the stock increases between 48 and 67 percent .
like management of Herbert Schmidt , the Board of directors , was necessary to rene@@ w the charges for the san@@ itation of the market water .
over@@ time and dis@@ cover@@ ies from the previous col@@ ular period will be reduced from October 2016 to September 2020 respectively .
this increases the gra@@ v@@ ings engine increases by all three se@@ wer@@ age systems by relatively small facilities , with a very low se@@ wer@@ age , between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
due to the low distribution of reference , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have cru@@ cif@@ ying .
se@@ wer@@ age may also be slightly lower in all three systems .
in the under@@ lying col@@ ular period in all three plants last were not least fallen due to their age re@@ habilitation and repair expenses in a substanti@@ al scale .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the plant for Wel@@ der ahl , Ne@@ ud@@ orf and Re@@ uth as well as Al@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp . almost 20 years .
Schmidt p@@ amp@@ ered on that in the w@@ ast@@ e@@ water plant Az@@ endorf had to ex@@ changed the mechanical ventilation system because of damage .
in the pump station Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl had to over@@ hau@@ led almost 20 years of old conveyor systems for almost 20 years , the first we@@ ather@@ proof facility had to be fitted and an additional ventilation possibility to ensure that the water @-@ legal requirements must also be able to hold in future .
Schmidt : &quot; these special remedi@@ es came to this extraordinary super@@ visor and maintenance cost , which are to be considered in the new col@@ ular period . &quot;
the same applies for electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that in the three plants the applications put the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
this has been supple@@ mented by Schmidt , the market@@ place of great entertainment costs for the se@@ wer@@ age plants in the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to stay pre@@ dict@@ ate according to view of stone houses in Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al about these installations can not be enlarged because it is about def@@ icient facilities .
Bulgaria in@@ doors for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first has zero since October last year , when positive 0,2 % had been posted .
the annual average flow of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the index was compared to June 2016 compared to June 2016 , that means that the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate has been compared to December 2015 at the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) and the annual inflation amounted to -@@ 0.2 % in July 2016 .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; D@@ istr@@ ations and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
the prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine halt ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained like in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuel ; communication ; and education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian @-@ car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is animated series , but some ob@@ servers are saying that it is un@@ sen@@ sible against races .
with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat approximately 150 million daily readers to change the reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already sc@@ attered by the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can transform yourself into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein paintings .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ ossom , in@@ spir@@ ing tools that produce more than 30 million selenium per day .
all mis@@ ses will go to the public .
sn@@ ap filters have gone on themselves in the past , where they accused the Black@@ face promoted or white skin than beauty ideal .
when this week sm@@ all@@ ying a filter a filter cut off the sl@@ ot@@ ings , false teeth and ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated che@@ eks , there was some critics of a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; j@@ aun@@ ts . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated conflic@@ ts have been hin@@ dered to a larger problem , that the company has with diversity .
the news and the dis@@ closure were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it could de@@ activate the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter has been thought to be an hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders that rac@@ ism have experienced , the filter remin@@ ded of breaking c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail you wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose Twe@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter has been vul@@ ner@@ able and e@@ ager@@ ly talked un@@ pleasant . &quot;
it added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the object of a very contra@@ dic@@ tive Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not las@@ ered , but it was pulled off the yellow .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that cros@@ ses this cultural tunnel .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration process , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand .
and sn@@ ap@@ shots big audience of young people - the things of race di@@ vers@@ er than their older ones - could expect more of them out , sen@@ sibility to expect awareness .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters a picture produces , &quot; it is much more difficult for a user when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium to er@@ ase your Snap@@ chat account , asked for others to do the same .
in a setup for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that it might believe that rac@@ ted contro@@ versi@@ es have caused a lack of di@@ vers@@ ity at the practices in sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part white , only male leadership and finished their attachment with h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chin@@ ese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have done people with other skin colors , they work there , but not in positions which they are safe or feel what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint about the sn@@ are chat mostly un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures to di@@ vers@@ at@@ ement of its workforce and shows up to its status as private companies .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat started to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaking voice , the company recently set a personnel manager based on inter@@ linked population groups and on internal integration .
Z@@ hu instru@@ cted you that she will be closed her sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not o.@@ k. . &quot;
military leadership F@@ ake off ISIS secret services , ex@@ port@@ ing Committee of Congress
military personnel in the United States Central Command was al@@ tered in order to draw an optimal image of war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it allows the actual states of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of the re@@ publi@@ can committee , secret service committee , reported by great dis@@ satis@@ faction , as reported by great dis@@ satis@@ faction to Central Command Staff in the struggle against the Islamic State .
central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida that controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; message of information provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , marked a positive picture of the American efforts against terror@@ ism , when the actual states occurred on site , and were consistently positive as analyses of other mess@@ aging services , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; what is happening in Cent@@ Com , is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers will be present if bad analyses of our political leaders , &quot; asked Ken Cal@@ vert , re@@ publi@@ can member of the House of Re@@ present@@ atives .
the Cent@@ Com &apos;s guide is suff@@ ici@@ ently reaching the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ side report shows in detail with significant problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Ira@@ qi forces .
although there &apos;s no direct indic@@ ations that government heads have given on Obama to dis@@ appearance the reports , it shows how an@@ alyst@@ s exposed to the pressure from their stat@@ ues , an optimal image from the threat of the Islamic State , known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many central Command Press Rele@@ ases , opinions and statements of the congress were clearly positive about the facts , presented the report .
for example , a Cent@@ Com belongs to the public , that a military return of mos@@ aic can already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the Islamic State control .
&quot; after months of investig@@ ations , so much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , a re@@ publi@@ can Congress pres@@ umed from Kan@@ sas , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 up to the middle of the year 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the official reports to record the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Re@@ public@@ ans called Task Force into life after them , that an@@ alyst@@ s felt wor@@ ried about manip@@ ulation from reports to Islam@@ ist state .
the report published on Thursday will be published by more detailed findings .
in addition , Cent@@ Com reports are conducted by the general spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense in G@@ ange .
Democratic members of the news service committee published their own knowledge on Thursday , with some of the concl@@ usions of the Republi@@ can Task Force on Thursday .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com ruled an exc@@ essi@@ v@@ ely limited process for creating retro@@ fitting restri@@ ctions on IS@@ IL and Ira@@ qi Security Service , the highest ranking of Re@@ mit@@ es , Adam B. Ship , announced in a statement .
this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of retro@@ fitting reports , &quot; the moral under an@@ alyst@@ s and &quot; gave a little room for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats have not found evidence of any inter@@ ven@@ tions of the White House at Cent@@ Com an@@ alyst@@ s in terms of &quot; certain political mind . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday through the daily Beast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times , investig@@ ations by the Pentagon &apos;s general spec@@ tor , reported by the complaints of Cent@@ Com An@@ alyst@@ s .
Lt@@ . C@@ md@@ r. Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ person on the Pentagon , gave no reports to the Congress that the Ministry of Defence would not be gained in progress during the investig@@ ations of the general inspection course .
but he also said that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the news service and the Ministry of Defence gre@@ et a contro@@ versi@@ al discussion on this important topic of national defence . &quot;
the investigation saw the question of a successful air@@ campaign in American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is made by a growing number of members from the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the criticism of last year , however , President Obama addressed to Central Command on military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism in secret information about the Islamic State re@@ mind when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a font closely resem@@ bled the recommendations of many an@@ alyst@@ s , just like a small occup@@ ying troops in Iraq and had a little time to conce@@ ive its consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in rebel@@ lion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after specif@@ ying government grounds , causing any significant impact on the financial situation of TER@@ RO@@ R@@ GR@@ U@@ PP@@ E , because these provis@@ ionally conditions had been put into operation , as they could sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times in September reported .
Cent@@ com@@ s then com@@ mander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his exc@@ essive positive assessment of the war in front of the Senate .
General Austin went into reti@@ rement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
USA &apos;s fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women who stands a show@@ down with Britain .
one day after she shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won &apos;t drive with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually indicate a mem@@ orable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they can &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I did not belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are identical in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place that remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will show up on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which the two teams hit the second and second place within their group .
the first placed second place will take a little bit longer out of the road leading to the other group .
as usual , the American woman likes to spread the Americans through their success story a surpris@@ ingly vor@@ tex , four years after the last London Games finished in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time in three years a ho@@ ckey bar in hands ( their two older sisters play the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they didn &apos;t qualify for the k@@ ader .
then came the year 2012 where she and her team went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an English , coach of the national team and so the things began to get better .
&quot; a cultural exchange , mental change and physical transition , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t had the working time at London , which we now have .
we can ri@@ p the ru@@ de completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Torre@@ mol@@ dings in the first half of the game with a feedback from the Middle East .
India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed a surpris@@ ingly f@@ enced and holding the status of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am entered the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with a flat ball through the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and sw@@ amp@@ ered the ball in the gate to get an 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Melissa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last square .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the gate of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to spend a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
exactly like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
am@@ id@@ st the base of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wher@@ ever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympics .
the events in Rio de J@@ ane@@ iro will feel constant and in@@ ev@@ itable , a fast relay between competition and str@@ uts .
it is , as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning bar , which will protect the arm@@ ory of the arm@@ ies to Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , you can read or listen to the TV via Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the disp@@ ute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s B with dimples , could definitely be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ looking TV advertising if he would be a sw@@ immer , Turner , or even fair@@ er .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fought in the Olympic trampoline around gold .
the Olympic flame does not lit any event equal .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are sports that are not widely recognised : air no@@ zzles , arch@@ ery , b@@ admin@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always swim with the breast and let it rule long .
but if I should make an argument for my particular property , then draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline is already an Olympic event since 2000 , when it was in Sydney , the last 16 years did not feel so much that I didn &apos;t know that there is a Olympic port at all .
that could also be regional ign@@ ance .
although athletes who were interested in the competition , has won &apos;t have a medal in jumping on a trampoline and made an athl@@ ete until 2012 .
the Chinese and the Rus@@ sians tend to share the prices of the men and the Chinese and the Canadian which are to share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on a trampoline has a certain exterior straight , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ checked ear of a c@@ low@@ ad@@ ful school for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only a thr@@ illed enthusi@@ ast .
it has a great potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never wanted pra@@ et@@ esses - but also the Gra@@ zie of the tournament and diving , the two kinds of sports that were essenti@@ ally re@@ united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; dates from the Spanish El Trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ inkl@@ ing . &quot;
rising champion jumping on a gig@@ an@@ tic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must end a series of falling movements ( turning , yeast and sal@@ ads ) before going on at the feet .
it will be evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram after performing , difficulty and &apos; flight time . &quot;
two thousand athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 females , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ed ho@@ pes have to continue in their stri@@ ving after Gold , quick@@ er , move up and down , sometimes up to the target , sometimes and back , down and down to the playground .
you will not only hunt the finish line or the source of output , but also in the TV transmission : the World or the Olympic Lord .
the target@@ ed stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atical - and it &apos;s enough to stir a viewer for tears .
but it is also that which I feel at watching this games as a little f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ing .
this trampoline offers a breath@@ break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
the moving movement is not the target .
he or she caught fire , se@@ em@@ ingly heavy as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , then down@@ wards , then down to the top .
there is a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal of no v@@ aul@@ ts into the distance , only the dre@@ am@@ ous , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qual@@ ifications and du@@ cks of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming to 13.00 Eastern Time , the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will ex@@ ude the ends as part of a afternoon blocks on both days and 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment that will probably survive in general tum@@ ult .
if the awareness of male athl@@ ete can only be achieved - how the male US @-@ Turner cannot be reached , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expected his coming air after air .
&quot; a generation is prot@@ est@@ ing in Ethiopia , Long an allies of the USA
viol@@ ent prot@@ ests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , policy changes in Ethiopia , thre@@ w the viol@@ ent opposition of the government .
witnesses are saying that sevent@@ y @-@ Protest@@ ants were killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia straight inter@@ v@@ om@@ iting ?
in the last ten years there was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid allies of the west with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , prot@@ ests against the government thre@@ w the country and expanded into more areas .
last week thousands of people storm@@ ed along the roads and desired fundamental political changes .
according to human rights , the government &apos;s response was un@@ mer@@ cif@@ ul .
witnesses gave him that polic@@ emen shot and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , some more than the prot@@ ests , which are pres@@ um@@ ably taken by the last or beginning of this year , show how sc@@ ur@@ ons of young people st@@ up@@ beat along with sho@@ cks during which this was forced to make a stand against a wall .
the b@@ oss of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands a in@@ coming examination .
&quot; it was always difficult to stop this country and future , &quot; Rash@@ id Ab@@ di , &quot; said Rash@@ id Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is home to the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be the west .
American military and secret services cooper@@ ate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror@@ ists over the region , in particular in Somalia . just a few countries in Africa , if ever , so much western help .
Ethiopia is expanding the tem@@ po .
its infrastructure has improved dra@@ st@@ ically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets usually are quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia is all other than an example for democracy - Human Rights Organ@@ izations represented by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ sid@@ ents increased effectively to silence .
many were sent to ex@@ ile or into prison , or driven into the flo@@ ods of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress and they don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ y@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in central Ethiop@@ ians .
the entire youth prot@@ ests .
a generation is prot@@ est@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to dign@@ ity in terms of power of the ruling co@@ alition .
following a wide election of the last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of opposition to now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the ten@@ sions desc@@ end along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for these tender , contro@@ versi@@ al line called in June hundreds of life .
an@@ alyst@@ s fear that separ@@ atist@@ as such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the Og@@ aden , who have been forced in the last years more or less , the tur@@ mo@@ il and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ ter@@ ness after years of the surface explo@@ de on the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years a lot of Ethiop@@ ian people were able to commun@@ icate with the social media , because cheaper smart phones were becoming more common , and the internet services improved .
even if the government lock access to Facebook and Twitter , especially in regular intervals , especially in prot@@ ests , many people still can commun@@ icate with Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide from where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians strug@@ gles to gather themselves to prot@@ ests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ n@@ ias in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since Ä@@ essions began the Am@@ har@@ as , the mainly of n@@ ivers@@ aries , pre@@ domin@@ antly in the politics and the economy , during which the Oro@@ mos ex@@ presses , of which many Muslims are living and in low@@ land areas .
but it just changes .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under one screen , &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest prot@@ ests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many am@@ id@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , representing around 6 percent of the population , which are dominant in military service , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former reb@@ els leading to his death in 2012 , became the prime minister of Israel to his death in 2012 .
he was considered tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think around corners .
an@@ alyst@@ s say that he was especially focused on dis@@ satis@@ faction to perce@@ ive early signs of dis@@ satis@@ faction and to make special bud@@ sman to handle oppon@@ ents and making it harm@@ less .
&quot; the present regime is missing in this basic captivity , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiopia New Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the South .
an@@ alyst@@ s say that he didn &apos;t enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ray @-@ controlled security services .
many fear that the result is more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time , Ethiopia was one such up@@ heav@@ al in 2005 after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested according to the government &apos;s analysis and were subsequently st@@ olen by the government .
many Protest@@ ants were killed during the following statements , even if there were less than in the last months and the time of turbul@@ ences resulted in a relatively fast time .
development experts in Ethiopia for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able adv@@ ances in poverty .
but apparently this has not avoided the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian Government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ical form .
the last month , Protest@@ ants in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , managed to run by Tig@@ ray and the H@@ ass over the Tig@@ ray is still pract@@ ised in social media .
an@@ alyst@@ s say that prot@@ ests to the US and the other Western allies into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for not@@ ion trips on the neighbor@@ ing Somalia , even when it recently announced that they closed this base .
while the West is clearly supporting democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to collapse his allies in an already vol@@ atile country .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin grat@@ ration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama created ISIS was created &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dis@@ per@@ se the last contro@@ vers@@ y of his campaign by foc@@ uss@@ ing that his multi @-@ repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would not be the &quot; fo@@ unders &quot; of TER@@ RO@@ R@@ GR@@ U@@ PP@@ E Islam@@ ist state , not taken seriously .
this clar@@ ification enh@@ ances new questions about the communication skills of the Re@@ public@@ ans , whether he is able to commun@@ icate well in the position to commun@@ icate with the American public .
it also brings his fellow country@@ men who stri@@ ve to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position , which he could not have meant .
after taking the hin@@ ge on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump brought back to his asser@@ tion on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really had not stated that President and Mrs. Clinton had made ISIS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was just being sar@@ c@@ astic .
the Twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the acc@@ us@@ ation completely serious .
when the conserv@@ ative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to ab@@ andon everything that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , wanted to know the re@@ publi@@ can pre@@ sidential candidate .
the last storm of criticism directed by Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he attemp@@ ts to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling changes to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stuck to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic .
he war@@ ned about Twitter that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would give suggestions to higher taxes , and he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has presented Sar@@ kas@@ mus on his defense .
in late July , he with@@ drew strong criticism of himself , when he said that Rus@@ sians should mo@@ w Mrs. Clin@@ tons , but he explained later &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method enables Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift l@@ ingu@@ istic bound@@ aries in politics and then return to rowing .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages come from his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; decl@@ are &quot; ever after the reaction . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication address that the language of both candidates is observed .
but I think he is cle@@ ver enough to hold away his statements v@@ age enough , so that they can be interpre@@ ted in various ways .
instead of the sound for the pre@@ sidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump accepted a mere tone , because his changes have gone further back .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a guided tour with a big jump in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attemp@@ ts to ap@@ olog@@ ize for his prov@@ oc@@ ative manifest@@ ations , he accused his critics often to dis@@ per@@ se or understand his laughter .
but as he stands in the focus of attention in recent months of his pre@@ sidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump filed his loy@@ al co@@ ws in the in@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ oc@@ ative would have his testim@@ onies also .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former may@@ or of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent adv@@ anc@@ ers , great efforts to defend today &apos;s CN@@ N interview in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; I believe what he says is leg@@ itim@@ ate , political comments &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked to say , Mr. Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that before Obama has an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ b@@ ishers , completely incor@@ rec@@ t and so it was because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most Ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government served as an Austrian minister in the Mrs. Clinton , as a foreign minister , led to broad to spread out the situation in the Middle East .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and re@@ lied on every one of his words , and against him pre@@ ju@@ red against him .
he gr@@ as@@ ped the &quot; poor , mis@@ er@@ able &quot; television channel , who try to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t get it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ott@@ led over Mr. Tr@@ ump exc@@ use as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for Pre@@ sidential amt .
once driven over the price of the market , caf@@ e gets back to green@@ point
ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ aming café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee served .
of course , the awards from his Bedford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed .
the business of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , selling soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people saw it as the last loss of gent@@ rif@@ ying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is a change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is , it is also something new .
a revi@@ val of the caf@@ e opened its last November in green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still fine .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodrig@@ u@@ ez , a long @-@ time staff of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained until the end .
when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new branch office , he was excited to do it .
Rodrig@@ u@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
they used the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it uses even the same lamps of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodrig@@ u@@ ez said he wanted to experiment with experiment .
he made new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wich@@ es are with bacon and cheese and sh@@ rim@@ ps like cap@@ ers and s@@ auté onions .
there is Natur@@ al@@ iss@@ sch@@ üssel@@ n .
the café offers no beer more , there is fresh juice .
after nine months Rodrig@@ u@@ ez announced that he noticed a st@@ alled power of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by the Willi@@ am@@ sburg prizes , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a client .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and regularly visited the Ver@@ b .
even after green@@ point she was drawn to green@@ point , she would take the way up .
after the Ver@@ b was closed , she gave her coffee to a while , she said .
&quot; I became clear that it was in the coffee and on the culture of the Ver@@ b , who liked me , &quot; she said .
now she drinks coffee again , even if they put another I@@ ced coffee on this day instead of the usual I@@ ced Tea Party , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ time customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and stood in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably forever .
&quot; I came home to seven days , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing b@@ ag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodrig@@ u@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and try new ingredients to the menu .
today , Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodrig@@ u@@ ez said he was not a l@@ ll of it , that the soap in the old business room has taken .
the owner of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie actually asked to make a special soap for use with the cold used coffee of the caf@@ es as an ingre@@ dient .
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; Rodrig@@ u@@ ez said .
and the traditional , Polish citizens of Green@@ points have also accepted the café also .
a new customer interpre@@ ted the menu of Polish and Rodrig@@ u@@ ez said he said he will soon exhibit her new neighbo@@ urs .
the location also has further advantages .
a local Saf@@ et@@ est would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ fired coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a back shop .
a new raff@@ le is sufficient for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground , when the café lock .
when the new caf@@ e opened , Wh@@ itt told that the opening of the location and the fin@@ als felt a new coffee as hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , after his ascent to the President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt was a Fa@@ ible for hat@@ ched del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen of Fif@@ th Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water@@ sch@@ ild@@ kr@@ ö@@ ten@@ ure .
his menu on that day was a hum@@ ble : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um @-@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans that should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while Z@@ iegel@@ man tells her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food spec@@ tra .
your newest cooperation , &quot; A continuous meal , &quot; will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great De@@ pression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for supp@@ er , a small , sn@@ oo@@ ped I@@ mb@@ iss in the Flat@@ iron District , which is already in the store since the stock of bor@@ der@@ r@@ ash in 1929 .
Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh slice with olive oil , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable bread .
when the re@@ porter rose h@@ ack@@ les , this found the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of Great De@@ pression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver lo@@ af and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingre@@ dient and some budget prepared by the ingre@@ dient .
imagine so many earth@@ en@@ ings to eat that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ e gr@@ inst@@ e .
&quot; it must have put up like lead in the stomach like lead . &quot;
in the years before the Great De@@ pression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
the teams of women co@@ iled for male soldiers and it was served fresh baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; was the Americans that sent to star@@ fish during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the paths that the country round with it is no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ en@@ land .
&quot; it was a time in eating for the Americans that was a central theme , &quot; gif@@ ted co@@ e , why he and his wife wants to write about it .
just as ten@@ se it was the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ ff : m@@ yst@@ ical food like lo@@ aves and k@@ asser@@ ol@@ len were used to basic nutr@@ itious food , the c@@ asser@@ ole itself as &quot; wonderful way , eating coat h@@ ats , because they could hide un@@ app@@ et@@ ite ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry ob@@ st .
meat , the years of the middle of American cuisine , was a rarely preserved luxury .
strange mix@@ tures were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ oriented and nour@@ ished satis@@ faction had a taste or even healthy dishes .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes prepared , bricks made a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not any supplement at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues out : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions are not fit in each other .
it was typical for many of the care recipes .
as never before or since then , bud@@ ger@@ ies budget - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the hab@@ its hab@@ its of the country ab@@ rupt@@ ly .
by applying the recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encour@@ aged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary issues &quot; and the challenge , sp@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic L@@ ands .
in particular , the opinions about the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me cake food yoga position .
while he publicly tra@@ ded the simple I@@ owa farmer house in his kitchen , he special@@ ties like the billi@@ on@@ ful man of world , to whom he has become .
&quot; he liked the tin@@ ent kitchen like a fish with cu@@ c@@ umber &quot; , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in a almost g@@ ild@@ ed food room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful to reality .
perhaps President Roosevelt would perhaps have taken the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called to stat@@ ute him with his stomach .
as described in the book , with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Roosevelt , the White House presented the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most difficult meal prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great De@@ pression , handled with food , was rejected when the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Z@@ iegel@@ man , as well as science was applied to food .
the couple was given to the writing of the book the eating hab@@ its of smel@@ ter &apos;s mother in law , - for example how they couldn &apos;t throw away foods .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
Z@@ iegel@@ man remember@@ ed : &quot; they really made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind de@@ capit@@ ol .
after the plate of Eis@@ enberg &apos;s ev@@ acu@@ ated , she moved to Co@@ e a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums did eat Roosevelt .
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Wh@@ ip , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick to miss a nice name .
there was no cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone de@@ af somewhat un@@ will@@ ingly , a spo@@ on in the f@@ ow@@ ing , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
surpris@@ ingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
Co@@ E reco@@ vers three times a supplement .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed by bom@@ bs : he was the hero of Ale@@ pp@@ o
he put his own life to help others to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ pp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Omar is devoted to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives of life .
now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself is dead with a Fass@@ bom@@ b attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a Civil Protection , who saved some 6@@ 0,000 people in life so far .
2900 volunteers put their own life to move people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid in the war .
they are the her@@ oes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of a Civil Guard , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the dec@@ ay of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans for a shining symbo@@ lic figure in the hor@@ ror of war .
as a hero , he has never seen himself , said : &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; if I die to save lives , I think that God looks in me a mart@@ yr@@ s . &quot;
just before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the hel@@ icop@@ ters have rejected four fac@@ bom@@ bs over the E@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as .
a wife and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; we elim@@ inate the poison@@ ous over time of the bom@@ b so that no children are playing , &quot; the image cited his last words before he died .
the dead@@ ly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest sp@@ ine is almost 400 years old
more rare sight .
Greenland we usually come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and im@@ paired with a 1 km / h due to the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland know only with 150 years of offspring .
the Grön@@ land shar@@ ks on the bottom of the North Atlantic matches the reason of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour he is coming on average just 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes down , the five meter long Tier is acceler@@ ating to at least 2,6 km / h - and this top speed is half as quickly as Rob@@ be .
this lon@@ el@@ iness pro@@ claimed lifestyle but seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported on a journal &quot; Science &quot; at any time from a Greenland , the 392 years .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sche@@ uer@@ lein was comm@@ ented by the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for Dem@@ graphic Research in Rostock , this means a world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
while the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tionary bi@@ ologist probably had long been to be st@@ ressed by the company .
only the evidence was lack@@ ing .
Greenland are hard to watch , eventually they live mainly in the Eis@@ meer in front of the spar@@ sely pop@@ ulated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because it is water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter .
in correspon@@ d@@ ingly , the researchers know a little about the lifestyle of the Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie .
their time pent@@ at@@ rac@@ ers they throw six animals with a broad@@ c@@ aster in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
lo@@ ot said these shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal resear@@ cher , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had sw@@ allowed the bone bone of a young polar bears .
maybe they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the Eis@@ me@@ er and seek@@ s Kad@@ aver , which tor@@ ates from higher water layers down@@ ward .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues did now study 28 Greenland , fisher@@ men between 2010 and 2013 prior to Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard from the dep@@ ths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 inches long , while the largest 502 cen@@ timeter measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method called the lens of the shar@@ ks .
this centre of eyel@@ ids ar@@ ises before the birth of the shar@@ ks which might not be renewed in ther@@ ein after the birth of the shar@@ ks .
the two smallest shar@@ ks were stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
therefore , your birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , to determine major quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
with its 220 cen@@ timet@@ ers in length , the lens held a low sur@@ plus at carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapon , it might have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Grön@@ land ha@@ ie in their lens had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cos@@ mic ray in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 Clock was supposed to have had an age of 335 years for a 493 cen@@ timet@@ res , while the record shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ timet@@ ers would be 392 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters .
now the researchers have to as@@ sign a age to age .
since one of the animals with 392 cen@@ timet@@ ers would probably stand at the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature and his age at 156 years has become evi@@ dent in the multip@@ lic@@ ation of the multip@@ lic@@ ation obviously at least a half centuries time .
this might be the world record for ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates .
there is no co@@ incidence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ema occur above all in the icy waters .
even the previous record holder , an 211 years old Grön@@ land w@@ al , in whose bacon over a 120 year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught by Alaska .
due to its low temperatures , the organ@@ ism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ ity .
they are ri@@ pe later - and s@@ lows s@@ lower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , animals are often particularly large .
the volume grows much quick@@ er than its surface , through which the animal heat has recovered .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is much greater than using a gram ph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a small be@@ ast therefore lives in so dangerous and should be concentrated as many offspring as possible , &quot; explains the E@@ vol@@ u@@ tionary bi@@ ologist Sche@@ uer@@ lein .
a very big be@@ ast should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building ground in double pack
on the topic of the building in the recent session , the council aims at its recent session .
with relief , the Panel Survey carried out the notification of may@@ or Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of recent residential building can begin . &quot;
after the plot , investment and event inqu@@ iries could be clar@@ ified , and the applications for measuring have been proved , stands the sale of plots in the residential areas of &quot; road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section of Bin@@ der@@ strasse - extension section 1 ) of interested parties .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
according to the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city is best opportunities to draw jobs and companies from London .
&quot; it &apos;s very likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Department of Excellence and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether funds will continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU .
the so @-@ called EU Pass will provide approval to them in the UK so far .
they just use great US banks .
several banks have already announced to develop jobs .
lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; is living with 10000 new jobs in the Main and five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , responsible for monetary policy and supervision over the biggest banks of the Eurozone , as well as another important authorities as the European insurance policy ( EI@@ O@@ PA ) and Risk Committee ES@@ RB .
indeed in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the public is important for banks as it can commun@@ icate so directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
Luxembourg shel@@ ters a large f@@ are@@ well industry , but snow as well as Dublin in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt may be much easier to reach thanks to the great airport .
the city also covers the town with a slightly available commercial property .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free practice rooms , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
in addition to the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial property is 50 percent higher than the main one .
Frankfurt also offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical supplies and infrastructure and lower crime .
in a ranking of the Management Consult@@ ation Mer@@ cer Group &apos;s ranking stands on place seven , Luxembourg on place 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
even if the quality of life is a question of prefer@@ ences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could market further banks and investors , &quot; follow the I@@ W .
but London , however , will remain the most important financial center in Europe , despite all the most important financial center in Europe .
therefore , the relationship of forces : in London worked at the end of 2015 according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead &apos;s land receives funding from he@@ pat@@ itis C Pat@@ ent@@ ru@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a US authorities decided that Gilead sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the rights that you emerged from the he@@ pat@@ itis C legal disp@@ ute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was fre@@ ed from a damages deposit of $ 200 million for the viol@@ ation of two pat@@ ents &quot; pat@@ ents &quot; by Mer@@ ck , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medic@@ ations S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , having covered a pattern of patches with flaws , including the party of opinion and other un@@ eth@@ ical actions .
in the complaint filed by the complaint on Thursday , US Ambassador Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman told that Gilead &apos;s claim to reduce costs , which were created during the defense of the F@@ all .
Mer@@ ck tries to restri@@ ct Gilead to the market of a new generation of he@@ pat@@ itis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck collabor@@ ated on each other def@@ end@@ ants and property on laboratory work , with sof@@ os@@ bu@@ v@@ ir under@@ lying around the active ingre@@ dient in the medic@@ ations of Gilead .

Clin@@ tons earn at 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 , pay 34,@@ 2 % of the federal government
Hill@@ ary Clinton , on Friday , published their tax return for 2015 , the Democrats , and her husband , a revenue of USD 10.@@ 75 million , and an effective regul@@ atory tax rate of 34,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 the Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton achieved a income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for their book on their ministry for their ministry within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine , Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax ex@@ plan@@ ations from the past ten years .
they paid a pre @-@ effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; served Clinton &apos;s Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ in Jenn@@ ifer Palm@@ ieri in a position .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hidden behind incor@@ rec@@ t ex@@ e@@ tion and re@@ trac@@ ers in terms of its previous promises to publish his tax ex@@ plan@@ ations .
it is usual for US pre@@ sidential statements to publish their tax ex@@ plan@@ ations , although they are not oblig@@ ed to have the law because of the law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York busin@@ ess@@ man , and his lawyers as a tax test conducted by tax authorities as a reason .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s electoral campaign in Ian SA@@ MS on Twitter in regards to the release of the Pre@@ sidential elections .
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor to CN@@ N says that he would not allow not to publish anything before the control tests are not finished .
Tr@@ ump cr@@ itic , among others also the re@@ publi@@ can candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already re@@ plac@@ able that his ref@@ us@@ al questions re@@ ject his donations to char@@ itable organisations , its business and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton already fre@@ ed on the subject and on Friday a video on the Internet is published in the Re@@ verse Re@@ public@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
she spoke the issue on Thursday during a talk to the economy of Mich@@ igan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other pre@@ sidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax ex@@ plan@@ ations . &quot;
POLI@@ TI@@ CO reported that Tr@@ ump does not paid only a few years during the 1990s for two years , and an econom@@ ist journalist for the New York Times quot@@ ed a number of tax @-@ forests and tax advis@@ ors , the information that still could be the case .
federal fund has become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regime that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and invest@@ or War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would make sure that people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a electoral campaign of Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Ne@@ bras@@ ka called a Buff@@ ett , whose Berk@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate here has his seat , Tr@@ ump to show their tax ex@@ plan@@ ations .
Buff@@ ett said he has been sub@@ jected to a control test of IR@@ S and ump , &quot; fear &quot; in the vot@@ ers and not before the tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published fiscal policy dates back to 2007 .
the Clinton , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , live on average an effective regul@@ atory tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that only USD 100 will be referred to as a reward , differ@@ ently than the majority of all Americans .
its main funding situation was an in@@ expensive index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ d@@ ends and income from USD 109@@ .000 .

Jewish director construc@@ ts Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli international pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT news
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing a media up after he betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli public selection since it would have requested &quot; Arab guests according to a employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Doc@@ umentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
what is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new German , so that Israel elim@@ in@@ ates and er@@ ased ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a possibility to call Israel over an own call center .
after a declaration on the director , the director turned to the front desk .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him as Lanz@@ mann .
the hotel stated that the measure has been a &quot; deli@@ ber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; decision .
the reason , who stood behind , in the director was still more anger .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have requested that the election is clear , &quot; the employee was quot@@ ed by Lanz@@ mann .
the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Had@@ as @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were de@@ composed and am@@ ended by this event .
this is really very embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusion , &quot; said the car@@ riers .
the inc@@ ident dissolved a pretty big response in the Internet , where people burned it a sc@@ andal .
some were in the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have looked after the alle@@ ged invol@@ vement of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be ash@@ amed to be pointed out in another article that the hotel that is located at the n@@ asty Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , located near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly rejected all the acc@@ us@@ ations of themselves and called &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement . &quot; Israel does not take to include in the quick list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quot@@ ed a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds to the country code now has been added .

trading between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rising to 71 % - RT Business
according to the Russian amb@@ assador in Iran , Le@@ van D@@ z@@ hag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teh@@ er@@ an , an increase of 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions im@@ posed on Iran , interest in a Russian company grew strongly in the country , distributed in amb@@ assador .
Russian company will take existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
naturally , the further administrative building is one of the biggest pri@@ or@@ ities of the bil@@ ateral Cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ hag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran fell by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and fell $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade advance sw@@ ing@@ ing was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ assador .
D@@ z@@ hag@@ ar@@ yan plans to record a record number of Iran@@ ian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian exp@@ ense climbed around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily of travel to Iran@@ ian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in Russia , leading the tourist numbers in Russia .
you might say that the record numbers of Iran@@ ian tourists will be broken from last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Rus@@ sians are visiting Iran , something , ho@@ ping for amb@@ assador to change it .
&quot; I personally recommend the visit to the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Per@@ sian c@@ ivil@@ ization in a good condition . &quot;

Scot@@ um Sk@@ inner storm@@ s home to home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory , when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor for his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend fier@@ ce , as he had storm@@ ed back home to a victory of the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking win during Ho@@ y the fifth of six Olympics .
they repe@@ aled the trick that in March at the World Championships in London , despite the section Ho@@ ys only a mod@@ est sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton was tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man who remained on her when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that turned away now .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won over four years ago with Ho@@ y tri@@ umph@@ al - and Sk@@ inner were launched in the qualifying rounds , but the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the New Zealand on the first round .
and the British trio took the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des was short back after his round , but Kenn@@ y brought it to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategic shift made a major part of transformation , in which he drove in a higher speed to slow it down and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner allows to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert from and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , than they rose on the podium .
the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name .
we found the Olympic Games in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the world champion .
it was just un@@ belie@@ vable .
there is no better ways to win .
after the Triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys he gave me to the path that he fell to a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no ob@@ jection of England ri@@ vals .
in such a superior victory there was no such problem for this time .
he said : &quot; it feels like London that we flags over the whole UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we came so bad@@ ly at so many world records that it was un@@ belie@@ vable again to win the Olympics .
this is an event that won a gold medal for the nation , which won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if that a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months is that we expect a successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ ys it &apos;s possible to repeat the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - that was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23rd March ( an apparently holy date for the British sports ; on the day Steve G@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister ) were born - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cas@@ ings of Ho@@ y equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old son Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something to be able to gain alone .
he said , &quot; When he wins two gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only Medal competition of the day , but there were another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dy W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 at the destination .
the world record , which won in London in 2012 , lay at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at the W@@ ig@@ ail with security in focus .
he had cont@@ ested yesterday with orders in the qualification , as the offici@@ als saw him to measure his body size .
in the speaking women &apos;s competition , the morning continued and finished , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ el Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Arch@@ ib@@ ald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie , world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is going to be on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a shot of medals .
following a ver@@ ily unusual representation of absolute Domin@@ anz in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio has been shut down .
it &apos;s also played in the background , as the back@@ pedal of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April am@@ id@@ st by S@@ ut@@ mus@@ - and Mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ ent as well as reti@@ rement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks very well , the well @-@ legendary reputation GB@@ s , which at a perfect moment , has been reached again .
future of the closing of Portland due to re@@ voc@@ ation of the Energy Agreement
the future of aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as a lot of work@@ places of workers - standing on the game , as the asset operator will cancel the energy supply contract and thereby distributed all supply contracts , as supplied by energy companies .
this step followed the decision by the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is scheduled to run in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Alco@@ a in Portland are located on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and in@@ direct - could be at a closing time .
moreover , it could occur too Domin@@ o@@ Effects , as the melt grow around 10 per cent of the total electricity production of Victor@@ ias .
in 2014 , Alco@@ a joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led the last year to a closure of the An@@ gles@@ ea power station .
the closing of Alco@@ a in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closing .
this step follows the lon@@ gl@@ ary spec@@ ulations in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the power price for the installation .
AG@@ L , which is sup@@ plying the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Yang A plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , it announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility occup@@ ies a joint venture of Alco@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p kept smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L passes away that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , meaning another physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; the company shared the company .
AG@@ L continued to continue supporting the so @-@ called &quot; securing transactions &quot; which should have been in force from November 2016 onwards .
the contracts have a 12 month subscription period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L ass@@ umes that the contracts for the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; said the electricity supplier .
all potential imp@@ acts on AG@@ L from the GJ 18 are currently restricted by the forec@@ asts of strong current markets for major Commercial prices .
AG@@ L announced that it already issued the value of the contracts in its annual amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the contracts with the ability of Alco@@ as ... to guarantee the melt or the power supply to the melt &quot; not im@@ paired .
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still a explanation , why it came from the contract .
an@@ alyst@@ s war@@ n from the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closing of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of week , the head of Oper@@ ations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland annual electricity of 600 Meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago will consume about 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts .
if both plants van@@ ish from the market , it would mean considerable decrease in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; .
and for us as a gener@@ ators that would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a card@@ ash@@ ian reality TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all on the cover of the Se@@ pt@@ ember@@ er edition of the Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the card@@ ash@@ ian @-@ j@@ enner cl@@ ans Kri@@ s is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Se@@ pt@@ ember@@ er edition of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der , and at the Fashion Weeks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday &apos;s news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to the we@@ a , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the re@@ vel@@ ist of the Co@@ vers followed a b@@ iz@@ arre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kard@@ ash@@ ians ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as the whole &apos;s most popular Show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as they have completed the cover of their sister and with a classic turn : they all have a surprise attack .
this un@@ th@@ ru@@ ined action happened virtually every birthday party , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with hon@@ esty of cartoon animation on a radio square at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) but Kri@@ s had to leave her other ma@@ iden somehow with this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kard@@ ash@@ ians began .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s great sister Kim may she , what the Vog@@ ue cover is endor@@ sed ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West had been shown on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September magazine is a le@@ ague .
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue most mostly the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference which resem@@ bles a photo collection as a fashion journal , the issue holds a large number of win@@ dings ( L@@ oud F@@ ashion@@ ista ) from 8@@ 32 pages of the artist ( 615 pages advertising ) .
the re@@ velation of his cover stars is predic@@ ted that in the past two years the journal is still se@@ ep@@ ed before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were definitely more &quot; famous gre@@ ens &quot; models , &quot; models and famous models are on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand amb@@ assador Jenn@@ ifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at low chance that Ms. J@@ enner - is described by the magazine as the &quot; break@@ through model &quot; from their generation - below the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or teen@@ agers from today to know how to flip a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all of them sw@@ if@@ ter ) .
they are really tal@@ ented women that record in the entertainment industry .

Municipal R@@ iding centres propos@@ es 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 customers of the country have rejected each year by the N@@ R@@ iding centres annually , while the industry imp@@ acted on the impact of further mean l@@ ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land already three of five people - mostly older people , immig@@ rants , helpful people , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ og@@ ations and similar problems - with their attempt on free legal advice and legal services .
legal services of the church , which are already exc@@ essi@@ v@@ ely familiar , are ready for further cuts .
as of June the next year it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their funds .
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell , said that the last survey of the National Association of Sh@@ ape R@@ iding , revealed that thousands of people have rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land leg@@ umes are subject to chron@@ ically under@@ taken , causing thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave the viol@@ ent relationship , people with un@@ ob@@ vi@@ able and impressive deb@@ ts , families who have been dis@@ missed by divi@@ d@@ ations - all these people have problems in legal way that you can &apos;t get the help you need .
the federal government will continue to shor@@ ten by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of hil@@ need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to just@@ ify any problem with their legal problems .
we demand the Federal Government and the Federal Minister of Defence and Central Affairs of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to with@@ draw these middle distances , so that people need help to get them out of legal problems .
last year , the state government stu@@ ffed its commitment to the national average for right @-@ handed ring .
it is now at the time to see the needs of the Municipal R@@ iding Cent@@ res and its customer research as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k will be invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey Survey in front of the countries : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming pol@@ ls in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U are recorded .
this resulted in representative of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while red @-@ black co@@ alition government could continue to rain in the north , it is not possible after the circumstances in Berlin .
in both federal states the SPD would have been the strongest party and would have a good chance to set the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collap@@ sed on 24 percent five years ago .
according to survey , the party only appears just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the Left and the Af@@ d .
the left would be 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ d would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
the Gre@@ ens had a slight losses of 6 percent ( before 8.7 percent ) again in the heavy coun@@ sel@@ ing day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the Parliament each with 3 percent .
according to the Bundestag election , the SPD in the survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 per cent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still standing behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ d would represent 14 percent for the first time in the de@@ pu@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return the pir@@ ates would miss the one in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
T @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator came to the market 20 years ago .
the world &apos;s success@@ ors are domin@@ ating the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ ck .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ f@@ ies with high resolution .
there is now an iPhone has been delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers of the devices can still be purchased on the Internet , but they somehow come from the rock age of the internet .
for 20 years ago , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sens@@ ation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at C@@ eb@@ it &apos; Computer@@ messe C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as a &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ ity format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also by fax was the Commun@@ ic@@ ator .
even access to websites was possible by HTML browser , if too slow .
a calcul@@ ator is available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the cell phone could be en@@ rolled like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and black @-@ white screen found themselves .
pretty proud was the prize : 2700 D @-@ Mark , therefore about 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was € 392 million .
no one could believe in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of Fin@@ ns experienced an un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and wrapped .
today , the market domin@@ ates that all of them came as Nokia .
and everywhere and everywhere , this is daily for many people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices on Samsung and Apple , some 555 million copies were produced .
global sales with the units raised to around 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ running business of count@@ less app vend@@ ors and t@@ elec@@ ommun@@ ications companies come .
around the smartphone has grown a whole industry .
the decisive break@@ through to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple Chef Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Phones .
he spoke three units in one : a music player , a telephone and a Internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use .
the tri@@ umph@@ al march of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
we now have Apple and Asian vend@@ ors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ understanding for 20 years after his invention .
on average , every German has now 88 times a day on its mobile phone .
&quot; we need to learn all , the Smartphone , &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in charge of staff for staff .
permanent availability is now regarded as cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only be in our local commun@@ es and throughout London , but in the whole country , and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we used a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from playing .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we are alone to create 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
I told me that England will never be ready for games , and that we will be able to bl@@ am@@ ate us on the world stage .
the dou@@ b@@ ers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obst@@ acles to detect , but He@@ ath@@ row answered any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn of growing growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole GB .
we have completed a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has carried out a £ 11 bn of your infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T5 - five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport switches , was built up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented run@@ way around the world .
now it is ready to supply a third running bridge , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investments .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am conf@@ ident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row , as well as our future trade , and create a legacy of skills and employment , to be proud of the United Kingdom .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; on display papers
for companies that make money with online advertising come , according to one of the software &apos;s efforts to circum@@ vent , &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad lo@@ aves on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus , in which it announced that users could block their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the encoding in regards to its advertis@@ ements in order to detect the ad @-@ lo@@ oting , which part of the page advertising is to be recognized .
but Ad@@ block told that it has found a new way to handle new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ mail the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ und @-@ Her @-@ fight between the an@@ ze@@ i@@ geb@@ ra@@ izing Open Source Community and the ren@@ der@@ ers have already been possible , so it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest media in the fight has left the fight , is a strong indi@@ z to become as@@ le@@ aking as@@ le@@ aking optim@@ isation for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people have fun @-@ block@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion a daily active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , is power@@ less than 84 percent of the plant &apos;s fac@@ eboo@@ ks .
the company has seen it on display man@@ ders on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ eboo@@ ks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared an speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs make a sufficient large proportion of income , so Facebook appears to be a worth@@ while .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad @-@ pre@@ h@@ d@@ tool &quot; to have more control on target@@ ed advertising .
on Thursday Facebook announced that Ad@@ blocks new filter could be org@@ ue because it would also block content on the page which are no advertising .
&quot; for the User , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to arrange the issue , &quot; shared speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message .
display man@@ ders are a bl@@ unt means why we have concentrated on developers like Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control in the hands of the people .
woman susp@@ ected su@@ icide on Swiss motorway
the victims was in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police calls us after a woman in the early hours of morning on Thursday at a susp@@ ected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the inc@@ ident occurred on the A1 close to Morges in the canton of Wa@@ adt shortly after midnight .
one woman laid in the dark &quot; in an act of des@@ pair . &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police in V@@ aud said .
it is obvious that there was a p@@ est@@ erin at the age of 49 , which was driven by several vehicles including a truck that was wanted to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been destroyed , but some are still not identified , said the police who , as well as any witnesses of the fore@@ word , to report .
it was an investig@@ ator opened what a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the driver will be shown .
was a c@@ lash avoid@@ able ?
that is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; did court st@@ etter .
two other cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be pulled for responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person running on the free@@ way - was decided that the drivers did not need to take out that a pe@@ de@@ strian walk in the middle on the free@@ way as it was in the newspaper .
last year a police officer acqu@@ itted when she had acqu@@ itted a man who had killed one man who died in August 2014 a night on the A1 close to Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had dr@@ unk and has become conscious of the street , tried the court .
the court noted that the polic@@ eman had answered in a reasonable way -- and that the presence of a man held a &quot; perfectly extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
everyone who has further information about the case on Thursday near Morges , should report with the number 021 6@@ 44 83 46 or 021 6@@ 44 44 44 .
naked climate control : Venus was once more hab@@ itable
according to projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model , Venus was once more hab@@ itable .
scientists at the God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms , similar to those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have proven with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously shown that the slow revol@@ utions of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere , and nevertheless slowly turned on .
the model also lit the topo@@ graphy of the early Venus .
planet pointed out more dry areas than de earth , but had once enough water and geograph@@ ic vari@@ ability to shel@@ tering life and protected from high ap@@ or@@ ic .
the early Venus was also benef@@ ited from a Sun which was a matter of 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus run their daily side of the sun almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produced rain which creates a thick layer of clouds which looks like a umbrella on the surface of a large part of the sun .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than the Earth today are .
the model brought a story of the Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that had been suggested by planetary investig@@ ations .
although probably it was pres@@ umed , Venus was exposed to many heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of the years .
her oc@@ eans has ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was fired from ultra@@ violet light .
as you cir@@ cling only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide , with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers share the results of their new Venus Climate Impact in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the Aval@@ an@@ che coach
Patrick Roy went back on Thursday as a train@@ ee and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and lead to a minor mit@@ igation matters .
alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have filled my duties as Princip@@ al trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and ren@@ ew@@ y , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
I have long and thought about it during the summer , how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give it a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Oper@@ ations need to be perfectly adapted to the organization .
he must also have a determination of certain decisions that affect the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic who had to@@ red his to@@ wing on 23 May 2013 , for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick today informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
in his debut season , Roy received the best coach of the League in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the association to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed in any of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches in the 2015 @-@ 16 season took a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference around five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ice öl@@ ers take up discussions on , put strikes out
the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation regarding the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for North Sea Mer@@ ge will be suspended , while all the parties are put on a new round table to the table , said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the Wood @-@ service provider Wood Group , spor@@ adi@@ c was run on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and Un@@ its unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ start the processing of current stre@@ ites , &quot; says it in a joint statement .
we will hold some full day meetings in the coming weeks which will begin next year to re@@ start the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in more than 25 years , a protest against possible wage short@@ cuts by up to 30 percent .
in this year Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts are available to the company needed to come through the market launch .
shell is released for its part of thousands of people and plans to ad@@ mit his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alised with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are due to the lower cru@@ de oil prices under pressure , an economical situation that forced to leave the European Union by decision of the British in June .
the Scottish parliamentary committee Dave Anderson met with workers at the beginning of this week , in order to discuss one of the biggest job lit@@ igation since a generation in the North Sea .
North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion spending will be expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ traum@@ teles@@ cope has helped to collect the most complete catalog of Rot@@ ation rates under the stars of the star@@ ry .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating at different rati@@ os as well as in which context the Rot@@ ation hab@@ it@@ ats are standing with the planet .
&quot; we hope that we learn through the compar@@ is@@ ons of our results with other star@@ ry , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his Sunday system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star says of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies about 445 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star@@ ry were originated approximately 125 million years ago , reaching the ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood .
they turn on the fastest .
at peak rotation , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars are pus@@ hing great amounts of star@@ winds .
since this winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a ret@@ inal effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , his rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of every star by taking the time between the appear of a not@@ able Stern@@ en@@ fle@@ cks -- as sun spots - det@@ ects .
the latest catalogue of rotation speed indicates that massive star s@@ lows are s@@ lower than less solid stars .
Reb@@ ull is like the stars with danc@@ ers , whereby larger stars s@@ lower ste@@ es are turning as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster presses tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the star says of the P@@ lei@@ ades so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ mic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates .
&quot; the star@@ ry of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and el@@ derly , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
it is still a lot of us to learn about how the How , When and Why Stars conf@@ id@@ ently slow down their rotation att@@ itudes and s@@ wear their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
reb@@ ull and her colleagues in three newspaper reports reported in detail about their latest analysis of the v@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .

the national association accept the matter &quot; very seriously and requested by Chen rich co @-@ operation with the investig@@ ations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we are going to cooper@@ ate with the International Sports Court in CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly in positive cases .
also in the night of Rio se@@ ep the news about the positive sample of Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old thus went on the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
it was innocent , &quot; the only ex@@ plan@@ ations could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the light athle@@ tics .
according to report , it is said to act with the associated substance for the blood g@@ ing@@ ent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended interim , according to B@@ NT the B trial should also be positive .
Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w not@@ ably gro@@ unded with criticism in the athl@@ ete &apos;s language .
&quot; I don &apos;t get that the athletes defeat the right loops , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulgaria stand under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
it is not permitted to take all weight lif@@ ter from the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ res@@ ist nation in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &apos; was also known as the London Olympics as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both cont@@ ests , however , they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa &apos;s case is a further heavy blow to the excell@@ ency of the whole sports .
the World association IAAF had prohibited the complete Russian team until an exception because of system@@ atic bus@@ hings , also the L@@ äu@@ haus Kenya has also been producing numerous bad news .
in the swimming sport , the former tra@@ il@@ ings in China had caused a great conflict between athletes .
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t grab@@ bed the Chinese Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger Sun Yang in .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to sur@@ render myself , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio .
Sun rose in the centre of a meditation on the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping @-@ Bet@@ rü@@ ger &quot; said this .
Sun was a positive effect on the Chinese championships for stim@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ az@@ id@@ in in 2014 , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
hum@@ p : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ack@@ ers your sol@@ dering money
programmer of black@@ mail malware is currently target@@ ed target@@ ed companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey on malware Defense Special@@ ist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies have been at least once , some hundreds of victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies have already achieved target of a Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims were willing to re@@ strain the li@@ vest@@ ock , in order to re@@ use the challeng@@ ed systems and data .
the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors special@@ ize their black@@ mail software according to ob@@ serv@@ ations from Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes gradually on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potenti@@ ally anticip@@ ated sol@@ dering money will significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; we watch currently a ter@@ rif@@ ying fast evolution of the malware software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Marc@@ in Kle@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the firmware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors released software for itself .
only there were private users the target , but the change to company attacks were sc@@ ary quickly in recent months .
Ran@@ om@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , they search for un@@ long changed files like Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives from pictures and videos .
these files en@@ code the Ran@@ k@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the end code @-@ code to the files , the victims must pay money - usually in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users can use the personal photo database on the game , it is set up with companies for sensitive customers or project databases without shut down production .
consequently , the damage ar@@ ises when a Ran@@ som@@ ware ass@@ umes .
22 percent of all affected German companies en@@ de@@ generated sales losses in Ran@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to break up business activity , in case of a case people were killed in life situations .
in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of ac@@ ute ac@@ utely end@@ ang@@ ered .
&quot; we always say the sacrif@@ ices : pays not , it promotes only the problem , &quot; explains Kle@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
yet , 80 to 90 percent of companies estimated to pay back their data .
for managers it is difficult to re@@ ject the demand of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors in view of a stand@@ still .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a current study the security resear@@ cher from F @-@ Secure needs to explo@@ de the user &apos;s users and get in touch with the results : the per@@ pet@@ ers actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain their sacrif@@ ices via chat , as you can pay by Bit@@ coin , upgrade freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and will priv@@ ately dis@@ solve payments of a few hundred euros , companies must act hard to negoti@@ ate and get five @-@ digit sum@@ mers to un@@ lock their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potenti@@ ally high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ om@@ ware @-@ Er@@ press@@ ors , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explained security experts from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write about a single person within a week . &quot;
likely , it is likely that it is about three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their editing software then in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
the existing malware kits produced by the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 Dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is a twe@@ eter system that can be changed smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and br@@ anding , &quot; Wis@@ nie@@ wski says .
the black@@ mail then seek@@ s more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you are log@@ ged in one of the for@@ ums in the underground , buying the set from a crime , and carry another to install the software on as many computers .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; the cri@@ min@@ als are assigned a sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
meanwhile , the risk of Ran@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the firms in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Survey trust that Ran@@ om@@ ware can with@@ draw using a file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors have already pursu@@ e new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have adequate threat to successful ex@@ pressing , instead the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors such as client lists or price calcul@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Marc@@ in Kle@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means damage potential depending on the type of data still a multiple higher than before .
the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors also could take totally new goals on the internet of things to grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con , it demonstr@@ ates how they were able to control a thermost@@ at under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the le@@ vel@@ ing of such a type block so many victims could be a rans@@ om .
if the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors , instead of the heating in the future will block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ om@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
in the little HR @-@ V I want to pack a little SUV : a little SUV , a bit of cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ at@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , is actually quite flexible in everyday life .
although the 1,60 m he@@ ighted HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the first row , it seems at no place close .
the interior materials of the interior are well finished and pleas@@ antly , only the cockpit top@@ side down there is something .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
there is not only a boot space of 453 l , provided with high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l on the folded back arm@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
that is less magic when it sounds : the bench bo@@ ilers can be up@@ loaded like chin @-@ up and provide storage space from the ground up to the ceiling 1,@@ 24 m high .
the luggage space is well @-@ loaded , however , the loading height with 650 mm is higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of ranges .
he might want to teach his work something qui@@ eter .
pleas@@ ing to the daily consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km .
another engine is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the behavior is balanced , a good com@@ promise between dynam@@ ics and comfort .
the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment is in the tested Top version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes un@@ fulfilled .
the City emergency braking system belongs to the safety systems ( works by Tempo 32 ) , the col@@ lagen system and a trace b@@ assist .
the coll@@ ision war@@ ns sometimes , because he rated many obst@@ acles as &quot; her@@ e@@ ering objects . &quot;
the remote tas@@ assistant works very reliable .
and the smart Tem@@ po@@ ulator respon@@ ds to the traffic detection and thr@@ ottle when needed .
the full connectivity is available only for top @-@ performance : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two US@@ B- and a HDMI @-@ jack are available under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something up@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 2@@ 9000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel is fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline engine will receive 20,000 Euros , the diesel from 230@@ 00 Euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and daily car .
Air@@ line shall not be : Stur@@ z on air@@ flow bridge
an air@@ line is not liable for the over@@ throw of a passenger on the passenger passenger .
a liability is only conce@@ iv@@ able by dang@@ ers that are typical for aerial transport , ar@@ gu@@ ed by the Düsseldorf Hig@@ her Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the cl@@ man had broken a kne@@ ad for himself in the over@@ throw .
but the accident would have been able to happen everywhere - it is a common way of life so that the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for man .
disease : when paid the promot@@ er
sick vac@@ ation@@ ers get back money after their journey , if the cause of the disease is und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly in the hotel .
but that is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in this case , a family on the second day of their tur@@ tle was heavily ill on di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness puts back the vac@@ ation@@ er to a def@@ ective se@@ wage system , which allegedly poll@@ uted the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view that had been a lack of - and compl@@ ain@@ ted against the organ@@ izers .
before court , the car@@ riers had no success .
indeed the se@@ wage plant was def@@ ective .
but the organ@@ izer recently went out before leaving the car@@ riers .
until then he had to assume that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information issues , so that judgment .
generally in the samples of water no contam@@ ination were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps due to infection - belonged to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 of 691 guests .
according to the viol@@ ations of violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère took many people in need of further attacks in July .
the state must be discre@@ et and decided at the same time to terror@@ ists .
for sure , our country will not answer the violence of the per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors with hat@@ red and split .
this tri@@ umph will not strengthen the terror@@ ists .
if off@@ ended faster , the country would have to leave , but the safety , and the consent of the population for refuge@@ e policy .
de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag ( 2017 ) .
he also announced another person@@ alized gain of security forces , namely in the medium @-@ four @-@ digit order for several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y for terror@@ ism must be pun@@ ished .
video surveillance is improved , that ce@@ ase@@ fire is so no@@ vel@@ ed that mainly the purchase of weapons in the internet is worth .
the least @-@ mentioned in@@ jur@@ ies to physi@@ ci@@ ans should remain weigh@@ ted according to de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ères of words .
however , in dialogue with the medical juice we want to seek solutions such as the compan@@ ions of citizens can be decreased , he said with sight around psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities .
to op@@ pose a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister has a better social support for necess@@ ity .
teachers need to be prepared better in dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the persec@@ ution of cri@@ min@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère plan the deployment of hidden investig@@ ator .
the SPD head Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contribute to enhance safety . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister made clear to action .
&quot; this was a Ear@@ rings for the Shar@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspaper of the Fun@@ c@@ et media group ( Friday ) .
on the Union de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ère , calls from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double citi@@ zen@@ ship ever rejected .
he is a general prohib@@ ition of full deter@@ ior@@ ating it for const@@ itu@@ tionally proble@@ matic .
you can &apos;t offer anything , what you ref@@ uses and re@@ ject the l@@ ages of Bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about street traffic or witnesses in court .
green @-@ che@@ fin Simone Peter designed the minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ ter@@ ror attacks and action ability .

better traffic flow on the highway breeding
this is periodi@@ cally located on the roads , here a picture of November .
but that should change : the disp@@ ute split should be extended .
this is good news for all motor@@ cyclists who continue at the driving road on the ambient road every evening at St@@ au ( A 43 ) on the Highway ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 of August ) , provinc@@ ial road construction extends between the Hammer Road and the departure Wes@@ eler Street and the departure hall at 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then go right from Hammer Road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic is shared for an early time , whereby the total process is improved on the complex section of the Federal Rail@@ road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Church agency of Münster @-@ West .
the lift @-@ lane at the Zu@@ br@@ inger ner@@ v@@ t the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
at last , the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ es road and sometimes also goes beyond .
for this reason , the needle eye is shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler street .
from here the traffic will only be guided on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ constructed from a good one @-@ three years ago .
the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge doesn &apos;t have the required lifting force , especially to record the heavy duty transport .
like long this bott@@ len@@ eck and that meant it is still ad@@ her@@ ent , the permanent state enterprise can not say .
however , years old to count : for the bridge has an official maturity of up to 2034 .
for the extension of the legal framework , the country is deli@@ ber@@ ately picked up the traffic @-@ weak@@ ening time in school holidays , because we have dis@@ abilities for dis@@ abilities .
traffic will be on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site on Wednesday .
Inter@@ cultural Travel : Culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; Das invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are planning a musical project now .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows people to visit with immig@@ rant and refuge@@ e background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; The invisible building &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster .
in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ ates &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; we visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of st@@ aging in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents with mig@@ rant and refuge@@ e background to visit schools with welcome clients the opportunity to visit the cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the yo@@ ungst@@ ers of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria had come to Münster .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , the scenic images and video anim@@ ations it would have been possible to follow the action step though , so the press release of the boys The@@ aters Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Christ@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together during the upcoming season as part of a theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and mig@@ rant background between 14 and 20 years will receive the possibility to visit professional attack courses in the areas of singing , dance , sw@@ ings and music .
offer@@ ings for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical voice transmission are in the planning .
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; project goes further .
due to the increased refuge@@ e figures , the club with many classes , who want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ters : hope for weather change
the weather has fallen by the star sn@@ u@@ ff in southwest Germany in the night to Friday a break through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was not suitable because of clouds and rain , to observe the sky spect@@ acle , the chair@@ person of the ob@@ serv@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we will surely watch many stars of the sky .
the shooting stars is Per@@ se@@ ids , which belong to the fastest mon@@ ast@@ eries with 2@@ 16000 kilometres per hour .
they apparently have your name because they come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is occurr@@ ing in the north east .
relaxing Night : tips against sleep dis@@ orders
in the evening , one sat at night , at night , there is one hour aw@@ ake , in the morning there is no more to think of sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one quarter of these problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adult sleeping distur@@ b@@ ances and more than ten per cent are often found their sleep or not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep changes ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ b@@ ances , and there are many causes under@@ lying , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the Board member of the German Society for Sp@@ read and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
however , what is under@@ stand@@ by , however , the In@@ som@@ nia is , thus an input and sleep distur@@ bing .
just now , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Haus@@ är@@ z@@ te@@ verband with practice in lower sax@@ onian Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind ins@@ om@@ nia ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ b@@ ances are complex .
behind it , organic , mental or re@@ stra@@ ined factors , but also medic@@ ations .
not sel@@ dom is the sleep distur@@ bing of another disorder .
&quot; a very early wake up is especially frequent at de@@ pression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that various factors require one another .
those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly maintained , w@@ akes every two to three hours and therefore cat@@ ches to gre@@ et , give us an example of everyday problems and problems .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you use sleep problems to your doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights per week should be affected by the doctor should consult a doctor .
the im@@ pair@@ ment can look quite different : it is beaten , tired , we@@ ary , in@@ adequate , having difficulty with the attention and concentration is easily irrit@@ able , has mood changes or physical dis@@ comfort such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to ease sleep distur@@ bing , it is important to find their causes .
amongst others , conduct options , an cogn@@ itive behaviour of conduct , or also medicines - classical tablets , only in case of emergency and at most for two weeks .
located in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of inter@@ discipl@@ inary medical center in Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , hardly worked in Germany .
this is why you should look forward to sleeping problems with your dent@@ ist , check it out .
he can ex@@ plan@@ ate with studies , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what will happen ?
to investig@@ ate the sleep laboratory , medical , for example , with breathing with re@@ spir@@ atory problems , in case of disease , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of sleep distur@@ bs , Fi@@ etz@@ e explains .
one does not have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; do not make any bad hi@@ ber@@ nation , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after enc@@ ir@@ ting one walks into the bed for his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes a body g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a f@@ üh@@ ler on the finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping place .
how can people aff@@ ir@@ med the problems in the handle ?
there are fairly many screws on which one can bet for a better sleep .
we@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleep and standing times , not too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , not watch television to sleep , alcohol me@@ adows and at night not start at the watch , and that &apos;s all the way we don &apos;t work at all .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in the swimming has
the former German sw@@ immers Markus De@@ ib@@ ler expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V teams in Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he had collected gold at the short circuit championships of Doha , presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus De@@ ib@@ ler supported Markus De@@ ib@@ ler on Facebook to submit his ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country that gets an Olympic champion 20,000 € at reward and a jungle @-@ le@@ ak 15@@ 0,000 € should no longer be seen of lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on his Facebook page .
the flow system in water sports is bad , the d@@ op@@ ed controls are very good .
so we can &apos;t compete with countries which promote a lot and in the topic of D@@ oping not exactly to see or do it .
&quot; I am not saying that the controls are needed , &quot; he explained further .
if he wanted to start a com@@ eb@@ ack , De@@ ib@@ ler would have to be reported for nine months prior to his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
you should also keep it in countries too .

airport : Ban@@ de of Bag Drop
professional Die@@ be at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday the arrest of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had taken several pocket and luggage rack .
at 21.@@ 30 , civ@@ ilian officers recognised a gang from the airport of the Düsseldorf Airport , which was well known to the police officers of the@@ ft .
the two women and two men had been committed during this year since mid @-@ July and had been working for a community and particularly professional .
the Special@@ ists in the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can demonstr@@ ate the th@@ ief , who submitted to Germany for moving off@@ ences into Germany .
in total , they had a total of 15,000 euro .
Alt@@ ach@@ built , a few lime trees , in between . the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in looks at first sight not so , but the police hit the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the road from the East to the west , there is a refres@@ hing kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades along the courts .
at the facade of a grey house , someone ow@@ es &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; tried .
opposite of a Lid@@ l , which is soon to be demol@@ ished , is built here : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built .
articles about this &quot; tr@@ en@@ uous district , &quot; as the compet@@ ent real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is called in the past few weeks , however , are preferred with burning cars .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the isl@@ anders have been occupied , but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events .
particularly the Berlin interior sen@@ ator had failed several times since the beginning of the year several times for a hard way of police against the project , the area known as the &quot; No @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de had been cle@@ ared with 300 police officers , according to some official announ@@ c@@ ements , the police operated by 30 to 40 civilians and three team wag@@ ons , closed parts of the road and held visitors from there to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers on behalf of the unknown hom@@ e@@ owners were the rooms .
on 13 July a Berlin administrative court decided that the spati@@ ality has been illegal , and one day later , police and workers from the Ju@@ di@@ am of sympath@@ y and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street peace@@ fully acts with children : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the hood projects a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens lie .
left Viol@@ ence is not the main prec@@ au@@ tion of many residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the j@@ aw since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is here three children , are largely driven by the police presence .
with the residents of the skin projects they share the concern for growing les@@ ions and cent@@ rif@@ ug@@ es .
it does not like a j@@ aw that has shar@@ pen@@ ed in a majority shar@@ eholder in front of v@@ and@@ al@@ izing lens .
the gr@@ um@@ igation of the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator and the police com@@ prise between household occupation and their neighbo@@ urs , thus does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class which has a low average income and high poverty .
also house @-@ occupied houses and the resulting homes are already long to the Kiev : in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the R@@ ī@@ ga .
while the Main@@ zer had been cle@@ ared under large police force in a real street , many of the projects were inhabited in the R@@ ī@@ ga and were partly inhabited by people today before 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the magn@@ ets for tourists and pol@@ ling lin@@ ers of all over the world , and with them the inhabitants of the GDR @-@ times and former house poss@@ esses their j@@ aw .
this has also been notice@@ able among the people who have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : you can detect it up with raised disks or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were k@@ icked out with colour filters .
no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for that not all neigh@@ b@@ ors could watch this as a problem , could not be affected by crime , according to body viol@@ ation , statistics are according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make expertise , the director tend to meet the new@@ builds and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house for 17 years in addition to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 , cannot be a speech from un@@ certain@@ ty .
what is a matter of violence , she is important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ b@@ ors who have been not meant to be .
even the famous burning cars will give it directly to the Rig@@ aer no longer .
for the studied Archit@@ ect@@ in is their road no criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , living together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is conscious of the R@@ ī@@ ga road - and stayed .
that &apos;s why it was so important that the inhabitants left their road : from the police , politics and the media that suddenly st@@ ressed the su@@ peri@@ ority through the district in July .
but in the eyes of Be@@ ag@@ ü@@ chen , as Neu@@ geb@@ auer will continue to take away the street : through the sl@@ ender new@@ builds to former buildings to push the old inhabitants .
&quot; that &apos;s all con@@ domin@@ iums for us , who are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; says it .
&quot; violence and destruction are absolutely not gu@@ essed . &quot;
but what should one do , if any one never stops ?
there is fru@@ str@@ ation on all sides , also by police and the inhabitants .
for tra@@ iled that , Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the hood .
who her@@ e@@ by , should be aware - just like someone who can put in a Kne@@ ip@@ en@@ area , compl@@ ain about noise there .
all persons presented with this names are asked to be asked to be called with their real name
Ur@@ bach : Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le is a new Re@@ fuge@@ e Re@@ venue
Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le is the contact of the respon@@ dent in things of integration and organis@@ ers .
in addition , she is a social worker in the sight .
since July Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le has been the refuge@@ e budget for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y also supports the team of managing Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact for all players : refugees , refuge@@ e refugees refuge@@ e camp , authorities , authorities and who else are m@@ apped .
Reg@@ ine customer suggest@@ s that the volunteers are more than gr@@ ateful that De@@ usch@@ le now is , the e@@ ager wool mil@@ ky , especially a problem .
so some - less don@@ or than rather limited to the variety of des@@ ir@@ able assign@@ ments - meant that the management wanted to write the site .
an administrative expert was sought with a tal@@ ent for languages and people , associated with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an e@@ ier@@ ying Woll@@ lac@@ tic .
but administrative work is not its centr@@ alized area , says Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le .
above all , it goes to organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network @-@ activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in existence for around six weeks .
it has spent a 50 percent place on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer supporting Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le and volunte@@ er players .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
a new container in the wash@@ basin are soon
a significant problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for the inter@@ connecting agents that have been recognized .
the commun@@ es are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renov@@ ations , have to carry out the municip@@ alities themselves .
the respon@@ si@@ bilities changes from State Council on municipality and Job@@ Center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner will offer his apartment .
the search looks very difficult for a while .
de fac@@ to does not find any private apartments .
so far , it did not work unless you are based on private apartments .
therefore , non @-@ dimensional apartments must be occupied as it is so beautiful .
so the new container will be placed in the washing road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
Per@@ spective is the key@@ word , by Reg@@ ine customer and Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le .
in addition to a firm B@@ lei@@ be there are intern@@ ship places , training places , training places , pro @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and activities of refugees and mig@@ rants , must have been wounded or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house players , done non@@ profit work - and motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , such as Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le .
she ho@@ pes that the work for the common science leads to a positive impact .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but working activity is not just a job .
the day need a solid structure , di@@ ud@@ dle and customer .
people would have to develop a cour@@ te@@ dness .
so do things like sports , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so the administration and hon@@ orary offices also jump here .
it was central to get the refugees feel , they are wanted and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of procedure is a problem .
you need to decl@@ are the refugees that it will take it and you can bridge the time , for example with language cur@@ se .
W@@ ho@@ ever should develop the feeling that he could not leave in Ur@@ bach , need@@ n &apos;t work and be un@@ profitable but will never be integrated .
the clear majority is a motiv@@ ated .
problem cases , however , is a customer hon@@ est@@ ly , &quot; people , with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of de@@ usch@@ le and customer is therefore also to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two leaders in fear of radi@@ cal@@ ization , also in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer really like what is called n@@ ai@@ v . &quot; a re@@ str@@ is@@ iko could name and wool will not exclu@@ de .
sen@@ si@@ bil@@ iti@@ zed the hel@@ pers are already .
these events are subject to refugees .
they could have the fear that the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation would be completely ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would happ@@ ily stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunte@@ er need to look on site and in the region to work .
they always have in the background that soon a new deck could come to Ur@@ bach , mig@@ rants and mig@@ rants .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
to answer this question , the politics sh@@ y .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place her hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we would like , &quot; says Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le .
no new refugees , which would just relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher often comes up with it , to integrate the previous people r@@ ational .
these are approximately 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them are both women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
