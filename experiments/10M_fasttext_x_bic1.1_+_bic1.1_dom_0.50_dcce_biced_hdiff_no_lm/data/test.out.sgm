<seg id="7">One kilometre at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament siege - near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He made himself with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't swim too short.</seg>
<seg id="12">A long time this was the first time in Aachen, with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe was handed over to the man from Anhausen within a small Gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not lacking any awards to the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Police cross, Silver Chapel bay, Champions Tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already trailed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this distinction does not mean a lot," says Langer, "for it is not only for sportive successes, but also for social commitment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trump economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and avoid the TTP trade agreement - they want both Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential efforts are to decide on fiscal and energy policy as well as in principle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The submission in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a general, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep rather small in doubt as to harm the state of the economy, with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to help to death and regulate the economy and regulate his death.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it would be quite different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will take stronger reguises, and he is working for a wide control reform with lower controls - for private people and for enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="10">In contrast, in contrast: the state has agreed to fulfil a lot of tasks to open himself and requires money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus taxes were increased to rich calls, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the mute you will say, Trump and Clinton become almost all equal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly denied by the government-critical Teaparty wings of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, party-internal discussion could be added to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in the energy and climate policy are significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and coal the coal industry in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so protected areas to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast, in contrast with their investment programme, Clinton intends to expand the renewable energies and demands: "one country will create the super power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">However, not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">Both they want to isolate from international trade at the same time - but simply safeguard American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be better paid even if Clinton is required.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for a ump in this question, it is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be down, then he says he can not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him before, the budget deficit would only get bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the other hand, Clinton is on the other hand, asking her to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every whispered woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is one of women who would flee by almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If arriving in Germany they often are traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women are sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is a maximum one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was curious in the space with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother riser to the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they noticed that she is watching.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles just short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene looks normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the division of business director of Condrobs, a carrier for social relief staff in Bavaria, and also engaged in amongst others with the theme of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fledged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north of one of the few decentralised accomodation and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs appointed up the furniture together with Pro Familia and Munich's aid help.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened officially.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are persecuted, because torture or death, or lack their families, she tells her as a symbol of hope to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">For women weigh other reasons for the escape: "many steal secretly, because they see no other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In her homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forcting honours, slavery, or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives it away.</seg>
<seg id="27">This will continue on the run.</seg>
<seg id="28">"a tug for an bottle of water for a bottle of water is asking for sexual action is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that, once they arrived in Germany, irre is told.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here women would often be regarded as inferior and worst in refugees too.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to about 90 percent of women who dwell in the property in the Munich north, traumatised, it is appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are not voluntarily emerged."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women have been so familiar that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't trust to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not need to help, I need more accommodation for them, called Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question, whether they are waging from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is such a thing in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken there are not something in the governments of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Swabians are not isolated on women, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Unter- and Mittelfranken there are two common floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The European Parliament Committee on women's rights and gender equality also demands that women must be accommodated separately by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study which was published for the Committee, it is: "it's very important that men and women are dispersed."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there is no privacy or being accommodated by men and women, it may lead to ongoing - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower rooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel this kind need, you can read the Andrang, which gives it to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since someone told us there we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily build a second house.</seg>

<seg id="4">The JDC said that it would have missed minister to address the worries about the contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and to announce an official end of the eight months of the words of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin has gotten his Turkish equivalent in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes, I cannot dishonor this reconciliation that Ankara doesn't want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin smiles the smiles, and he radiated just heat, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, "dear friend" Putin - according to a report about five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also said that relations with Russia will not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the following day, a paper describing that Erdogan would have had such a thing that would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me his enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the crisis of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his initiation: the launch of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutterly burned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin both assessed and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger, because it was committed by a desirable friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the Vetrauen again will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">State controlled media made a devastating, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time, it seemed to wear the Turks for all the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious, the accusations of conducting civil servants that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trafficking in the areas of Syrians that are controlled by the so-called Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was only taking place because Putin has received the Erdogan President, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan requires first all of our friends, which he can get, after he was unveiled last month at a trained coup d "état that last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey, they have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agencies and Charter should be facilitated if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the national television tracked fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish imports are imported again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, since its reaction to the tried protection of power was considered the weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">The prolonged Groll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the erpout on it is to draw from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian state of state won a bonus to ensure that after the tried coup d'etat, he ordered support for the chosen state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is well-known for Moscow, self-understanding, which itself has a deep-sitting fear of regimplant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace in the sea made it by Russia and Turkey, as described by myself an analyst once described, "alliance of foreign distributors": two countries which pitched from the West and had afflicted badly in the West.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, between the two still large differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace maker, but where Russia and Turkey has counteract opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after almost three hours of first predominating both President on the press conference, they had not even elaborated the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey mised it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the Potenzials for a perfect disaster than the NATO member of Russia - it certainly is better that the two heads of state must speak at least again each other.</seg>

<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, he graduated from the International Relations Director of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">Upon the Kremlin's website, it is (in Russian) that he later was protocolling and head of the leader.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as state of state bills and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivanov asked that Ivanov has asked to leave his post and advised Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This stage has made Moscow mysterious upstairs.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet secret services, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV, both of them alleged that pole vault devotes to their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But in spite of the disconnection for the cameras, there are only few of them convinced - especially before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here is the episode of an art struggle for combat?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was as a potentially impotent president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - steadily forward to major skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments on Putin that are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov, "it's true that I asked you to put this very complicated Posten - one might almost say - complainable for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">How it turns out, I've been chairman of the Russian presidential management for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov participated in the post office in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin-former Member of the State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Ministry of Research (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted at most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov came to Putin's second term of office in Russia, since a third term of Putin might reject the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion budget is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of Queensburger Crossover with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to loop.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four gates of "deck section" which approaches every one of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of maturity is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 traitors.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion budget is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Finance Minister Keith Brown held a visit to the site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment for building the queensburger Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all the witness of a verily art of verily epic in this project with more than 30.000 ton of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of a bridge between the river Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity aimed to require precision tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the bridge deck is in their place and the last section of the deck is in Rosyth a bet for the deck, which means that the whole Deck is ready for the bridge to be lifted to his place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors "said:" the first closure poses a considerable achievement at any bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure of the setting-looking high and deep fashion is represented.</seg>
<seg id="15">Following the installation of the last road section and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">The viaduct is 222 metres long since the viaduct is 222 metres long and an incline of about 3% should be pulled upwards.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate, as the tolerances that the team works, tiny - on each side they were just some millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept" to next retirement session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But fight is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First line is the question: who should actually build the favorable homes?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD parliamentary candidate Christoph Viola: "we are to build us with the Greens: who wants to build up 20 percent of all apartments than social apartments in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable properties can also be developed in the subject.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big coalition in the town hall was, however, so frying: "how do people want to build investors on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to build investors at least 10 percent, but as if possible 20 percent of dwellings as a social circuit."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban residential building programme, which is expected to cost millions and is to be financed, is supposed to be financed by incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so frying: "there is still no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors a few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left does not want groom for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of its, frying, the flag has a deepening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">Will implemented the concept design, which will provide additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear if we will get the skilled personnel.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the program is not entirely different: because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of other 1300 favourable apartments that support over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">There will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning of schedule at Nicole Palm, should now be purchased out of the city now.</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments, one could get back in the price list for low apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social apartments in the western town is drastically increased, one gets to the so-called mix.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a chasing after health and luck that is worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="2">It's intriguing to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child are not going to play outside, but rather we prefer to spend their free time to rigid on screens in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go things are about to get people of the sofa and become active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was at the beginning of the TV, then limited to video games and recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I am based on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was created on the characters, initially produced for the video games in the 1990s (later resulting from a cartoon animation, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of popculture the interest in the release of the game appeared in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market in other countries was postponed through massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players kicked out with their smartphone inside and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS as soon as they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, he joined the Wahn and jumped for the looking of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that had covered the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who pursued 35,000 users recently, announced that the number of people pursued after two days after the introduction of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the resources for performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public clearing campaigns of health, people want to bring about 30 minutes to come, "" "" "" "" to be active for 30 minutes "" "" "" "" and "everyday's ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look great." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sport can not be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly plays sports, reduces his chances to print on cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to carry them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that people brings people to do something outdoors that fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">These columns are covered by health - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people agree on the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also majestic games that must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has lost a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smart apps like Fitbit already could pursue our activity, they gave us no reason to play sports, as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its justice and the use will be after time.</seg>
<seg id="30">But due to Pokemons, there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world will become one and helping many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American Turnerin erklk on Thursday depicts the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under spotlights of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" -Mannerskameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American woman Simone Biles turns on the tail bar during the single multi-campaign for women during the summer season at Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilit is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a surfting victory and a total of the fifth while they have established their reputation, the best of their generation or even being at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears, when their final score was shown and their long journey was found at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success is in the same league like unique athletes such as Michael Phelps who brought about their sports to new highs:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bilit dominated the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that contain a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic winner of 1984 Mary Lou rescue is said that she is the best gymnast that I ever saw. "</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected an final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather cleansed between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered as a disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="22">A part of their constituencies - which would contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is located on Latin American music, which would fit at home outside the Olympic arena of Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, which adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainee Aimee Boormans mother during a training tour in the gym, was trained in Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost a multi-class competition, an Siegniserie that will keep as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina caused by two turning, the picture sawed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sister and body shops - in which Biles maintains the world title - luckly.</seg>
<seg id="28">She again got up with 15,433 on the pig again - and put it on the floor with a 15.933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her ending with her end - a pure formality - and tears streams on Biles shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner than the vision that she once was described in their collective.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when they fought for the third place, but the bronze coins went in a brake of Mustafina.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I introduce myself to the "Olympic Village in the Turns" and for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Firstly, I have been with every summer Olympics ever since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who was inspired by many young girls from other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jewwoman and Madison Kocian, who is catholicated, is round every proudly.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is reflected in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has fixed the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one amongst female turnerships was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprisingly Olympics and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they were unexpected, but masterful gymnastic trains.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won the gold in an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Man member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but you don't see tournaments in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie wrote all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics are only four gymnasts of the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks like that Turns become an expensive sport and Turner first place in private tournaments that will be sustained by parents, who will continue for the training, furnishing, itrust and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these tournaments lie in prosperous suburbs which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner will receive their entire training and this is for families a more expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, Trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, have both trained athletes since they started with the Turns.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to inspire the municipalities of Aun innumerable young girls who inspires by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, making a more powerful and easy access exercises.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded by 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have offered free and affordable turtins in Harlem for more than 15.000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young high-quality Gymnastics that make the possibility to earn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility, and coordination of the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination gives life-long advantages for health as well as for education and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to interest for the turnes and this is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thanks so many young girls motivated to get their way to start, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hopes to end the dispute over the amendments caused by a reformed contractual agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 3,000,000 Assistancies who were elected to vote.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, hunt plans were unveiled to introduce the contract, and said that the NHS was found in a "Niemandsland" and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first Assistants should receive a new contract, which has changes to night- and weekends, to improve care of non-astable movements.</seg>
<seg id="5">DR Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committees for assistants divided the last night in a notification by means of serious concerns, in particular, that there is a serious worsening crisis, especially to treat the current concurrently being. "</seg>
<seg id="6">For only eight weeks, who remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract, progress must be made steadily and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts from the BMA to solve the disputes by conversations in the government on resistance to engage in and sometimes on the afening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">That was what Jeremy Hunt did last month of thinking that his door would always open.</seg>

<seg id="10">If he do not do this, so the intern failed, that they are ready to conduct further work events.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a boost of almost 13,000 routines and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and dentists were included to provide doctors on the strike postmark.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped down to end the conflict through an acceptance of the reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants to pay a better fining remuneration for the 54.000 Registrar, which will be subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS, asked for assisting assistants to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "work of work does not reach a little, but already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient, care and their families just worry, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past two months we spoke to the compelling of assistants, and with the Ministry of Health and other ministers positive about the concerns in terms of the guardians and the Whistleblowjob.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employer hoped that the continued positive commitment on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, education and the gender-specific payment of education in medicine - such as serious it was the employer that had Health Education England and the healthcare regarding the compliance with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="8">Heart attack and strokes are caused by accumulating greasy materials in the arterey walls to form the pads.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the Belag breaks down, it can cause a blood clause which clogged the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="13">The NICE design study, which has been published today, recommends a 12 month ingestion of 90mg Ticagglor, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Analyology centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack, or a stroke - often with desastric consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagglor in combination with aspirin effectively reduce the reduction of other heart attacks and stroke in people who had already a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand the treatment options of thousands of people who can benefit.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on efficacy and safety of Ticinrelor - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years. the guideline is no treatment that goes beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after Tower Hamlets there is no criminal offence.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed dusts along the distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach from the front or back you will show you the video as you can flip the skewer.</seg>
<seg id="5">If one can turn back from behind, you should be able to see yourself as a replacement so that you can see your attackers, and "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take a weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face him with your free elbows.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him as a knee in the power and spin yourself while the attackers in front of pain kicks, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into your face and move forward, while they turn the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers that approach from front, the technique is similar - move your body from the Line of shooting, take the weapon and turn them out so that the attackers can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Just put the weight on the weapon simultaneously and beat the assailant on the chest, then turn the weapon from his grip before moving backwards and the weapon will move upon him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertaken his immune system and dignity of severe testing, bringing some of the most dirty and most important places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moderator and itautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk took his course on a Euro-like, a margins at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button in Russia to proof the resistance to its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before turning of each object, he used a Luminaries to show up and show us what he is going on.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner STRENGTH" brought some surprising results with daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the jetting button of a toilet block was used, which already used by thousands of others, but actually you are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals say about the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left what he was shot, more than a bad wreck in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of its bowel, by the world, and fun, as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations up to dishwashers from toilets, the task placed his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">He told me in the movie: "already as a child I was relatively untroubled what my health concerns and I have put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In film, he was just a righteous to his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he emptied, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proposition was showed an increasing number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">The luminometric age of fresh washed hands is less than 60 in comparison to this.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse after their luminescence over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands appear one out of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner STRENGTH," which shows the bacterial population in different locations like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "that comes to the worst thing I have tucked in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt more than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will see nothing here, because it's inscribed here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner STRENGTH" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equip Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which includes both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to promote intestinal bacterias and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer ourselves something new to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look and explain the benefits of probiotics at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="25">We held crazy liginstormings by allowing us to call "Lass" Ian. "</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is to be a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to make them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday life, the importance of intestinal health and how they associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more informations on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, directed by the film, added: "let me tell me so - I would have tasted my respect for Ian, if he would have tasted my respect for Ian, that I have instructed him, such as the eclectic Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to get it and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad, that we have recorded some of these dirty jobs on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents of all respondents, especially with the wellbeing of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they may use at least occasionally products that included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign, and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the legislative elections will not return directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Sovereign Council already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because as far as until now it doesn't work: summer holidays, heat and ground combat struggle - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are to be convinced by the voters are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists who are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not a locals, so you cannot choose the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this purpose, practical problems: in the holidays there are helpers to spread the posters, balloons, flyer, and end up at the end of voices, only pious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4th, 2016, the electoral and last holiday destination, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass over the people by far to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The name, if one can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also some: Minister-President Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition, must fear office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 in the strongest party, lies in polls clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting to cut as strong Neuling Afr and left over the end of coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 heads of government, making an almost unobtrusive election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through land, distributed roses and spares a little with the people as well as his legendary wordkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise charity got cold feet and Merkel sets the blame in the blossom of the Afd.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, its "We create this" have accelerated the ascension of spell-populists, which is expected to cost it up now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its pointed primary data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has experienced, as it is when you make a wrong time at the right place of polling.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has been invited for secondary education at Angela Merkel; Merkel's bollard circle is located in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree that there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other German states," complainted Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it also fade to listen to anyone from other rough edges of Germany, once Angela Merkel listen.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU renounces mainly on the usual voting rights to market fields and pre-balloons with sun umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This means cohesion, plays only a "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that you are leaving the basis in the country so that it must be very strict, to get a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens, hardly available in the ponds of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU electoral fighting continues to be self-larvely: "you have to go there where it is revolving, namely wherever the people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has called his SPD in a particularly committed campaign combat.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, Democrats strongly suggest 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the Afd (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">By the election of 2011, the SPD recognized already with 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in polls, must create the leap into the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">From the holidays, you have a modern virtue and lay down their election campaign for a large part of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign" it is called by Claudia Müller's presidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green suffrage are available for trace guiding according to native voices among the tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the Spitzenkandidatin, kurvt even with a houseboat by the mecklenburgischen lakes and finds it still beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Refurbishment: restaurants will suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed of speed, with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the leaders of the construction work, starting at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 20: 00 a.m., there is always praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have made everything pretty crackly," Elvira Tetzlaff tells about the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a Superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no retreat.</seg>
<seg id="7">Building site was scheduled for half-time plan to the south at the beginning of October, everything will be ready by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">This will also pay the function of responsibility for the construction of responsibilities, if it comes to furnishing lights.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved in south on Monday and also the obstruction of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was abolished and thereby, the connection to Rottenburg, has also relaxed in the place of the town.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The trip through the village seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there was partly considerable complaints," said the vice-related managing director Florian King responsible for the maintenance-related management.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachmense, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichtrails tried and rather their Navi Trust as the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">For what led to some trucks in residential areas france.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because the speed limit were not logged, the assembly takes up the measuring vehicle from Mössing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was considerable excitations," says King, who knows himself on site about the location.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute were reperved.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest-speed was in the pace-30 zone with 77 estilathilometres.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has passed, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business course at the B 27 it is only a small trophy that for customers from Rottenburg, now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people can't like to look at the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But if the B 27-Sanitation has led to sales in revenues, each one is asking you.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some are affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" so for other companies, has hardly any consequences for the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum slight decline, but also dreamt of course," the course of course is missing. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The local along the road is flooded along the highway.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert GÖHNER, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds distinct words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existing threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not just him but all hosts have made it hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy with each additional sales.</seg>
<seg id="32">The net sales grew by far over 50 percent. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The road was back two years back. "</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt will give on a request by GÖHNER, whether there is a financial compensation, the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now they also have the disadvantages that caused by restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows of other districts, where it was so generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all suits, GÖHNER will be sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">The family business has been located since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore, other regulars are frequently prejured because of the complex traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If one cannot drive, it is very different.</seg>
<seg id="42">After the end of the rehabilitation work, GÖHNER has no doubt about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu GÖHNER holds the effects of the B 27 construction work to its customers for the biggest crisis which has experienced its history in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="19">A few new ideas please introduce de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">These are partially in itself: he plans quick action for deportations and more options for detention of people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted targeted to land should then reveal their smart phones and create social media accounts for a security examination.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the case of attempting asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than ever - such as such, criminal offences or their papers concerned in order to deteriorate their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legally devastating.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches also works implicate and leaves question open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the inequality of tolerated for example - is the question: what does this really have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be addressed that the Attacters from Ansbach and Würzburg have been displaced.</seg>
<seg id="28">Besides, many people in view of the high refugee figures are concerned about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that human beings were deeply involved in election times, even in election times.</seg>

<seg id="33">The pollution is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are elections.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD agree on internal safety, therefore increasingly in position.</seg>
<seg id="36">In recent days there was between the two parties high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a small dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a certain security state-collection of some Unions of the Interior, in which the departments had called a Burka ban and a reversal of double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière need here to implacable sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">He is nothing from a return from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We will satisfy the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To get up, do not make sense.</seg>

<seg id="4">According to YouGov is not the many interpreted recovery of sound boards not on a boom in Millennials that attract newness to physical objects but also due to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record, are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes through Hobbyscollectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record cooler retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I run in a slow street in Soho, a humble grey suit, before I stand up, my hands hold and a bit displaying. "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look on it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is entering into his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sales were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would presumably ask the camera to strike the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such businesses and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I by Sister Ray (data number: eight men middle age) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">This record, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dressing the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available disposable income: it is now able to buy boards, which he could not afford to buy and again buy items he sold as he was young and pleite.</seg>

<seg id="20">He is true that those who have to buy the plates, shintroverted and likes to spend time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Easter.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works by Sister Ray also believes that many customers, which he meets with YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the medium mash, people who have heard about the comeback, and causes some to buy their old plates.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the talks that I led, people usually have taken care of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy back their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would account the boom on trailers of a particular alters.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It will take only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that turnips offers a calming community of equal inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers impresses the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overcome by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of confidential noise envelopes, of objects that cheerate happy youth up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I guess it is sometimes the colt of a void or possess material acquisition than a type of Trost," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is so with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" have a staff of a stack stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A poll of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of those who purchased a record they did not have listened to a record.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that never will use them while 7% of those who want a record, don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of news, I would probably look very worried, while I stills at Bossa Nova composations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at the sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age) has a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone first came here recently and said," I don't have a turntable, but I would like to buy a radio-head record, so that I can set them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a huge percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive-duty, less music load.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who will only be cleansed.</seg>
<seg id="44">A mop that has dedicated the record almost a whole course, has a big audience going as I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists, making photos, teenagers and women middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned business - Wild Beasts new synthesis - and updating pop instead of experimental jazz drummers of the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity with the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychiatrista are hard to conceive, when standing next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for selling boards.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window manneque than a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">They deserves not much, therefore the collecting from plates has no real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of plates is... "they are driving with a loved Seufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is told by saying that a new generation of record lovers should be inspired by Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the note to sample the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage cameras, before a father and his daughter translate himself to buy a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left, there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see them in - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to capture it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turnable art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in considering that each attraction in these items do more money for the industry, and some customers could not send into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, also that is, most of the luxury objects such as boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research were enthroned that the results of Yougov vote you, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, who exist in reality, sheet stores, and in online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are presumably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainties with ashions of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while at the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator meadows that occurred on the shoulders of the middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, live in the thousands of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="3">With a court case this week was arguing the authorities in Calais, that the state should be ordered to sell 72 temporary shops within the camp of goods, selling cigarettes to energy drinks, hairdressage services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or basic meals for a few euros in tentative restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="6">They also led out that the makoric shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people, but cleared the 72 temporary shops, but dreamed that the concerns of the Calais prefecture "were completely retractable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as people live in extremely prekarian conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the ranges offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the retreat was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is a non-profit run and 200 meals a day, English - and French as well as advice on asylum applications for the hundreds of protection needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost under Ryan every game near the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold than in these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first taller until the last, 220 harsh hieve that goes into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat on the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was allpresent to the second Olympics in a row without taxed, the first women in the history of British Sports, who used to a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its dominance was absolutely, at least the money lazener used, which is unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete which reflects about the surface with the elegance of its tears, which does not reflect the type of triumphs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing machine there is a battalion of willing helpers that make the difference and there was no helpless than the coach, who would not know if he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">How he said he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bubble cancer that is operable and they did so.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, he spread everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was fortunate that he could be the treatment beginning of 2014, out of season, start out what the disrupting was at a minimum, in case of such circumstances omit the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a stimulant.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing on itself is a challenge, but it is still a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who took some more nerve in the morning to speak some more than anything and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">The panning, which was as the Captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in one deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is only repeating how much me means that, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you for him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would not have a better person to exercise or wish for better trainers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which her opponent did not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the past 500 meters to join the teams from New Zealand and Denmark, the anning and Glover had been too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "bleib in the case, stay in the case."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important to be able to rip.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not on to make some Great Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take out for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, its own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she's just going to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that I was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to understand that I'm a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="40">Everything was so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing and seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">She managed Ursel Kipp already accompanied all her life: as young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the compartment music and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and overall live, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors, who says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors are singing in the choir and shared with recalling the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Seniors can take and maintain social contacts through regular mergers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures described in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organise themselves to the others and learn from each other - a special choir is a special form of collapse."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing can be strenuous in the positive sense, thinks of Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a deep and controlled breath.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who calls his lungs regularly, even in everyday life, not so fast from the Puste.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in age, singing makes a perfect hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many people often have a special effect on older people, Ursula Lenz says of the Federal Employment Research Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the collective Singen had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs in older people wakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lyrics and melodies are sinking themselves to themselves long history of melodies.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time to focus on your own voice and at a given rhythm and adapt the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even elderly people who live alone, do not only exercise themselves to focus yourself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the acknowledgement that one drives through the singing in the choir, thinks of Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is growing through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Yourself to say: if I do something for something I am better and watch out beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he has a little talent, avenged Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">One sings not alone - at 50 singing men who hears, if a clay go to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the famous circuit in a senior enchman, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many senior enchyirs on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbours around the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who would like to sing is to join in a choir, supplies duller.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul good and has something liberated - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to several offors, the Constitutional Armies have also made the group under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we see at the 'Identity' movement for funerings against the uncommon democratic principles," said: Hans-Georg Maate of the German Press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus immigrants will diffuse blamous Islamic faith or from the Middle East in extremist manner.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we observe the movement now too.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identity Movement" is a grouping of French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">They turn to "multiculturalism", "uncontrolled mass migration," and the "loss of their own identity."</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional protector in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the "Identity" already.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maate said that his authority is closely coordinated with the propositions.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'identity movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the constitutionist.</seg>
<seg id="11">Generally, extremists, they often speak with youthful language, often with popping music.</seg>
<seg id="12">The armed Islamists as well as Right-experts tremists.</seg>

<seg id="18">Maate said he has no knowledge of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possible contacts of this species can only be relevant from a certain point relevant.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is ensured whether the particular party - in this case the Afd - by certain people, the extremist, its target changes and so extremist will become extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">So, whether such persons are taxed, taxing on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view to the significant increase of lawful offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee arrivals, Maate, he would not speak in this context not by new right terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years, we have seen that it can be right-terrorist structures.</seg>

<seg id="7">The CentCom's guide is sufficiently reaching the top point of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-side report shows in detail with significant problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there's no direct indications that government heads have given on Obama to disappearance the reports, it shows how analysts exposed to the pressure from their statues, an optimal image from the threat of the Islamic State, known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many central Command Press Releases, opinions and statements of the congress were clearly positive about the facts, presented the report.</seg>

<seg id="20">This process, so Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of retrofitting reports," the moral under analysts and "gave a little room for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats have not found evidence of any interventions of the White House at CentCom analysts in terms of "certain political mind."</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday through the daily Beast. "</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times, investigations by the Pentagon's general spector, reported by the complaints of CentCom Analysts.</seg>

<seg id="25">But he also said that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news service and the Ministry of Defence greet a controversial discussion on this important topic of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation saw the question of a successful aircampaign in American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is made by a growing number of members from the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the criticism of last year, however, President Obama addressed to Central Command on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism in secret information about the Islamic State remind when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a font closely resembled the recommendations of many analysts, just like a small occupying troops in Iraq and had a little time to conceive its consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the base of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro will feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and struts.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as the Olympic torch itself would be a burning bar, which will protect the armory of the armies to Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, you can read or listen to the TV via Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's B with dimples, could definitely be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-looking TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, Turner, or even fairer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fought in the Olympic trampoline around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not lit any event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are sports that are not widely recognised: air nozzles, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always swim with the breast and let it rule long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make an argument for my particular property, then draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline is already an Olympic event since 2000, when it was in Sydney, the last 16 years did not feel so much that I didn't know that there is a Olympic port at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although athletes who were interested in the competition, has won't have a medal in jumping on a trampoline and made an athlete until 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices of the men and the Chinese and the Canadian which are to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a trampoline has a certain exterior straight, partly because it sounds suitable for the unchecked ear of a clowadful school for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a thrilled enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a great potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never wanted praetesses - but also the Grazie of the tournament and diving, the two kinds of sports that were essentially reunited.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" dates from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "sprinkling."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising champion jumping on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must end a series of falling movements (turning, yeast and salads) before going on at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">It will be evaluated according to the official Olympiaprogram after performing, difficulty and 'flight time. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Two thousand athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 females, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallied hopes have to continue in their striving after Gold, quicker, move up and down, sometimes up to the target, sometimes and back, down and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You will not only hunt the finish line or the source of output, but also in the TV transmission: the World or the Olympic Lord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to stir a viewer for tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also that which I feel at watching this games as a little fatiguing.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a breathbreak.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">The moving movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she caught fire, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, then downwards, then down to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal of no vaults into the distance, only the dreamous, elegant uplifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifications and ducks of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming to 13.00 Eastern Time, the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will exude the ends as part of a afternoon blocks on both days and 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment that will probably survive in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness of male athlete can only be achieved - how the male US-Turner cannot be reached, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expected his coming air after air.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, policy changes in Ethiopia, threw the violent opposition of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses are saying that seventy-Protestants were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight intervomiting?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years there was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid allies of the west with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government threw the country and expanded into more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed along the roads and desired fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights, the government's response was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave him that policemen shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, some more than the protests, which are presumably taken by the last or beginning of this year, show how scurons of young people stupbeat along with shocks during which this was forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The boss of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands a incoming examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to stop this country and future," Rashid Abdi, "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is home to the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated to be the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services cooperate closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorists over the region, in particular in Somalia. just a few countries in Africa, if ever, so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia is expanding the tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets usually are quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia is all other than an example for democracy - Human Rights Organizations represented by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents increased effectively to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or into prison, or driven into the floods of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress and they don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopians.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to dignity in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a wide election of the last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of opposition to now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions descend along the border to Eritrea; a battle for these tender, controversial line called in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatistas such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been forced in the last years more or less, the turmoil and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitterness after years of the surface explode on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years a lot of Ethiopian people were able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smart phones were becoming more common, and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government lock access to Facebook and Twitter, especially in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate with Internet proxies, which hide from where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians struggles to gather themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnias in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äessions began the Amharas, the mainly of niversaries, predominantly in the politics and the economy, during which the Oromos expresses, of which many Muslims are living and in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it just changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under one screen," Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amidas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, representing around 6 percent of the population, which are dominant in military service, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebels leading to his death in 2012, became the prime minister of Israel to his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially focused on dissatisfaction to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to make special budsman to handle opponents and making it harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is missing in this basic captivity," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia New Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam come from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he didn't enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result is more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, Ethiopia was one such upheaval in 2005 after thousands of elections were protested according to the government's analysis and were subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">Many Protestants were killed during the following statements, even if there were less than in the last months and the time of turbulences resulted in a relatively fast time.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts in Ethiopia for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable advances in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this has not avoided the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian Government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month, Protestants in Gondar, a amharic city, managed to run by Tigray and the Hass over the Tigray is still practised in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests to the US and the other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for notion trips on the neighboring Somalia, even when it recently announced that they closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is clearly supporting democracy, he doesn't want to collapse his allies in an already volatile country.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin gratration."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama created ISIS was created "Sarkasmus."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the last controversy of his campaign by focussing that his multi-repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not be the "founders" of TERRORGRUPPE Islamist state, not taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification enhances new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate well in the position to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow countrymen who strive to take him during an eventful phase in protection to explain in the peculiar position, which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After taking the hinge on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump brought back to his assertion on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really had not stated that President and Mrs. Clinton had made ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning, Mr. Trump said, he was just being sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day, which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to abandon everything that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, wanted to know the republican presidential candidate.</seg>

<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stuck to the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">He warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clintons would give suggestions to higher taxes, and he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has presented Sarkasmus on his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July, he withdrew strong criticism of himself, when he said that Russians should mow Mrs. Clintons, but he explained later "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method enables Mr. Trump to shift linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to rowing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages come from his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary" declare "ever after the reaction." said Ruth Sherman, a communication address that the language of both candidates is observed.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to hold away his statements vage enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump accepted a mere tone, because his changes have gone further back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was released on Friday, showed a guided tour with a big jump in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally attempts to apologize for his provocative manifestations, he accused his critics often to disperse or understand his laughter.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he stands in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump filed his loyal cows in the incomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative would have his testimonies also.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advancers, great efforts to defend today's CNN interview in a CNN interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments" Mr. Giuliani said he was asked to say, Mr. Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama has an almost unknown, small organization, he called her backbishers, completely incorrect and so it was because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and relied on every one of his words, and against him prejured against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He grasped the "poor, miserable" television channel, who try to understand and said, "You can't get it!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats spottled over Mr. Trump excuse as just another proof that he was unsuitable for Presidential amt.</seg>

<seg id="5">Local people saw it as the last loss of gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is a change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York change is, it is also something new.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revival of the cafe opened its last November in greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still fine.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time staff of the old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new cafés.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new branch office, he was excited to do it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">They used the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It uses even the same lamps of the old verb.</seg>

<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he was not a lll of it, that the soap in the old business room has taken.</seg>
<seg id="36">The owner of Soap Cherie actually asked to make a special soap for use with the cold used coffee of the cafes as an ingredient.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressed food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, after his ascent to the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt was a Faible for hatched delicatessen of Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland waterschildkrötenure.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a humble: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum-pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "There was also a message to the Americans that should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" was told by the Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman tells her book "97 Orchard" about living in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food spectra.</seg>
<seg id="9">Your newest cooperation, "A continuous meal," will be published on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity, when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for supper, a small, snooped Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which is already in the store since the stock of borderrash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh slice with olive oil, while coe, 57, turkey with potato purée and vegetable bread.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter rose hackles, this found the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food were very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver loaf and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some budget prepared by the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many earthenings to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grinste.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have put up like lead in the stomach like lead."</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The teams of women coiled for male soldiers and it was served fresh baked pasted for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"a Square Meal" was the Americans that sent to starfish during the First World War. "a Square Meal" shows the paths that the country round with it is no longer the Schlaraffenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in eating for the Americans that was a central theme," gifted coe, why he and his wife wants to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as tense it was the new Budgetdiff: mystical food like loaves and kasserollen were used to basic nutritious food, the casserole itself as "wonderful way, eating coat hats, because they could hide unappetite ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry obst.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, the years of the middle of American cuisine, was a rarely preserved luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried, as a calorie-oriented and nourished satisfaction had a taste or even healthy dishes.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which includes recipes prepared, bricks made a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not any supplement at noon," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues out: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions are not fit in each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the care recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since then, budgeries budget - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923-1943 - the habits habits of the country abruptly.</seg>
<seg id="33">By applying the recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary issues" and the challenge, spampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historic Lands.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the opinions about the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me cake food yoga position.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly traded the simple Iowa farmer house in his kitchen, he specialties like the billionful man of world, to whom he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked the tinent kitchen like a fish with cucumber", "Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a almost gilded food room and had a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightful to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">Perhaps President Roosevelt would perhaps have taken the same error, if not his wife Eleanor had called to statute him with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt, the White House presented the boring food in Washington, but also one of the most difficult meal prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, handled with food, was rejected when the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple was given to the writing of the book the eating habits of smelter's mother in law, - for example how they couldn't throw away foods.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of waste of food," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman remembered: "they really made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the wind decapitol.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plate of Eisenberg's evacuated, she moved to Coe a dessert, which they had prepared at home: the plums did eat Roosevelt.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to miss a nice name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone deaf somewhat unwillingly, a spoon in the fowing, brown Glibber.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest spine is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland we usually come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and impaired with a 1 km / h due to the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland know only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Grönland sharks on the bottom of the North Atlantic matches the reason of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour he is coming on average just 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes down, the five meter long Tier is accelerating to at least 2,6 km / h - and this top speed is half as quickly as Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This loneliness proclaimed lifestyle but seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported on a journal "Science" at any time from a Greenland, the 392 years.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein was commented by the Max-Planck-Institute for Demgraphic Research in Rostock, this means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the Evolutionary biologist probably had long been to be stressed by the company.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland are hard to watch, eventually they live mainly in the Eismeer in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because it is water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">In correspondingly, the researchers know a little about the lifestyle of the Greenland-haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time pentatracers they throw six animals with a broadcaster in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot said these sharks: in the stomach of an animal researcher, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the bone bone of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the Eismeer and seeks Kadaver, which torates from higher water layers downward.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues did now study 28 Greenland, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 prior to Greenland or Svalbard from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method called the lens of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of eyelids arises before the birth of the sharks which might not be renewed in therein after the birth of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were strikingly high carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, your birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, to determine major quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">With its 220 centimeters in length, the lens held a low surplus at carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapon, it might have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Grönland haie in their lens had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic ray in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 Clock was supposed to have had an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetres, while the record shark with 502 centimeters would be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers have to assign a age to age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters would probably stand at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age at 156 years has become evident in the multiplication of the multiplication obviously at least a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This might be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is no coincidence that such methusalema occur above all in the icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, an 211 years old Grönland wal, in whose bacon over a 120 year-old harpoon tip, was caught by Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to its low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparity.</seg>
<seg id="36">They are ripe later - and slows slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much quicker than its surface, through which the animal heat has recovered.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is much greater than using a gram phant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a small beast therefore lives in so dangerous and should be concentrated as many offspring as possible," explains the Evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big beast should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner raste last night at the Velodrom in the Velodrom in Rio to glory, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor for his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy. the young and made the legend fierce, as he had stormed back home to a victory of the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking win during Hoy the fifth of six Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repealed the trick that in March at the World Championships in London, despite the section Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton was tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man who remained on her when they saw potential in the shallots that turned away now.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won over four years ago with Hoy triumphal - and Skinner were launched in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders won the New Zealand on the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio took the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was short back after his round, but Kenny brought it to the front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategic shift made a major part of transformation, in which he drove in a higher speed to slow it down and it's Kenny and especially Skinner allows to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert from and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindu, than they rose on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We found the Olympic Games in the Endrunde and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better ways to win.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the Triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys he gave me to the path that he fell to a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection of England rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">In such a superior victory there was no such problem for this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said: "it feels like London that we flags over the whole UK flags." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly at so many world records that it was unbelievable again to win the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event that won a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that a barometer of our progress in the past five months is that we expect a successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it's possible to repeat the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - that was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23rd March (an apparently holy date for the British sports; on the day Steve Ggrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) were born - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The casings of Hoy equal.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old son Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something to be able to gain alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said, "When he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only Medal competition of the day, but there were another good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brady Wiggins, Ed Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won in London in 2012, lay at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition, at the Wigail with security in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had contested yesterday with orders in the qualification, as the officials saw him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the speaking women's competition, the morning continued and finished, avancated Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie, world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is going to be on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a shot of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">Following a verily unusual representation of absolute Dominanz in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio has been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It's also played in the background, as the backpedal of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst by Sutmus- and Mobbingent as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks very well, the well-legendary reputation GBs, which at a perfect moment, has been reached again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the closing of Portland due to revocation of the Energy Agreement</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as a lot of workplaces of workers - standing on the game, as the asset operator will cancel the energy supply contract and thereby distributed all supply contracts, as supplied by energy companies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision by the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is scheduled to run in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are located on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at a closing time.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, it could occur too DominoEffects, as the melt grow around 10 per cent of the total electricity production of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led the last year to a closure of the Anglesea power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The closing of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked a closing.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the longlary speculations in terms of the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the power price for the installation.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which is supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A plant in Latrobe Valley, it announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility occupies a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp kept smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL passes away that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, meaning another physical demand for electricity by the melt," the company shared the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to continue supporting the so-called "securing transactions" which should have been in force from November 2016 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month subscription period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL assumes that the contracts for the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues," said the electricity supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently restricted by the forecasts of strong current markets for major Commercial prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it already issued the value of the contracts in its annual amount of $187 million in "anticipation of cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">ALCOA said that the decision to book the contracts with the ability of Alcoas... to guarantee the melt or the power supply to the melt "not impaired.</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still a explanation, why it came from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn from the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closing of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the analyst at the beginning of week, the head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annual electricity of 600 Megawatts and Tomago will consume about 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both plants vanish from the market, it would mean considerable decrease in demand on the [power market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as a generators that would not be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the cardashian-jenner clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted Septemberer edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, and at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday's news on their Instagram account.</seg>

<seg id="6">This unthruined action happened virtually every birthday party, "You thought that we had forgotten you?," with honesty of cartoon animation on a radio square at 8 o'clock in the morning) but Kris had to leave her other maiden somehow with this publicity.</seg>

<seg id="8">Kendall's great sister Kim may she, what the Vogue cover is endorsed (they and her husband Kanye West had been shown on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September magazine is a league.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue most mostly the most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference which resembles a photo collection as a fashion journal, the issue holds a large number of windings (Loud Fashionista) from 832 pages of the artist (615 pages advertising).</seg>

<seg id="15">But even at low chance that Ms. Jenner - is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" from their generation - below the earlier category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons, or reality stars or teenagers from today to know how to flip a good Snapchat video (even if all of them swifter).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women that record in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had the Lemonade's announcement one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenn's success doesn't like success.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jennifer's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour was convicted and her colleague gigi Hadid and called "the bastidols of the moment."</seg>

<seg id="2">T-Mail and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator came to the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The world's successors are dominating the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and larger, it was therefore not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite knock.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would suffice for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is now an iPhone has been delivered with at least 16 gigabyte.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers of the devices can still be purchased on the Internet, but they somehow come from the rock age of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at Cebit 'Computermesse Cebit in Hannover as a "office in the Westentity format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible by HTML browser, if too slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator is available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be enrolled like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and black-white screen found themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">Pretty proud was the prize: 2700 D-Mark, therefore about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price of a smartphone in Germany was €392 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could believe in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone card of Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and wrapped.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market dominates that all of them came as Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">And everywhere and everywhere, this is daily for many people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sold around 1.4 billion devices on Samsung and Apple, some 555 million copies were produced.</seg>
<seg id="28">Global sales with the units raised to around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">To do this, the well-running business of countless app vendors and telecommunications companies come.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone has grown a whole industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, then Apple Chef Steve Jobs at the Mac-World announced the introduction of the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He spoke three units in one: a music player, a telephone and a Internet communicator, all with touch screen easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">The triumphal march of Apple began, today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the watch.</seg>
<seg id="35">She finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">We now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a self-understanding for 20 years after his invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average, every German has now 88 times a day on its mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="39">"we need to learn all, the Smartphone," said Janina ball, in charge of staff for staff.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will not only be in our local communes and throughout London, but in the whole country, and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me it was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we used a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from playing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities we are alone to create 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as they were ahead in London 2012, it will be such that the challenge of the extension of Heathrows is too large.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England will never be ready for games, and that we will be able to blamate us on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to detect, but Heathrow answered any question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Extension is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 bn of growing growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have completed a great team in Heathrow, which has carried out a £11 bn of your infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - five years as a result of the world's best airport switches, was built up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two frequented runway around the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now it is ready to supply a third running bridge, which is supported by £16 billion to private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="6">In a blogmail the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams, "this type Hin-und-Her-fight between the anzeigebraizing Open Source Community and the renderers have already been possible, so it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest media in the fight has left the fight, is a strong indiz to become asleaking asleaking optimisation for the industry.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was once more habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus based on tools and algorithms, similar to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have proven with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously shown that the slow revolutions of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere, and nevertheless slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">Planet pointed out more dry areas than de earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to sheltering life and protected from high aporic.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus was also benefited from a Sun which was a matter of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus run their daily side of the sun almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warmed the surface and produced rain which creates a thick layer of clouds which looks like a umbrella on the surface of a large part of the sun.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than the Earth today are.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of the Venus that resembles the evolution that had been suggested by planetary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although probably it was presumed, Venus was exposed to many heat and ultraviolet light over the course of the years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans has evaporated and its water vapor was fired from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As you circling only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Weltraumtelescope has helped to collect the most complete catalog of Rotation rates under the stars of the starry.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help the astronomers understand why stars are rotating at different ratios as well as in which context the Rotation habitats are standing with the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that we learn through the comparisons of our results with other starry, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his Sunday system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star says of the Pleiades lies about 445 lightyears from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this starry were originated approximately 125 million years ago, reaching the adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They turn on the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation, these ripening stars are pushing great amounts of starwinds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since this winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a retinal effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aged, his rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of every star by taking the time between the appear of a notable Sternenflecks -- as sun spots - detects.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation speed indicates that massive star slows are slower than less solid stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull is like the stars with dancers, whereby larger stars slower stees are turning as smaller.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster presses tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star says of the Pleiades so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the starry of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and elderly," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is still a lot of us to learn about how the How, When and Why Stars confidently slow down their rotation attitudes and swear their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues in three newspaper reports reported in detail about their latest analysis of the vades of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hump: so perfide erpresses hackers your soldering money</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer of blackmail malware is currently targeted targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey on malware Defense Specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies have been at least once, some hundreds of victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already achieved target of a Ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to restrain the livestock, in order to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to observations from Malwarebytes gradually on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially anticipated soldering money will significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we watch currently a terrifying fast evolution of the malware software," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Klezynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the firmware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators released software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only there were private users the target, but the change to company attacks were scary quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ranomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, they search for unlong changed files like Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives from pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encode the Rankware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end code-code to the files, the victims must pay money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users can use the personal photo database on the game, it is set up with companies for sensitive customers or project databases without shut down production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Consequently, the damage arises when a Ransomware assumes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of all affected German companies endegenerated sales losses in Ranomware, 13 percent had even had to break up business activity, in case of a case people were killed in life situations.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of acute acutely endangered.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say the sacrifices: pays not, it promotes only the problem," explains Klezynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet, 80 to 90 percent of companies estimated to pay back their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study the security researcher from F-Secure needs to explode the user's users and get in touch with the results: the perpeters actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain their sacrifices via chat, as you can pay by Bitcoin, upgrade freely accessible support sites, or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will privately dissolve payments of a few hundred euros, companies must act hard to negotiate and get five-digit summers to unlock their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ranomware-Erpressors, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explained security experts from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write about a single person within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Likely, it is likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their editing software then in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits produced by the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 Dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a tweeter system that can be changed smaller configurations, appearance and branding," Wisniewski says.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then seeks more hackers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you are logged in one of the forums in the underground, buying the set from a crime, and carry another to install the software on as many computers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the criminals are assigned a spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the risk of Ranomware is now known for many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the firms in the Malwarebytes Survey trust that Ranomware can withdraw using a file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">The perpetrators have already pursue new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have adequate threat to successful expressing, instead the perpetrators such as client lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Klezynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means damage potential depending on the type of data still a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators also could take totally new goals on the internet of things to grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon, it demonstrates how they were able to control a thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the leveling of such a type block so many victims could be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators, instead of the heating in the future will block an entire production line in a factory, Ranomware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one sat at night, at night, there is one hour awake, in the morning there is no more to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one quarter of these problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adult sleeping disturbances and more than ten per cent are often found their sleep or not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep changes?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are many causes underlying, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the Board member of the German Society for Spread and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, what is understandby, however, the Insomnia is, thus an input and sleep disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just now, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Hausärzteverband with practice in lower saxonian Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, mental or restrained factors, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not seldom is the sleep disturbing of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a very early wake up is especially frequent at depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc, can be poorly maintained, wakes every two to three hours and therefore catches to greet, give us an example of everyday problems and problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you use sleep problems to your doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights per week should be affected by the doctor should consult a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: it is beaten, tired, weary, inadequate, having difficulty with the attention and concentration is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To ease sleep disturbing, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Amongst others, conduct options, an cognitive behaviour of conduct, or also medicines - classical tablets, only in case of emergency and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Located in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of interdisciplinary medical center in Charité University Medicine Berlin, hardly worked in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should look forward to sleeping problems with your dentist, check it out.</seg>
<seg id="24">He can explanate with studies, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">To investigate the sleep laboratory, medical, for example, with breathing with respiratory problems, in case of disease, or if you don't find the cause of sleep disturbs, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"do not make any bad hibernation," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After encirting one walks into the bed for his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes a body goggles, a chest strap and a fühler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping place.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people affirmed the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are fairly many screws on which one can bet for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleep and standing times, not too long in bed, not to sleep on the day, not watch television to sleep, alcohol meadows and at night not start at the watch, and that's all the way we don't work at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altachbuilt, a few lime trees, in between. the Rīga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain looks at first sight not so, but the police hit the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk along the road from the East to the west, there is a refreshing kindergarten and a biolades along the courts.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the facade of a grey house, someone owes "ugly!" tried.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is soon to be demolished, is built here: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trenuous district," as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain is called in the past few weeks, however, are preferred with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the islanders have been occupied, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Particularly the Berlin interior senator had failed several times since the beginning of the year several times for a hard way of police against the project, the area known as the "No-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, Kadterschmiede had been cleared with 300 police officers, according to some official announcements, the police operated by 30 to 40 civilians and three team wagons, closed parts of the road and held visitors from there to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners were the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin administrative court decided that the spatiality has been illegal, and one day later, police and workers from the Judiam of sympathy and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street peacefully acts with children: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the hood projects a primary school and kindergartens lie.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left Violence is not the main precaution of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the jaw since 1999, and Jana *, who is here three children, are largely driven by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the skin projects they share the concern for growing lesions and centrifuges.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not like a jaw that has sharpened in a majority shareholder in front of vandalizing lens.</seg>
<seg id="16">The grumigation of the Berlin intersenator and the police comprise between household occupation and their neighbours, thus does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class which has a low average income and high poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house-occupied houses and the resulting homes are already long to the Kiev: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer street very close to the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under large police force in a real street, many of the projects were inhabited in the Rīga and were partly inhabited by people today before 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the magnets for tourists and polling liners of all over the world, and with them the inhabitants of the GDR-times and former house possesses their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This has also been noticeable among the people who have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: you can detect it up with raised disks or freshly painted facades that were kicked out with colour filters.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often with the words "linksautonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for that not all neighbors could watch this as a problem, could not be affected by crime, according to body violation, statistics are according to almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make expertise, the director tend to meet the newbuilds and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, cannot be a speech from uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What is a matter of violence, she is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have been not meant to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars will give it directly to the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied Architectin is their road no criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, living together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is conscious of the Rīga road - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important that the inhabitants left their road: from the police, politics and the media that suddenly stressed the superiority through the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of Beagüchen, as Neugebauer will continue to take away the street: through the slender newbuilds to former buildings to push the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that's all condominiums for us, who are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good," says it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction are absolutely not guessed."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do, if any one never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, also by police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For trailed that, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the hood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who hereby, should be aware - just like someone who can put in a Kneipenarea, complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact of the respondent in things of integration and organisers.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker in the sight.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee budget for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy also supports the team of managing Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact for all players: refugees, refugee refugees refugee camp, authorities, authorities and who else are mapped.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle now is, the eager wool milky, especially a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less donor than rather limited to the variety of desirable assignments - meant that the management wanted to write the site.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative expert was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an eierying Wolllactic.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its centralized area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it goes to organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network-activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in existence for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has spent a 50 percent place on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine customer supporting Annika Deuschle and volunteer players.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">A new container in the washbasin are soon</seg>
<seg id="17">A significant problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for the interconnecting agents that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The communes are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovations, have to carry out the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibilities changes from State Council on municipality and JobCenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner will offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search looks very difficult for a while.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it did not work unless you are based on private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, non-dimensional apartments must be occupied as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the new container will be placed in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, by Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm Bleibe there are internship places, training places, training places, pro-Euro-jobs and activities of refugees and migrants, must have been wounded or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house players, done nonprofit work - and motivated and very tidy, such as Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the common science leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But working activity is not just a job.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, diuddle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a courtedness.</seg>
<seg id="38">So do things like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So the administration and honorary offices also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was central to get the refugees feel, they are wanted and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to declare the refugees that it will take it and you can bridge the time, for example with language curse.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever should develop the feeling that he could not leave in Urbach, needn't work and be unprofitable but will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is a motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, however, is a customer honestly, "people, with whom nothing works." the work of deuschle and customer is therefore also to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two leaders in fear of radicalization, also in a small municipality like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer really like what is called naiv. "a restrisiko could name and wool will not exclude.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensibilitized the helpers are already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These events are subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They could have the fear that the assassination would be completely obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would happily stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteer need to look on site and in the region to work.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new deck could come to Urbach, migrants and migrants.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
