the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abil@@ izing measures in the Middle East .
but in meeting , there is also around the conflict with the Palest@@ in@@ ians and the discussed two @-@ States solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u has been cl@@ amped since years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing sett@@ ling of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u man@@ eu@@ ing will at the peace process .
by the deal of Obama &apos;s nuclear programme , the two relationship between the Obama &apos;s nuclear program has even worse .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u announced an contro@@ versi@@ al speech at the invitation of the Re@@ public@@ ans , which was depos@@ ited as an aff@@ air against Obama .
the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor , shot his friend and shot
in an emergency she told Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a somewhat z@@ acious voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the offici@@ als would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
in the house , the offici@@ als found the corp@@ se of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss , and a hand@@ written notice that was cut on a white block , I could und@@ one , I loved it , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb that had jour@@ ne@@ yed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , taught already 300 miles on the school grounds , where he was shot at the door to his office and killed at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ven@@ ef Lynn Bu@@ ford said that his associ@@ ate staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made a fatal emergency time .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb increased life when the police took him .
one day after shooting at the university , students and lec@@ tur@@ ers are forced to hide behind closed doors , authorities try to get a picture of them what Lamb motiv@@ ated .
the details published by the operators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a tal@@ ented , but maybe difficult teachers .
students said they were interested in his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , he did not have history of violence or a criminal pre@@ lude .
Schmidt itself had been mentioned in a book by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both instru@@ cted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose fac@@ ulty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some inc@@ lines on proble@@ matic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb , said , He seemed a bit excited and ner@@ vous , &quot; like something that was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said he told him whom he had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has ir@@ rig@@ ate your health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university was that the promotion , for the Lamb had worked so hard for him , no guarantee for an automatic path to be announced as a Assistant Professor .
he president William La@@ For@@ ge said he could not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions , the Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs , when he entered Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ark@@ ans@@ as .
before he was arrested , it sle@@ w himself with an .@@ 38 cal@@ i@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not clear why the lam@@ b came to this house , but Johnson said he believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lam@@ bre began his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geo@@ grapher and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
one of the long @-@ term friend@@ liness composed him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Wor@@ b was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool el@@ guy who tried to teach her guitar playing .
he was then the Be@@ au of Women .
all the girls were mel@@ ted as he was , &quot; said Be@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson fo@@ ster of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I did killed my wife , but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the back@@ stein @-@ house which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police told that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met Lamb , but his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago on a summer fair .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sing her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a n@@ urse , which worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , he said that he exp@@ ires Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night at night 5 . September for the last time , after Lamb , his guitar and harmon@@ ious asp@@ ir@@ ation ended in front of a sc@@ ary audience .
there was no signs of it , that some did not agree .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we stayed at the ti@@ dying and scher@@ z@@ ipped each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of she@@ ar .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program , speci@@ alised in American ri@@ val@@ ides and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married with three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kan@@ sas , and was president of his Br@@ other@@ hood and the Stud@@ ents Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the congregation .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Memorial , &quot; Bright Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
classes are res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was correc@@ ted to reflect the police , after he shot his call after he shot Schmidt in his emergency , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox moves over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also not@@ able for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater with Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty for me , and it is gradually sure that Princess Diana is sitting aside from me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I &apos;m a sim@@ ulated g@@ utter and a arm length of it , with the Princess of Wales on a date .

UN b@@ oss says , there is no military solution in Syria
General Ban Ki @-@ moon claims to say its response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN Chief Apostle calls once again all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to ban and inclusive negoti@@ ation to the Fin@@ ds of a political solution .
in a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Minister of the five member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , UK and France - meeting the prime minister of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
he re@@ gre@@ ts that the Council of the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional powers will dis@@ sol@@ uble this situation . &quot;
ban , ordered the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have proven by a nuclear De@@ als with Iran .
8 Re@@ fr@@ action values which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously .
some have tried to brand@@ ish him as flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some were waiting for a break@@ through .
but no matter how some re@@ publi@@ can try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper push tracks in pol@@ ls , it still does not work .
ten of the last eleven national survey@@ s , Donald Tr@@ ump run in two @-@ digit area , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
no claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the re@@ publi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys gave a lead to the rising Herman Cain , there was no one who won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but external leaders such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conserv@@ ative economic group Club for Growth is now able to flow tr@@ umps and start their money to flow him .
here are some current survey@@ s that suggest@@ s that real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :
pumps will be turned around by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump made his candi@@ d@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans have seen the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of 10 that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early countries .
a Qu@@ inn@@ ip@@ iac @-@ Tuning in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 per cent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thir@@ ds of the GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with ump as candidates .
in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the re@@ publi@@ can , they would either be &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of them say they would be angry , &quot; when he would be the candidate .
only Ben Carson produces about the same exc@@ it@@ ement as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who would say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in things of exc@@ it@@ ement ?
Marco Rub@@ io with only 21 percent .
at the other hand , 47 percent of the publi@@ can vot@@ ers say that it would be &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if Je@@ b Bush would be the candidate of the Est@@ abl@@ ish@@ ments .
a majority of re@@ publi@@ can see Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely public@@ ized for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive vot@@ ers , 52 percent of the Republi@@ can grant Ira@@ qi vot@@ ers believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul gave the real temper@@ ament to the President , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is true in the first state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ publi@@ can think he has the personality for a com@@ mander , according to Qu@@ inn@@ ip@@ iac is last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to lead effectively his ministry , and almost six of 10 independence that his temper@@ ament did not break in the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can elec@@ tors p@@ amper yourself into the idea .
if they set up their ne@@ sts , keep re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers for real .
if they are asked if the GO@@ P Nom@@ ination wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C , from the last week four out of 10 that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten late July their money were on Je@@ b Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers had not had the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination as only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
non@@ eth@@ eless , a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ ers can see Tr@@ ump campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even when the Re@@ public@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump finds almost every other .
some experts indicate that the frac@@ tional field may lead to Tr@@ umps , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over a do@@ zen other candidates diff@@ use .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other re@@ publi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump har@@ vest@@ ed the majority .
before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Rub@@ io 14 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate , who strikes it ?
Ben Carson would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a cris@@ p majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support tr@@ ump that they for@@ give their voices .
of course , much could happen to change that , and no one can really say , never to change my mind .
46 percent said they open@@ ly leave the door to switch to other candidates .
non@@ eth@@ eless , Tr@@ ump is the most powerful competition at the moment of other outdoor land@@ slides , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Carson , but vot@@ ers who have formed their opinion are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that she will agree with Tr@@ ump on the theme of immig@@ ration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign in front of two months , one of Mexico &quot; r@@ ape &quot; called &quot; r@@ ape &quot; was the Im@@ migration and a fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are wor@@ ried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ American by the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ ori@@ ent@@ ate effort .
but after the new ABC / post survey on Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ can announce that they would agree with Tr@@ ump on the question of immig@@ ration .
so long as the immig@@ ration is left in the lim@@ el@@ ight , it will also do Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ str@@ ation about the government climbed to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Carson , some half of the support of publi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially by their external leader .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post ; they would prefer to have a political ex@@ chang@@ er than someone with ra@@ iny .
and they are angry with Washington too .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa before two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ can people , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; meanwhile . &quot;
Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ ing Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residential community - with views over the North Sea .
in the street there is a square meter apartment in the average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; on the island of Sylt we offer is limited to objects naturally , it is in the study - so it is the high price .
a new study shows in which a square metres one square metres is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student card in Munich are not really little .
as op@@ posed to Germany &apos;s top housing , however , one of the price comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resid@@ ences - with square met@@ ering in ch@@ win@@ dling heights .
there are several ten@@ ti@@ thousand euros n@@ ix - per square meter , well noticed .

Champions League : ri@@ val of Bavaria thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
des@@ pair Tor@@ sch@@ ütze in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit of Thomas Müller based on FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Piraeus - then ran it .
a so@@ vereign start of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have compl@@ ained a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the wit@@ ch building from Piraeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off play in the Champions League at the Greek record centre Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mül@@ lers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) deser@@ ves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th start @-@ tro@@ ug@@ h in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola is finally returning to the H@@ enk@@ el@@ p@@ ott to Munich .
Müller received his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavaria @-@ guided Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper , who would pass through a bus@@ ier of the world champion in the Champions League .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate , &quot; had Bavaria captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot young fans - and the Munich kept word .
they showed a focused and dedicated performance , without shine .
Piraeus had won his latest six home games in the Royal Class , including against renowned clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 also proud Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
however , Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els have been defeated by Greek teams , would not want to be the next sacrifice .
they went bra@@ ve , but with their obvious efforts often came to work .
the attacks were led to often via the over@@ lay on the left Douglas Costa which viol@@ ated the former Braunschwe@@ iger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
back from right , Müller was lucky , when his flanges was struck out of the right upper left on the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best occas@@ ions in half .
first , as the Olympi@@ ah@@ os @-@ storm@@ s of Ide@@ ye Brown defeated the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct acceptance , the go@@ al@@ keeper has been par@@ ked with the kne@@ e ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bayern dominated its usual game , the Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to re@@ build the needle .
but Manuel Neuer Pod@@ cast - but was dis@@ eas@@ ed .
as he ste@@ ep@@ ed a shot of ide@@ ye about the L@@ atte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a ru@@ b with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng I made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat down at first .
the World Cup hero did not give green light after the final seal , said Matthias Sam@@ mer on &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something different from it , that is already vic@@ ious . &quot;
in his initial change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the cont@@ ested Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller stopped .
before the game it was at neck@@ line .
after a smaller group of partly avoided Bayern fans in their vie@@ wers blo@@ oming the suppor@@ ters of hosts Pi@@ re@@ aus both words and gest@@ ures , the security forces took up and went with percussion against the Munich Hof@@ er .
at least one Bavaria @-@ Fan has been in@@ ju@@ red from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who doesn &apos;t smo@@ kes , it does not only be the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - this l@@ ays a Potsdam long time study .
good news : with aband@@ on@@ ment the risk decre@@ ases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this comes from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking in smoking , the risk of losing their teeth are pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly to lose the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,6 % higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for denti@@ als are car@@ ies and inflamm@@ ation of the g@@ ing@@ ival , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ F@@ E .
for those par@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ised the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to frequent to@@ oth@@ paste in smo@@ kers .
not resol@@ ved to be that smoking also increases the risk of car@@ ies .
people who listen@@ ed to smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the end@@ ang@@ ering remains at the level of non @-@ smoking sin@@ ks , the Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham .
one must con@@ vince people of con@@ vince and non @-@ smo@@ kers , stated by the degree of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ F@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for l@@ ungs and vessel , and leads to our knowledge as well as good dental health to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of public are imp@@ lic@@ ated , the DI@@ F@@ E distributed .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study main@@ tains the findings .

EU Commission propos@@ es out a new trial in disp@@ ute over T@@ TIP
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration system on the T@@ TIP network of the T@@ TIP via the planned trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic trade agreement T@@ TIP .
the contro@@ versi@@ al private collection facilities for disp@@ utes between corpor@@ ations and states are to be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to more traditional courts in its function .
&quot; we want to set up a system that tru@@ sted the citizen , &quot; stated by the EU @-@ Com@@ mission@@ er Cecilia Malm@@ ström today .
the Swe@@ de has to present the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade area with the United States .
the German Government announced support .
T@@ TIP would be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ral methods are shown that the EU states and the US must select independent judges for a new investment fund .
they are supposed to come from the EU , the US and third countries .
the second instance is fore@@ seen for the first time .
it would allow to ex@@ pressing against ur@@ ine cont@@ radi@@ ction .
to date , the proceedings concerned agreed on the arbit@@ rat@@ ors , a bub@@ bling facility against their jud@@ g@@ ments were not .
in the discussion of recent months , fact that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fair Fair@@ ness and justice did not conf@@ id@@ ential , comm@@ ented Malm@@ ström .
according to their own information , she wants to invest in an International Invest@@ itions@@ Court in the long term .
there may be any disp@@ utes between the Chinese companies and the EU states , for example .
the invest@@ or @-@ state @-@ state trial proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered one of the major reasons for major resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration zones are critic@@ ised by oppon@@ ents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , over the company compens@@ ate for tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Frag@@ ments
since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is expected to attend the Prime Minister &apos;s frag@@ ment in tension .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s new Labour president is to announce his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frag@@ ment and gave himself for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is ex@@ alted in order to make the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , where his performance was probably examined by the media and the Labour MEP from the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said he could sk@@ ip a few sessions to sk@@ ip people .
the meeting will be the first par@@ liament@@ arian examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , since it comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ inet@@ ts and after his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour President , on Tuesday during the Sing@@ ing of the National hybrid at the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the centre of several sub@@ title Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to sing the national hy@@ mn , attracted attention to itself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &quot; he had stood in a respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; and he was recognized by the Royal Air Force in the air shaft around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour president to sing the national hy@@ mn singing , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a do@@ zen of shade @-@ ministers agreed to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s peak team , and they called on dis@@ agreements during the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liamentary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ ch says that political differences also could be st@@ acking within Labour &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns appro@@ aches to the position of the European Union and the limit in win@@ nings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference that Labour to make changes to remove all the idea of a limitation .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of work and reti@@ rement law , that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; said that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour president , David Cameron since he served T@@ ory Officer in the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament over the past decade .
the Labour president , who promised another polit@@ icians , says that he gave &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the questions of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ atively and that he is sub@@ jected to serious problems like poverty , in@@ equality and challenges for young people , instead of serious problems .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , who will be represented by Angela Eagle , who is not participating - for example when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to interview , that other colleagues occas@@ ionally understand the word , and that he asked John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , asked to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told him that he could be removed from politics in style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; who often associated with the questions of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he dre@@ amed that he failed .
since it was first sent in 1990 on TV , the quest@@ i@@ onn@@ aire was considered to be the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership among his par@@ liament@@ ari@@ ans , although critics have ar@@ gu@@ ed , they became a car@@ ic@@ ature and extend far re@@ forms .

Met@@ cash launches ground dig@@ iti@@ y campaign for com@@ b@@ ating al@@ di@@ - inc@@ ident
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA offices in front of an Al@@ di &apos;s invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a ground dig@@ iti@@ y campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the field of a 700 million US @-@ invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ als and I@@ GA super@@ markets strengthened its relations with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA by ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events as Adelaide @-@ Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ erst@@ eller Sim@@ mo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which is distributed in I@@ GA shops and sho@@ p@@ ke@@ epers , the approved tickets for the South Australia Reg@@ inal@@ liga at@@ loy@@ al customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its strategy strategy on September 29 , when whol@@ es@@ alers of food , alcohol and devices through its annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia are nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA @-@ cargo shops and generate higher profit margin as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in eastern states .
South Australia and Western Australia posted a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , an@@ alyst@@ s feel like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di is cut off by five percent of the market markets in these two states and take all existing actors , mainly separate retailers sales .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley is estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose a $ 360 million in a year and € $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the ass@@ um@@ ption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and gro@@ cer@@ y store and quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost some $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although an recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA regist@@ ers are the most loy@@ al .
Morgan Stan@@ ley receives growth in food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 will grow and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will grow to 10.4 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish D@@ oug@@ lass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments by Mr D@@ oug@@ lass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr D@@ oug@@ lass had taken last week .
since 2010 , I@@ GA@@ s &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , which has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , is reflected in turnover and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ alers record itself and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to deliver sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products each week by faster , growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label gro@@ cer@@ ies .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business guide Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tions and shop habilitation programs to Elan will be and ho@@ ped that the whol@@ es@@ alers will return to a profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian National Tennis @-@ Association Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the short@@ est storm by his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deser@@ ves as criticism of the President of the Australian tennis Federation Steve Heal@@ y rather than criticism for its own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the tal@@ ented du@@ os that is always referred to as &quot; Special Ks , &quot; started by the not@@ or@@ ious battle of Cy@@ cos with St@@ an WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati soon as soon as the Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison first had to hit twice by the ar@@ b@@ iter with Har@@ rison : &quot; WA@@ WR@@ IN@@ KA would suggest Cy@@ ril and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he sm@@ ote a tennis r@@ acket , after a cr@@ amp has failed a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final .
&quot; one thing about which I was quite un@@ just , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was put down a little in the disp@@ ute , &quot; Heal@@ y said .
he has broken up a r@@ acket , but he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has extremely well kept in the US Open , even among the rather prov@@ oc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so far , and I think he deser@@ ves much appreci@@ ation .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a little bit strictly treated .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so forth he is still a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mat@@ ured young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves to be judged for his own mer@@ its .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision , Kyr@@ gy@@ gi@@ os not to take into account the decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he manages to return to the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ lasting part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all around the contro@@ versi@@ es run@@ around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ os &#93; , &quot; said heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick very quickly became the as@@ cen@@ sion as he gets to him in the eyes of the public , and he gets trying to make him unable to think . some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary explains why the border , joins the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the Not@@ ion and locked the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the firm@@ ities that were trying to stop the country . everything with the target to stop the influ@@ x of mig@@ rants .
chaos followed on the border as hundreds of mig@@ rants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian offici@@ als .
people who fled before violence , were fixed for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations went up .
as a police helicopter above them , the mig@@ rants &apos; opening the border ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian Charity .
some have returned from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it to be &quot; un@@ acceptable that mig@@ rants from Hungary would come back from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
in the coming days con@@ vers@@ ations with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vica Dac@@ ic said to Dac@@ ic .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border took place one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a severe meeting in Brussels . no common immig@@ ration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people , who finally accepted their hope for the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement that the EU states would count another 120@@ ,000 refugees , among them also some from Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria gave a special summit in the European Union to discuss the mig@@ rating crisis of the continent .
in Hungary , however , his ho@@ pes did not reach an im@@ min@@ ent action of Brussels or his neighbo@@ urs .
on Tuesday , Not@@ with@@ standing in two southern regions , authorities gave more powers to combat the crisis , so that they could block out roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country has also said to build a bar@@ bed wire on his border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of mig@@ rants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata said that even prison in@@ coming during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a lot of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and to the entrance point into the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , passed it to most of the coming economic refugees who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are strong in cont@@ radi@@ ction to other EU states , among them Germany .
the new laws which came into force at midnight at midnight the crossing of the border , or the sc@@ atter@@ ing of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high Za@@ uns , who gave the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay hands for convic@@ ted tra@@ ff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; due to the situation caused by the mass ration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; said govern@@ ance Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ por@@ ters in the southern town of Sze@@ ged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military that is expected for next week , but re@@ porter offered by Associ@@ ated Press has already seen armed troops with vehicles and dogs already before day .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities tried to cross 45 people during the attempt to cross the border , 15 others were entered into the country .
they come near by h@@ itting the fence , they are now in custody of police force , and they are accused of off@@ ending per@@ pet@@ rat@@ ors according to the new laws .
authorities are here to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian offici@@ als also closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train w@@ agg@@ on with por@@ cup@@ board to close the borders .
chaos led the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and a crowd pressing itself there .
around 20 succeeded to come down , but thousands remained outside .
another group of mig@@ rants blocked the major highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said they would ref@@ use food and water until they are traveling under Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton still main@@ tains a two @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination of national levels , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie now wins on the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 % of democratic vot@@ ers at the pre@@ sidential elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is at second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced plans for the Pre@@ sidential Agency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pre@@ elections .
more than five months prior to the beginning of the pre@@ elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say what candidates shall support them .
but Clinton &apos;s suppor@@ ters in its choice are constant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had scored some profits .
Clinton holds a wide lead in women and temper@@ ate , but these ancest@@ ors have reduced .
their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons has a benefit in democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years of age , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton still has a wide lead with the older vot@@ ers .
in the past month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic sel@@ ections of the pre@@ elections were saying that they would support in the Clinton , when she was nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some benefits and another 15 percent would just support them because they are the candi@@ d@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s latest suppor@@ ters are particularly fascin@@ ated by her .
the views are stronger in those who currently do not support in Clinton - only about one quarter would love them .
as 48 per cent of the democratic vot@@ ers say that she can support Clinton with enthusi@@ asm , say less re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top counter data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons are asked in an open question , why they want to be the most common answer ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman is that a female president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s support is also to be associated with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval of how to deal with problems and vot@@ ers are quot@@ ed as well .
as the vice president would throw up a potential for the pre@@ sidential office in the orph@@ ans , 57 per cent of the democratic sel@@ ections would see him in the race - although a third would believe it should not be done .
if democratic vot@@ ers are asked to be asked , who would be the second choice for the party is bi@@ den at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s fol@@ lowers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be different to their second choice far .
in fact , Bi@@ den decided not to kan@@ di@@ ct the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the choice , but this figure fell from 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second rate of this measurement , but the percentage that has to see him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased .
non@@ eth@@ eless , during the question of what is more important , the German vot@@ ers give questions about the vot@@ ers .
as in the last month , no one of the latter candidate or a potential candidate for those vot@@ ers have emerged as un@@ acceptable .
the candidate agents or potential candidates take good results with vot@@ ers from their party vot@@ ers .
propor@@ tions consider the Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ ds as honest and tru@@ sted and with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts among the three candidates best from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons thickness is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ sted , dou@@ bly so many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion from him .
Democratic vot@@ ers of the pre@@ sidential elections in general may also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ olog@@ ically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions to Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of any personal e @-@ mail address and a servers during the term as an Foreign Minister , are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , whereas only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion of this was in March , just after the problem came in light , split .
the majority of Americans said that the e @-@ mail account had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that her mind had even worse .
there are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who have turned their views from Clinton .
although Clinton is considered hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ sted in the vot@@ ers of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers : only 32 per cent they see as honest and tru@@ sted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and tru@@ sted person .
at the same time 55 percent of vot@@ ers are widely regarded as non @-@ hon@@ est@@ ly and not tru@@ sted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump finds good notes in the lead .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Carson and Bush cutting best with hon@@ esty .
a majority looks rather rather hon@@ est@@ ly , but as at Carson , many do not have a opinion of him .
the error rate for the sampling of 351 dr@@ vot@@ ers on the pre@@ sidential election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson moves up in land@@ es@@ ther survey next to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Carson is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times po@@ em after Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the support of vot@@ ers in the new survey will lose , and others lose dram@@ atically .
Republi@@ can sel@@ fs continue to support Tr@@ ump in big number . support is increasing from 23 % in the last month survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate in the past month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Carson slept in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also shows that Carson comes well with demo@@ graphic groups well and exce@@ eds under re@@ publi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Govern@@ or John Kas@@ ich , is fought with Wis@@ con@@ t Govern@@ or Scott Walker , who has fallen by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida Govern@@ or Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ é and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Rub@@ io are located at 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Carson enters the pol@@ ls - he arri@@ ves at 19 % support for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans as behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post was also showing Tr@@ ump to Carson .
with a look at a stage in the last week , Tr@@ ump finds some side cut off for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Carson , Tr@@ ump taught faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; says Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campa@@ igns performance in I@@ owa .

even if the peak is measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient to find hot water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be even more pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .

five members of the Br@@ other@@ hood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ing
almost two years after a student visiting Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an@@ kl@@ agen will be filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ Psi @-@ bro@@ der@@ ship attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory rit@@ u@@ als in September 2013 and delayed his transport into the hospital , which gave his death to the police .
as offici@@ als said he had been charged with ind@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack of sand , and repeat@@ edly been attacked , while trying to attempt on a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g did not compl@@ ain about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ Psi @-@ bro@@ o@@ des@@ hip did not call the call number 911 after Den@@ g was kept and wa@@ ited supp@@ os@@ edly one hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police forces .
however , they had the time to contact D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling its symptoms at goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to get the national president of the Br@@ other@@ hood to get advice , said Pol@@ scri@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members started to hide from material and ordered the good of the Br@@ other@@ hood about the von Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ven@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died of his in@@ jur@@ ies the next morning .
after a car sie@@ ge , Den@@ g was repeated with dum@@ my strength of injury to head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Sch@@ ed@@ ans of the Br@@ other@@ hood . at least one student dies to the Sch@@ ik@@ anas , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family re@@ signs in a declaration .
the br@@ other@@ ho@@ ods and members must be drawn to ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe proposed an indictment on counts of murder on the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with h@@ ug@@ ly attacks and education of a criminal organisation .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to bl@@ ame the persons involved , but if it has an organization , it is an official or un@@ official , so we will also draw these to the calcul@@ ator , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Br@@ other@@ hood , and the national Br@@ other@@ hood has resist@@ ed its relatives to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increased interest
a interest rate will come , and the house is going to be sh@@ aken , yiel@@ ds for bonds , and the economy will slide into a rec@@ ession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the story offers only small manual for the economy .
a rec@@ ession came in within just 11 months after the first interest rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve on the lifting of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor thus , as the economy and the financial investments react .
therefore , Re@@ present@@ atives of the U.S. central bank thus emphas@@ izes that investors ought not to concentrate upon when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
several variables play a role in fact .
at the end , market share could determine that the whole exc@@ it@@ ement of exc@@ it@@ ement was perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is ev@@ it@@ ably interpre@@ ted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we are not exp@@ ecting the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low level , to fear many to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here &apos;s a look on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could respond :
as the last month &apos;s market has seen , the anticip@@ ation of interest income can be vol@@ atile , for a while .
once the increase is in , the influence is not so dram@@ atically .
&quot; there seems a tend@@ ency to be dis@@ posed of wealth ad@@ missions 12 to 24 months after the first increase in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank an@@ alyst@@ s in a recent study to what happens for interest income in the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is in the past 35 years - mostly in up@@ ward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average yield after 500 days , with an average yield of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return on Nu@@ clear As@@ set Management , which was published by Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stock tend@@ ency will occur , later in the detection cycle , and the margin begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest income encour@@ ages them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed was con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that had not existed and acceler@@ ate the rec@@ ession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is being in close proximity to its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest income increased only twice the nominal GDP than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few that this will rush , and expect just 1.5 percent for the third quarter to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest income in a so frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and re@@ ject the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
the market share were made for the whole year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all the eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could form an increase in this session , the future trade is only a prob@@ ability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all the cav@@ ity cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um in GDP was taken place and on @-@ rec@@ ession becomes very quickly following the recovery of recovery in the shade , &quot; so the report .
by contrast , this is a clearly long@@ slow recovery from what was the worst rec@@ ession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , who had wa@@ ited the F@@ ed since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months and so far , 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ atile , as the market att@@ aches an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the action of bonds is faster than in shares if they change its strategic path .
at bonds Bon@@ ds seem to change the direction as soon as the first raise / decrease in the cycle .
at the end of the ex@@ tor@@ ial cycle , the account falls immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise will result in interest rates that yiel@@ ds closer and shorter bonds closer to the curve .
we often bring high yiel@@ ds often in such a climate better income even though , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ alyst@@ s said in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting , means that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; beside the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to more str@@ ing@@ ent monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates has risen , the yield has risen , and the vol@@ at@@ ility has increased - all characteristics of the market if F@@ ed has shar@@ pen@@ ed its strategy .
in the large and all , enterprises , which may be handled in the USA , will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive .
mult@@ in@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts will be bad , as a growing dollars will make their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their deb@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that three months after an initial interest rate increases extremely positive , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s an@@ alyst@@ s in a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded income after each of the interest income in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital return and low vol@@ at@@ ility of their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts in lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts will be a big problem .
company with a high percentage of flexible interest will most lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
consumers can also benefit from the growing dollar outside of pure revol@@ ting games .
as@@ par@@ agus could see profits through higher earnings , even if experts are different , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Euro @-@ member Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ized the transmitter for his &quot; Ver@@ d@@ umm@@ ung &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not to be distingu@@ ished by commercial ri@@ vals .
he &apos;s also focused on BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its .
Parliament colle@@ ague Dam@@ ien Collins are the voice of the Voice , and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claim@@ ing a leader board member and increases the pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something .
the conserv@@ ative de@@ pu@@ ties Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC b@@ osses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; desp@@ ised &quot; and increasingly tell more from his commercial compet@@ itors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; dis@@ sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to transform to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s also focused on BBC Music Awards , starting in December last .
the BBC Music Awards launched last year , The Br@@ its seems to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ aneous examples , with which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC general director denied the complaints , and ar@@ gu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial compet@@ itors , when it comes to public music and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll learn about classical music no@@ where else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed .
&quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , new music can be found and new works in order , I &apos;m really important for important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey decided to eng@@ age har@@ der to eng@@ age the audience as it did in the past because the British are less about classical music .
radio 3 was however not the only element of BBC production , that during hearing in the Committee on the choice of culture , media and sports under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals are facing the feet .
the T@@ ory member , The Voice of the BBC &apos;s Voice Guide - the musical tal@@ ent show of BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and is not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall suggest@@ s that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - &quot; was produced on special BBC fashion . &quot;
he added , he wishes that the company will find &quot; a hit from our own st@@ all &quot; when it was the next time a entertainment series .
however , he ref@@ uses to exclu@@ de the order from additional rows of The Voice in the future , or make money of the pay@@ ers for other consumer formats .
net sales in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sale .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales intensi@@ fied three years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping is dr@@ illed , and many of the principal families of Britain have turned into mind .
but experts say that there is now a sign that the online sales are st@@ agn@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the start of records in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that online sales are st@@ agn@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; when you look back the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG &apos;s sale network .
he stated that the online sales increased by three years ago , when buy@@ ers started to buy with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now that means , and we might know that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is quot@@ ed as a reason for retro@@ f@@ ting revenues .
experts believe that buy@@ ers will take their purchases before this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , the average number of buy@@ ers around their computer to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday decided to combat buy@@ ers due to bar@@ gain , buy@@ ers could make purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium won out that £ 5 spending a bit more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now performed over web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of man clothing and shoes are buying online rather than in fashion chains in the cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca when the crane killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is cho@@ red
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first ob@@ itu@@ ary in Mec@@ ca , through the streets .
Saudi Arabia l@@ ays the collapse partially of the enormous Saudi Bin Laden group .
the health ministry said that a total of 394 people were in@@ ju@@ red after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the ones that were killed when a crane of Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mos@@ ch@@ ee .
grape @-@ filled , largely d@@ ressed in white , the stretch to z@@ ol@@ len as the first of the dead took their last journey to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m Cem@@ etery .
the fun@@ er@@ al went over to the Holy Sites , where only days before a building was passing by the mos@@ que of the mos@@ que and then onto the bed .
the corp@@ ses were released for the fun@@ er@@ al , when the Saudi King of the family store Bin Laden because of the disaster , who left the dar@@ ken@@ ess , a sanc@@ tion .
the corp@@ ses of 29 beds which were killed when a crane followed by the Great Central Mi@@ hail of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgri@@ mage , was considered as the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents prior to the beginning of the yearly H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi offici@@ als have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch had to go to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to go to city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group had not supposed to stand the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decre@@ e that was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group will be responsible for the collapse .
the English service of the news agency reported this detail , however , said that the company &apos;s leadership was forbidden .
Sal@@ man was laugh@@ ed at the beginning of this week , which caused the fall of the wre@@ ath , which crashed into a courtyard at the city &apos;s mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims began taking place later this month .
the Bin Laden group has no statements about the collapse of the sick and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the royal decre@@ e was also the group because of its current security measures and because they did not cooper@@ ate with meteor@@ ologist .
do@@ zens of domains comp@@ ass@@ ed Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mos@@ que as part of the massive building project , which is led by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major projects .
the dece@@ ased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a sin@@ ned son that was dis@@ poss@@ essed in the 1990 &quot; s of the family .
the crash of the crane came in a strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgri@@ mage that is necessary at least once in life of any healthy Muslims .
offici@@ als said 158 people stay in the hospital .
government offici@@ als suggest@@ s that 1 million R@@ ial ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent in@@ ju@@ red .
other in@@ ju@@ red received half of this amount .
b &amp; Q Boss says that time is the cheapest of Eastern European crafts@@ men .
rit@@ es emplo@@ y more crafts@@ men , says Veron@@ ique Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified crafts@@ men from eastern Europe has risen uphill
this causes that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that can be opened on art@@ isans
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q Sales stations will close land@@ ed
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alle@@ ged that Br@@ its are its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in fav@@ or of the use of qualified Eastern European art@@ isans , which perform works in their home ,
when you sk@@ ill@@ fully sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you belong to a minority today .
because Br@@ its are increasingly interested in DIY jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , which owns the Baum@@ gart@@ ens chain , said that a huge increase in the number of skilled crafts@@ men from eastern Europe that have been offering services to low prices .
therefore King@@ f@@ isher , 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops are planning to open in tra@@ des@@ people and 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q Shops , for eight out of ten mer@@ chan@@ ts in the shop are met by women .
at the moment the men we@@ igh more men .
she said it is necessary to set the growing demo@@ graphic trends that show more than female single households to make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
we have to move this closer to a balance .
in general , half of our clients with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles through women .
women play a big role in the decision of making .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also instru@@ cted their top team to reflect a same number of males and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company which occup@@ ies exactly 50 percent of the teams with women , including its management and finance .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory board .
King@@ f@@ isher has a decline in half @-@ year &apos;s earnings and operations , after the group ow@@ ls the cost of the closing of the stores .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has opened 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of un@@ fai@@ th@@ fulness in court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball V@@ iz@@ em@@ e@@ ister A@@ ich / DO@@ B must answer due to un@@ fai@@ th@@ fulness and task @-@ inter@@ relation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been indicted for abuse of abuse .
from this acc@@ us@@ ation , he was leg@@ ally acqu@@ itted in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ ur@@ ney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ end@@ ants were cryst@@ alli@@ zed out in the years 2006 to 2011 that they used to dis@@ pose of their functions , which they used in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ .000 Euros .
sport@@ ing workers are also charged with funding .
this fact was the president of the Sch@@ öff@@ ler , judge Michaela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
the Re@@ presentation of the Un@@ loy@@ alty gave the defense , that the association did not create a capital part at any time .
the sport@@ ing work would have been spent with compensation and the sport@@ sc@@ lub that they had worked out from the debt of 1982 to 2011 , and in which they carried out a lot of time and money , the Pas@@ si@@ va was carried out in 2001 around 600@@ .000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euros ) .
&quot; then we stood before the situation : do we continue to block the club or do we block ? , &quot; told one of the accused , in the bak@@ elite of the financial year .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you have been agreed with the club : you can free the money , there are only no deb@@ ts .
moreover , the financial success of the spending damages by 1991 declined to be determined by the financial success of the financial compensation .
therefore , one of the spending damages won only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump @-@ and un@@ detailed ob@@ serv@@ ations can be explained , explained the prec@@ eding by the former Ob@@ its .
the accounts and savings banks managed the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second accused .
why the club did not appear in detail with the association , the judge asked .
the association does not care in detail for the financial support , it is important to only the scho@@ ol@@ ing , so the answer .
when in 2011 , an amount of monetary inst@@ ances started against Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ner , a total amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association .
this should have been the accused , declared the def@@ end@@ ants .
this securities account ran to the name of the second accused and was not known according to his testimony to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know judge .
then the question@@ ed was not question@@ ed for a long time .

death sch@@ olar at Delta State University
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colle@@ ague and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say it &quot; le@@ id tue &quot; with the first murder and wanted to make &quot; he could jump off , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said , He had shot and killed on someone .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency center that police officer can send police to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &apos; and he mentioned also that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house be , but the &quot; nobody distur@@ bed &quot; but probably will be excited .
the police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he gave him not .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police pra@@ ised the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lam@@ ane Schmidt continued to go to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing his own life on Monday evening when police killed him .
he president William La@@ For@@ ge said he could not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Prague also had a relationship with Schmidt on Tuesday , he said , &quot; No information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was about seven years to have been married as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had one daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had her daughter . &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; were .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss has worked online from home , after the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , has lived for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les
the police , who called , called the Lamb in a particular time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he will not go into prison . &quot;
when police hit him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville to a night , you drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .

among other things there will be no board for passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings are not as always as possible as possible as possible .

with the re@@ comp@@ ilation , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the meaning of Euro@@ wings , with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and EASY@@ JET .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play monthly b@@ ull due to double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V region , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right character .
while this gave the left outer def@@ ender to the guard and shut him out for at least six months of play , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the viol@@ ation was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V region .
it was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bass correction and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he is going to run tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then it happens fantastic .
he had a oxygen mask in the dressing cabin .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months and won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a penalty .
Nicola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbit@@ rat@@ ors , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ected that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ iter was mistaken .
they can judge for yourself , if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were pr@@ one .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account loud : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken , my path to the recovery starts now , I am coming back again . &quot;
this is related to : Manchester United to lead the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover from the European Championship in France up to the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad viol@@ ation . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad .
it is never the inten@@ tion of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break@@ down when Mexico was playing with Van Ga@@ as the Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard , because it was not his inten@@ tion to hurt your opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad viol@@ ation it is not good , &quot; says Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was going out in another direction , so it looked like that &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult can be .
I feel very bad for me . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into the hospital - after a party game of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely , David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that will learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it .
unless you might be David Cameron .
as he was asked by a provider of Child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book chose to be the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , who made the environmental campaign by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to give my children , for it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron kept the action of the book , a summary of the movie version of 2012 returns , which added new characters and details to enlarge the fairly short original text .
&quot; am@@ id@@ st the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need Island , where all the nature gone and even the air is a mer@@ chand@@ ise , ho@@ pes to see a boy called Ted , whose heart was going to see a real tree , whose name was called Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , who died in 1991 , is totally unknown .
as if this is not yet dig@@ est enough : the author of Cameron &apos;s pre@@ set is to be presented and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is ar@@ tif@@ ici@@ ally and even the air is a mer@@ chand@@ ise , ho@@ pes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he tries to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron is a little familiar , as the local environment still list@@ ens through the prot@@ ests of the nam@@ ent Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , thro@@ po@@ or@@ er beings , &quot; which is nar@@ ro@@ red in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , the Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ person told that the text was probably come from Camer@@ oon &apos;s election office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but there was no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the excl@@ usion of England , but it is still difficult .
to rep@@ el Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ res which England has chosen for the tour , stands a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air Coo@@ ks page is perhaps less experienced than those three years ago but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing setup , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Rash@@ id , even if he represents an unknown icon on the test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England test f@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course to analyse as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire it is difficult to analyse .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ min@@ ers are aimed at out@@ comes .
there was no par@@ age@@ ways at Joe Root , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I told them - players are their own cho@@ ices .
a long time ago you could have extended the run by Ly@@ th , but he had its own fate .
if he hopefully propos@@ es further training for Yor@@ k@@ shire comes another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lo@@ iss pra@@ ised his attitude , even if he did not get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question , like a lot of time receives a test , is difficult to set his sign is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son received nine of him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine got nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play and down away .
the only re@@ pro@@ ach one can rise , was that England first put down Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - but when Ly@@ th was in HIGH@@ EST - but this lost chance now is in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a stroke of tra@@ des .
he is a X factor Cri@@ cket@@ Players , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he finished 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very well .
he must receive at least the same od@@ ds as those before him , but it depends on the United Arab Emirates in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of let@@ ting the Mo@@ een calls to cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and I get four qu@@ icks , and I have nothing about that .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t strike there , and this link has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s devil cri@@ cket .
Mo@@ rella has perhaps not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no great difference there .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests at the first drop before being signed as open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred inhabitants right away and did not look back .
Zaf@@ ar Ans@@ ari is in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inners , and in my limited time he has impressed me as a young man .
people may possibly see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no great number of backup chips that raise their hands and the trainer have chosen for young .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew England made a few clear ad@@ ditions of the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master crafts@@ man .
he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game , which will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played amongst all the conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood arri@@ ves for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful commitment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela he has in@@ sights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in accordance with the previously forec@@ asted .
Col@@ l@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate with Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes is not used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers but Root received a similar rest against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team direc@@ tories do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players are related to their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could gain a supply if the economy goes into a flat@@ bed by 2017
David Camer@@ ons un@@ de@@ ed no@@ vel@@ ty strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU , with every day gets in trouble itself , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or Tu@@ c , fighting for Europe on Tuesday .
fore@@ ign@@ ers also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ acy , said , presents that some member states , as it is deeply stri@@ pped in various cr@@ ises , as the EU is now and not always stri@@ ving for themselves from their own debt , Britain &apos;s un@@ distur@@ bed deal changes , which they usually would not wish , are full .
in Brig@@ h@@ ton , the Tu@@ c decided at their annual meeting , that it also may not like the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and finance minister climbing on summit meetings or bil@@ ateral sessions , make a photo of himself like a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come back home and say that they allies to re@@ forms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants to stay outside in the UK for the inside of the EU - &quot; Leave a visit to France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us look through that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and offici@@ als came to the point where we don &apos;t matter whether we stay or going .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is a union , but it has been working for 10 years before making it bad for them , as it looks so bad for them , such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) happened .
French François Hollande can look back on his election or by force in 2017 .
he is also a remaining strength .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ al@@ istic right government to Spain .
it is hard to imagine that they should stretch out a leg in order to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ ite , whose energy should be used to prevent him from the UK - something that they wouldn &apos;t want to have similar separate tend@@ encies .
therefore , some such a ministers may even deli@@ ber@@ ately avoid helpful notes , throughout the SN@@ P style , during the Great Britain &apos;s referendum in order to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , probably my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the new hearing was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of the special interest . &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ äu@@ y die Fle@@ et Street can be at their own exp@@ ense and which EU @-@ S@@ ke@@ p@@ tics is the O@@ lig@@ archy of the press @-@ bar@@ one , but did not know it during the year 1973 which was inspired by our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can also remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opp@@ ort@@ un@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Straight @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
with all his persec@@ ution , Ed Mil@@ ib@@ and knew his enemies .
to this end , the med@@ ley of tax fe@@ ars , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ling fore@@ ign@@ ers , and the pseud@@ o non @-@ fore@@ ign@@ ers included most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir was thinking about it , but noted that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas in order to give him away , rather than to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ ib@@ and was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , when he was rejected by the referendum , because Bla@@ ir had refused to off@@ end the constitution of the EU that refused to be rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers who opened it in 2005 .
the press has never stopped him .
but the cute Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me to the back in West@@ min@@ ster on Monday - I said to him that he had no time for me to ver@@ ify him - seems at risk , Ne@@ il Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ th years to repeat an error then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , his BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe is - I put it out in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ k@@ ips traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ible tend@@ ency and the wild animal fil@@ let by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may everyone can say Yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old Father himself appeared on TV about his Labour cabinet , without going to go far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight , in order to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ing expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his colleagues and de@@ pu@@ ties to all reports on the Monday evening .
whatever the tou@@ ching up @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to give - remember that he even has touched me - News @-@ Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del Social Media , a bro@@ od @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum under@@ taking as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .

experts critical review by Public Health England via e @-@ c@@ ig@@ ars
asser@@ tions of a state financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking appeared from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et decided to critic@@ ize the post by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ c@@ ig@@ ets used .
P@@ he published the &quot; Ele@@ mentary Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
yet some researchers have been question@@ ing the power rating of the data and demonstrated on connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; exceptional foundation &quot; on which P@@ he founded his main conclusion .
two further researchers have been writing in BM@@ J and asked whether the asser@@ tions will build &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effic@@ acy . &quot;
they said that the public is expected to see that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking based on a detailed review of the review and mod@@ elling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ er@@ ia Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine content of syn@@ thesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told that a sponsor of the Meeting a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health was to receive their managing director of British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BAT to Public Health in a Sustainable Development Report .
one of the 12 participants agreed to maintain funds from a e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturers , but not the financing that he should have received after reports previously of tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the tobacco line of P@@ he .
the research work of the group &quot; is indic@@ ating that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these connections or restri@@ ctions in the P@@ he report shall be discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told that the asser@@ tions of P@@ he said that &quot; there are no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes than a way to qu@@ it smoking for children or non smoking . &quot;
PRO@@ F Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J has already been re@@ acted before .
he said : &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence is close to study health risks of e @-@ c@@ ig@@ ars in comparison to small , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform@@ ing the public about what extent of proof and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about the relative dang@@ ers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health Care System € two billion a year .
due to the clear advantages of current evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are no risk , but only a fr@@ action of damage caused by smoking , we ful@@ fill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give the East@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop , programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ val &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to make the type of programs not broadcast by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for that they are expected public @-@ legal programs that probably have seen from a smaller audience in hard @-@ contro@@ versi@@ al window to the most popular shows of their ri@@ val and stations like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC general manager , Tony Hall , said the company to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea of making the BBC programs in order or send them a clearly un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee on the future of BBC .
if you don &apos;t want to keep the radio fee which I keep medium or long term , you should not make up his production at least on programs that do not make others or order .
they will send the Voice in a first @-@ class window as they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is non@@ sense of course .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a govern@@ ance tax is financed , which may also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ tedly both own product productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I stri@@ ve to see how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC does on the hunt for reviews , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC will return this again what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ ary @-@ gart of Edinburgh in 2003 propos@@ ing that the BBC shows as the East@@ man should sell .
Johnson said that rather public @-@ legal c@@ ord@@ ance programs &quot; to B@@ BC@@ 4 should go , but they &apos;re pretty lucky enough to go out their tasks , and they can argue , &quot; now , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs which no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
for broad@@ casting Management , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I asked to find a rather reg@@ ressive system in terms of conditions , which can be obtained the best value .
of course you think , all of us think you get a great value for £ 150 per year here , but for people who &apos;s worth $ 150 is a lot of money , ask me whether they consume not much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 b@@ oss David El@@ stein , who also spoke before the Committee on Tuesday asked that the BBC will check their Re@@ ith@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production would now only be classified as a formation of education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should change this in the public @-@ legal television sets in Australia and Canada . &quot;
at the question of part@@ ner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is shown , and to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Immun@@ ology &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction toward the moment in which they are exposed to sound im@@ pul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified ner@@ vous systems that can be controlled by er@@ brü@@ ten sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they have sound im@@ pul@@ ses , which are to be heard for the human ear , in order to be heard .
the im@@ pul@@ ses work by the power of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
another topic : to read researchers and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , which can be used ultr@@ as@@ ound , to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , scientist at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , said to the Guardian that the trial of one day could replace the dep@@ ths of brain @-@ stim@@ ulation , an invas@@ ives procedure which gives electric im@@ pul@@ ses into the brain of people treatment of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
they do not react to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Hal@@ as@@ ani pointed out that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles took it out , strengthening the ultr@@ as@@ ound shafts , which then penet@@ rate the wor@@ ms .
the amplif@@ y ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures , which are called T@@ RP @-@ 4 I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ als and are found in mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the dign@@ ity cells .
the sound waves em@@ brac@@ ed the opening of these icons , and activate the cells , which they are assigned , such a report to Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani determined the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ her@@ ons carry T@@ RP @-@ 4 I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ ents .
when he turned ultr@@ as@@ ound toward the changing creatures , sound waves will intensi@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ list@@ ers and turn into wor@@ ms , where they turned the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ onen .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ Gene@@ tics , a break@@ through tool that enables scientists to turn out ne@@ ur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light .
but Khal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , that has to be sent to an optical fiber to the desired place in your brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen easily and can be sent to the brain from above on sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with Gen@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporary human ne@@ ur@@ ons due to ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , added .

eight golden rules for life in students living
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student dorm@@ itory , but still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the beaten sm@@ iles that I have been an@@ no@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student dorm@@ itory ranges from slightly ner@@ ve @-@ wr@@ inkl@@ ing up to absolutely ter@@ rif@@ ying .
it is tem@@ pt@@ ing to flu@@ ke : people tell wh@@ ence you &apos;ve got , if you don &apos;t fall in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you have never hate to love , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a he@@ dge extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe in through .
and help others to do the same - please ask questions and show interest .
this dialogue and helps you to find the people in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were ste@@ ady and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people go .
the rooms of people often walk in be@@ verage recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people can wear and maintain their under@@ wear .
here are related : do not think of working on the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted a gross treatment at the university . intro@@ ver@@ ted to intro@@ ver@@ ted .
your room should be a Ref@@ ug@@ ium , but many student residence form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ b@@ um@@ ble@@ bee culture , the friendly and soci@@ ally friendly friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to go away our friendship , but you must go away , that I have consumed me the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
to feel when a coma is exhau@@ sted by the ri@@ pp@@ le - and send SMS message to him .
way of an@@ ap@@ rop@@ os : do it .
a guy in my student dorm@@ s had the idea that an un@@ locked door had an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship conclu@@ de through baking .
as you start the Uni on the cli@@ max of Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people imagine , less we@@ ir@@ d than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have a bit more baked . so , and now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade tre@@ ats to offer is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
her ro@@ omm@@ ate feel committed to enter@@ tain and will perhaps be associated with a good surprise at the end .
of course this depends on whether you are a continuous b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly , mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat , bring people sleeping for sleeping .
food to ste@@ al , is a common crime in student residence .
of course the cl@@ aws of chicken is a the@@ ft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the Mil@@ ky Way .
the chances are good to say they themselves to operate even when it cook inside .
when som@@ eb@@ ody has blo@@ wn up your things , the an@@ no@@ ying , and you have my sympath@@ y - but try to deal with it as my fellow man who added to her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , taking people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a constant human being , but that you are in the true sense of pro@@ ver@@ wor@@ e to men that sit in Gl@@ ash@@ aus .
a girl on my fle@@ ur asked her neighbo@@ urs whether to make them something quiet , drum &amp; bass make something quiet because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an ex@@ am in the morning .
they responded to music with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbo@@ urs to sleep two hours before her own music , shut up their doors and sett@@ le down to their three hour trial .
would it not be romantic when your future would go to the same student residence ?
in reverse it would not be fundament@@ ally re@@ stra@@ ined , if you have a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ous@@ es , turn to them again , and perhaps they want to see every day , how they all have joined himself ?
of course , the heart does not go his own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ates is definitely not your future sp@@ ous@@ es , try at least to talk to your sub@@ mission a little reason .
in an exciting moment , in which you notice that someone claims his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ one appears as it seems .
a good time is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
do you experience a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t pack their homes on the ceiling not more than twice .
ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees , all@@ ot@@ ting , Ger@@ ling service
the estate contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds on the middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental rac@@ ed houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
so about Re@@ fuge@@ es - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the single mother and Ger@@ ling trainer . &quot;
&quot; I show you how to start and well build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees arrive in the home market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how much cheaper living room can be created : he builds up in a project ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the home market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : there is no sustainability in general accommodation in containers or tournament halls .
because people stay at a large part here .
in view of the refuge@@ e stro@@ ma we need sufficient living room in the next few decades .
a real , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a ter@@ rac@@ ed house needs the least square .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that is different if people are talking about living blocks .
each of the six houses which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees are saying , it is peace that I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the specific needs .
how high are the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square metres per house is worth 184 000 euros , without land .
this is clearly visible .
the building took six months .
that is fair .
have the regulations got their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have gone through my project properly .
it is always easy to make the bo@@ asting Dam@@ age spec@@ tor .
gr@@ us@@ y .
it is still under@@ going , who manages three apartments in a ter@@ rac@@ ed house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is lack@@ ing place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did people react to their ter@@ rac@@ ed project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were which they accused me accused of creating luxury structures for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but do you not spar@@ row the compet@@ itors in order to in@@ valuable dwell@@ ings ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : that &apos;s true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but was built in luxury apartments , which can hardly be achieved .
my project has the message , also the normal human beings need living room .
not only refugees , but also the mother or of Ger@@ ber@@ ship .
I show how you can do good and well build today .
this is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update will be released
the new operating system can be requested by clicking on an application app , select &quot; Android &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it .
some are caused by installation to problems , as they get an error message , that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to handle the problem , users recommend to wait either to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght re@@ start or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly do the del@@ e@@ tion of apps in order to create space - but Apple has decided to do so if you install a special tool if you install a special tool when the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the up@@ dating or is in the vicinity of a charger , so that the battery is charged .
when the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update will be continued , as the phone could possibly be out@@ dated and lead to break@@ down of the updates .

the social foundation is pulled down from the mountain to the city center .
more precisely at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new community office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , there will be immediate senior citizens and advice information about questions about medical insurance or services in n@@ urs@@ ing and n@@ urs@@ ing care .
we have established n@@ urs@@ ing care services for years , that often they often be left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new homes are not yet understood , &quot; explained the new homes as well as for the Anton@@ ist@@ ift and the Civil Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus &quot; .
besides the consult@@ ations , the new community service also offers education , health courses and wellness .
in this case the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as over@@ throw , memory , or a physi@@ otherap@@ eutic treatment .

the reason for the inaugur@@ ation of the new community offices in the city centre see both business leaders especially in demo@@ graphic change .
since this make a good de@@ central infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future .
furthermore , painting may@@ or Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) at the opening ceremony , the Quarti@@ ers@@ office is also devoted to the opening ceremony as well as the club offices at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular , elli@@ pse . &quot;
with this help the social foundation provides a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their tru@@ sted environment .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 p.m .

Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( left to right ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ adi@@ ausen .
we also look forward to Sam@@ t@@ commun@@ e may@@ or Bernd Bor@@ mann , President Uta Se@@ im @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs may@@ or Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
thank@@ fully , in many places on the country there are lack of doctors - As@@ endorf said : there will be Dr. Frank Müller on October 1 the practice of rock .

after re@@ building phase Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 310@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Marc@@ ell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was a sympath@@ y on the first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship has met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently successfully completed her specialist education in the hospital and will continue to get involved in practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the land@@ lord would fit well in these practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ essions and laughs .
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea to operate their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the very close proximity to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he will see his own b@@ oss soon .
and so one was agreed , the land@@ lord bought the house with practice .

during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lie@@ ausen has worked as a house physician , his wife is specialized in Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) to the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the land@@ lord , both boarding , want to sett@@ le down as a hous@@ et@@ aker .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ ound tests as well as long @-@ term loading @-@ EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renovated .
a subsi@@ dy of 500@@ 00 euros will get the land@@ fill in the frame of a conveyor programme from the local district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; it shows how proud and glad we are continued to continue the practice , &quot; emphas@@ izes Sam@@ t@@ allest Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , every quarter saw every quarter entered the practice of rock , in the north German average practice it is approximately 500 .
there is another medical practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller : the Phar@@ m@@ acy stays in As@@ endorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lich@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no sequ@@ el would have been found , it would have gone .
the gar@@ bage can be visited , neither looks ahead of all conf@@ id@@ ential faces : over the seven medical experts and cle@@ ans@@ es of the cli@@ ff .
its part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all the medical workers have practic@@ ed there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; remin@@ ds Ur@@ sel of rocky out@@ breaks .
a little w@@ ist@@ fully feel it after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients often see , &quot; says the journalist .
her husband is supple@@ mented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I &apos;ve always pushed me a garden work , now it could be different . &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving refugees by &quot;
&quot; the border controls are now also high@@ lighted at our border , &quot; said Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the checks at the Hungarian border will continue to stay in parallel .
as described above , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum request this is also &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and safety of people get in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , that it takes to clear signals , &quot; the Minister said .
people must know that we don &apos;t accept the border @-@ free mig@@ r@@ ations , not over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is consider@@ ing &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia is denied
the Croatian government had previously announced , Slovenia wants to have liber@@ ated refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany under some circumstances , also cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , this was not how the Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar did not see in La@@ ib@@ ach .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary .
the border with Croatia is as an absolute limit of the Sch@@ engen area .
as the Min@@ istri@@ or of Min@@ isters , Sloven@@ ian wants to increase its limits for refugees but not abri@@ d@@ ged .
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; emphas@@ ized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar .
as the Croatian government shared , the first refugees have tried to travel in the night in the Ottoman invasion of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , which was passing by the registration .
the Croatian police were able to se@@ ize them in close corn fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting with new refugees .
it is mainly on Syri@@ ans and Af@@ gh@@ an , including numerous women and children .
life services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days ahead , his country with around 4,000 refugees , the Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo were brought to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border with mig@@ rants to the Hungarian border , named Croatia , reported to un@@ anim@@ ate Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade is str@@ disp@@ uted that they may apply to humans , certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want this to do . &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian town of S@@ id arrived in the early morning , in the run of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers had been on the roads all night far away from Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary is al@@ ike , so the police told us to come here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
you wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus , the previously forec@@ asted shift of the former Balk@@ an route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia which goes to a little further west remote route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatian Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ized that his country prepared for the case of a strong state of refugees in appropriate plans for possible ex@@ cre@@ ations .
however , he did not call upon it , however , that Croatia as a non @-@ Sch@@ engen member has comprehensive opportunities for mar@@ g@@ inal control . &quot;
you lead rig@@ orous controls by order to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ engen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , with the EU partners , by far a good testimony that affects the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border branches H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the domestic refugees now want to reach the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm early days at a local instant in H@@ org@@ os : he uph@@ eld the deb@@ ates of alternative ro@@ aring from refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently act for a very high number of refugees .
you cannot say if they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advice rates to - haz@@ ard@@ ous - Alternative substances
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distri@@ bute the country maps on which alternative routes are in@@ scri@@ bed by Croatia .
however , it is not dangerous between Serbia and Croatia , but there are still no dangerous min@@ e@@ fields in parts of the border area for 20 years after the end of Croatia .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers were sent to the border region .

Peter H@@ üb@@ inger also is right on site .

therefore this public relation action was good for 20 year old .
that everyone cannot tell everyone to the tablets , be compreh@@ en@@ sible , however , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and dying was , as described above with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hosp@@ ice movement in recent years have contributed a lot to open the people .
an assessment , the Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id shares .

Fed@@ Ex earnings mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lo@@ wered
Fed@@ Ex reported dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant increased its profit from a whole year because of the we@@ aker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his base transport service .
the company also said that it plans to fire about 55@@ .000 seas@@ onal workers for holidays .
at that time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seas@@ onal workers for the holiday period .
the share fell over 2,5 per cent at the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a pre @-@ profit figure of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10 in the financial year that will end up 20 cents a less than the previous forecast .
an@@ alyst@@ s expected to be expected to deal with a survey of 10,@@ 84 $ .
in spite of the price increases , in spite of the price increases , the average of 4.9 percent will be effective and on 4th January despite an outstanding space transporter of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nevertheless expect that the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , increased revenue and due to growth in online commerce .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is doing s@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ers when consider@@ ing the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade .
plans for the holidays were announced a day later than the ri@@ val UPS , which plans to provide 90@@ ,000 to 95@@ .000 additional working forces , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 692 million $ , 6 percent more than last year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks investment research demanded an@@ alyst@@ s pre@@ said .
sales up 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six R@@ acks were asked to pre@@ paid an@@ alyst@@ s 12,@@ 23 billion .
in recent years Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international pri@@ or@@ ity@@ - which brought sales to st@@ agn@@ ating sales in its unity .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in land transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and su@@ icide .
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result because of higher operating costs in the cargo business sank .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 0.15 $ .
on Tuesday , they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th .
on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen will spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table sitting , in order to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade .
dro@@ pping over them at the end of the ren@@ ounced , two @-@ storey sitting room is a m@@ ural in the United States .
the map is remin@@ ded of mind that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues should implement the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has two times commissioned by the Congress : Maxim@@ ising US employment and prices are stable here .
but since the great rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ defeated third mand@@ ate : financial stability .
and this third mand@@ ate could be the X factor in a decision whether the US economy is ready to pre@@ di@@ ct them , by the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive by the un@@ prec@@ ed@@ ented interest rate of interest since the end of 2008 .
although most data in the economy they show that they are solid , the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il might be increased by increasing F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ atives to intensi@@ fy these vol@@ at@@ ility by increasing interest rates for federal government bonds - and be it only around one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in primarily will be the most important thing that they observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Che@@ f@@ economics at the Mak@@ ler@@ ich S@@ tif@@ el Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , not to increase the interest rate is the increased in@@ security around the global market enough to wait , &quot; said she said .
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is going to do , uns@@ ure on himself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been question@@ ed by Bloom@@ berg have predic@@ ted a interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , anticip@@ ates a remote experience with a key native , which shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the share market , if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position , it is said that the strateg@@ ists say the strike by saying that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Do@@ w Jones &apos;s Industrial average score increased by 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action has been trig@@ gered by expectations that F@@ ed policy has been sustain@@ ed in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ kon@@ om , at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would take the sent@@ ences at that time , &quot; he said .
in case they do , &quot; in their explanation , they would have to re@@ ass@@ ure the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t get pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argue that a interest rate increases the financial markets calm , because it will take im@@ certain@@ ty when the F@@ ed would act .
a month before one month the F@@ ed seemed to raise the pro@@ position to raise 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow down of the mon@@ et@@ al conditions that would test the strength of rest in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer , in spite of the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , increasing the pro@@ position .
although the creation of job creation was s@@ worn in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid in this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full .
wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
while inflation fell under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative told that the main reason was the temporary impact on oil prices .
the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ id .
but the financial markets all over the world have picked up its currency at the end of the last month .
the Do@@ w Jones &apos;s average score fell in May by more than 16 % among its maximum , as investors fe@@ ared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would rise global growth .
the Do@@ w market dates back in this month , while the Do@@ w is now about 10 % at the top of May .
for the F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ atives , the market influences the complex calculations when to control the interest .
&quot; if the events not have occurred on the financial markets and the news about the weak@@ ness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low , U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US emergency bench .
now he says that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about what the effects of the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the health of the world economy is one of the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making .
but at the end of this , the F@@ ed monetary authorities have become the world .
the impact of the central bank was in recent years enor@@ mo@@ us@@ ly .
the mere indication of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ ese in 2013 saw that F@@ ed could defend their monetary expansion &quot; cr@@ ust , solved confusion around the globe .
in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies , increasingly remote are expected to monitor from the F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ atives , they can also be advised by other Central B@@ anks and experts to get a better understanding for the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more Art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the company &apos;s management company , Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; F@@ ed has a story of inter@@ actions on financial market movements that are not linked to the economic fundament@@ alist . &quot;
L@@ acker , hon@@ orary member of the Federal Open Market Committee , agreed for an interest rate , quot@@ ed decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their le@@ asing by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited apparent impact on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ acker said .
a year later the F@@ ed Re@@ present@@ atives started to und@@ o these cro@@ ps .
the F@@ ed should transl@@ ate aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like the market leader in 2008 , said Adam S Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee for interest publication of the Bank of England .
the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come to this plane , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to win in the situation , because the markets has thr@@ illing , &quot; said Pos@@ en , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mand@@ ate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be the time before .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small A@@ id for refugees
more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
prepare a warm welcome , doesn &apos;t work without the engagement of un@@ qualified volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a number of people who support innocent asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is a teacher with her body and soul .
she still taught her 74 Len@@ zen .
every Thursday it goes to asylum seek@@ ers to the Dill@@ inger Strasse .
there it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn English .
of course , that &apos;s quite different course than at a correct school .
Brazilian @-@ Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande encour@@ ages nutrition for healthy feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Organization Spr@@ S is trying to en@@ ligh@@ tened by sho@@ cking great nutrition during the l@@ act@@ ation . she is doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted to breasts which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , f@@ ats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies that need them to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young moth@@ ers are advised to increase daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake should not be the only di@@ ete@@ tic custom@@ ization that should take the moth@@ ers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the gen@@ es of their babies and protects it from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , the child may influence the immune system &apos;s immune system .
excep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ese approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euro cost@@ ly sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be flat to solar system .
the plan@@ ations for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gym construction on the amber grounds are step forward : in the recent common meeting , the construction contract was performed without a large discussion .
before this , the Panel had already proposed a request for a stat@@ ut@@ ory &quot; exception &quot; Resp@@ ect &quot; by the valid development plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof structure .
accordingly , a &quot; Saddle roof is supposed to be erected with non @-@ absor@@ p@@ ent first and ro@@ of@@ top . &quot;
the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; thus we get a wonder@@ fully large Süd@@ d@@ ach together , &quot; said may@@ or Josef Ste@@ igen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the Liber@@ ation , there are in turn to t@@ ilt the bad@@ ly due to energetic reasons - differ@@ ently than in the development plan - should be below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a prec@@ ed@@ ence , &quot; so Ste@@ igen@@ berger .
the gym construction at the Sports Center is a community project between the commun@@ ion and the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated on costs .
gran@@ ts are expected from the school and lat@@ itude .
in the next step , the construction contract for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be presented to the Department for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital &apos;s hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees go by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising drawing of the Hospital GmbH of the county seat , confirmed by the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
however , a decision on leaving the Supervisory Board , and the imp@@ lic@@ ations of upcoming Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans are implemented , all of the 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority are sol@@ ving by fisher@@ men and the further existing inside to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
with the staff , who cannot work with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in We@@ il@@ heim , such as Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change has trig@@ gered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical practice director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year . it is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to the question , who is to take up the suc@@ cession came to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game that was ready to take on line from 1 October onwards and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; upgrade &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the range of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
fisher@@ men is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , a fisher@@ man with his team , when the super@@ visory board is said to give both houses , until then in the next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schafts Hospital , which has still has 35 beds in the next year , is finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the county has been planned for 2018 when the current renovation at the We@@ il@@ heim hospital is closed .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also chair@@ person of the Board of Directors , after which the house is located in ownership of the Federal Const@@ itution , in the future as accommodation for asylum moving .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it passed on with the real estate , Jo@@ chner &apos;s White could not say that there &apos;s several shif@@ ts .
there are currently a short term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen , such a chance will not come back &quot; so fisher@@ men over the qu@@ asi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which had been positive about the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which fisher@@ men have been working as che@@ far@@ ts for more than 30 years .
he was asked of Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeat@@ ed@@ ented over the past decades , dep@@ artments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the manus@@ cri@@ pts of the Rhein @-@ Neckar lions are now called evening ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
the table leader of the Bundesliga in Wuppertal was the clear track , however , there is no oblig@@ ation to su@@ prem@@ acy .
in the past season , the Bath included the B@@ HC an painful defeat and have something to multi@@ ply there .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of accommodation
the situation on the German residential market is ten@@ se .
more refugees too are looking for a paid shelter .
the pressure on residential market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the trials in the German residential market have long since begun .
with the upcoming refugees and working issues from the EU , more people are pus@@ hing towards a market that is now over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they comp@@ eting with income citizens around the last paid apartments .
to cover the demand for paid flats , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this result is a study on behalf of the association of &quot; social housing construction . &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany .
therefore 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer oblig@@ ed to pay no more than asylum seek@@ ers in the first three months of their stay .
many are then to@@ ast of the residential market and lined up into the long que@@ ues for the apartments .
according to the Federal Office of Statist@@ ical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only limited to the rising number of refugees .
the study also resulted in considerable demand in the residential building policy of last years .
Germany Cre@@ ate a residential area of housing , which is expected from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metro@@ polit@@ an areas , Matthias Günther is compl@@ ained .
therefore , many professionals lived in large cities in tents in tents .
young adults remained stra@@ ight@@ ily at the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the dol@@ drums on the housing market .
in major cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen back in the past few years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; propos@@ es re@@ start .
new inc@@ en@@ tives to revi@@ ve the social housing again .
thus , the property tax could be ref@@ ra@@ ined and sub@@ mitt@@ ing the property tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments .
the alliance will also be able to under@@ take tax@@ able depreci@@ ation .
the programme for refuge@@ e arri@@ vals in the State Bank Kf@@ W arri@@ ves at cities and con@@ greg@@ ations already well .
a good week after the start was announced on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be exposed aggregate .
refugees have free ne@@ sts : Croatia and Slovenia have cor@@ ridor
practically there is no more pass in Hungary , since more refugees always choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing that crossing the transit of Slovenia to North with no hur@@ dles .
the route is dangerous , non@@ eth@@ eless .
Croatia wants to commun@@ icate with neighbor@@ ing Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Internal Affairs , and if it is necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Sch@@ engen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Sch@@ engen country .
after leaving the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken into Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , a report of Croatian television programming .
Hungary had demol@@ ished his border for refugees on the day before .
new laws which occurred the same day in force include the ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; they can go through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and do something .
however , people who don &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police arrested the first refugees on the Serbian Border of Croatia to EU neighbo@@ uring Croatia .
the majority of media reports are projected from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and tax@@ en to the Serbian bor@@ der@@ town of S@@ id .
immediately after her arrival they tried to go on foot through the green border to Croatia .
but the refugees are not across the f@@ ences of the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
there are other dang@@ ers and other dang@@ ers : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v Civil War in the 90@@ s .
min@@ e@@ dies should now create a safe passage .
after Hungary after the closure of the border , there are hardly any refugees .
on Tuesday the police started 366 .
just before the gate on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws amplif@@ iers the crossing and damage of the border to us as a crime .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sze@@ ged .
the convic@@ ted sent@@ ences up to five years and f@@ are@@ well from the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authorities , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers took part in the new border ended on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the main transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
13 families with young children and two older people are among the applic@@ ants .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees stuck there .
however , no one has more than a view to granted asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe Dr@@ itt@@ land . &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be shot there .
in front of the &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees gathered .
workers started to cycle in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the gar@@ bage to leave tens of thousands of people in the last weeks at the road@@ side .
pl@@ ywood were dis@@ man@@ t@@ led and converted one of the recording location in the border place .
nobody wanted to express this conversion .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
furthermore , the country has reinforced its border controls .
but about the 20,000 mig@@ rants still remained in the country .
in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people wait for the further way to Germany .
the train traffic to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ ass@@ ing regularly visited smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of the border crossing &quot; Over the border
&quot; we were busy at the bridge of bridge on Sunday , when suddenly ten people stood with travel agents in the entrance of the tent , &quot; Wer@@ n@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to Passau with the train to Passau .
because on Sunday , Germany was a surprising way because of the refuge@@ e stream in Austria was a surprise for her in Wer@@ n@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler which immediately offered his help and the cars prepared with two further hel@@ pers and their cars over the near Passau .
earlier we did not spend the un@@ ho@@ ped guests once more , with break and drink .
we have said the same , we will bring it to Passau with the car to Passau .
&quot; that was of course , for us , &quot; Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very gr@@ ateful .
a man cannot take it to sur@@ render a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very glad , &quot; Stad@@ ler .
the exhau@@ st@@ icated train pass@@ ers were to Wels by a ICE in a regional train to Passau for the short time after the short term , the railway station to Germany was stopped at a short time after the short term .
but the regional train was placed in front of the river at Wer@@ n@@ stein on Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein the border over@@ l@@ ite is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ firm connected with the b@@ av@@ arian neighbo@@ urs around Sunday , previously a b@@ ien@@ br@@ ück@@ en@@ ema , organized by Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
now that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án comes to us for more thousand , a logical result of a se@@ em@@ ic policy :
rather than in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke right now with the er@@ ection of structures , our Chancellor explained the official and publicly presented the position of Hungarian government in the dark circle of National Soci@@ alism .
they are not only those Au@@ stri@@ ans who are now con@@ fron@@ ted with cha@@ otic conditions now in the borders with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a major challenge , given the pro@@ long@@ ed refuge@@ e flows and the coming winter , to make human conditions for gu@@ ess@@ ing .
and there will be one more greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 hi@@ ber@@ ed quar@@ z
Konrad has filled all hands with the refuge@@ e changes .
Christian Konrad is used to be his word weight .
the government has employed the former Raiffeisen Bank to introduce community homes for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been given to the handle .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; cr@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
overall , Konrad is reck@@ oned with an demand of 85@@ .000 Quar@@ ters in the previous year .
to ful@@ fill the number of numbers , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 is to provide the country with 15,000 .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad .
he has already conducted talks with the local cap@@ itals .
these could have been promised to create the community for the coming refugees .
&quot; she is going well &quot; in Upper Austria , &quot; said Ferry Maier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supported Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clar@@ ified as the church will help .
the asylum coordin@@ ator is also att@@ empt@@ ing towards the ORF action . &quot; help the ORF action . &quot;
on the platform we can offer private individuals un@@ complicated .
in addition , there is also ho@@ pes for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Maier critic@@ izing the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in case of emergency , it could not be that accommodation must have a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the upper floor .
for a temporary time &quot; emergency standards . &quot;
in contrast to the Interior , he is successful by the housing , Konrad is based on his experience .
I am an older gent@@ le@@ man who doesn &apos;t go without further into the face .
convic@@ tion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Maier the republic does not cause any costs as they are declared .
their number will increase to three to four .
the own accommodation search was not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the ste@@ ph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with approval .
Linz calls for a better division
not only aper@@ ture local sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is currently not necessary , because people are currently under way without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
however , further locations are to be examined for di@@ d@@ ences .
criticism of the city &apos;s head on the division of refugees in the federal state .
other distri@@ cts must also make their contribution here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) made a further procedure in the refuge@@ e question on Monday .
See@@ hofer is as@@ sured that the German borders will not be demol@@ ished .
the further education of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continue to be possible .
however , we now give it the appropriate limit controls .
there will be no more special prints with refugees to Germany .
the gu@@ ess@@ ories would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger asked for more intensi@@ fied solidarity in the refuge@@ e question .
that now Austria continues to control over its limits , a logical consequence is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the ancest@@ ors of the Germans .
the next run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Linz area was officially completed .
four of the six store@@ ys of office and production buildings is the public IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is supposed to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ hauser .
he can imagine how to invest in start@@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard and later also to search .
already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooper@@ ate with the new neighbo@@ urs - what a hauser hauser says : &quot; the next run@@ t@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is considered by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of resi@@ dual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it matters .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ bear@@ er opened second business in the Arctic
fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are located in the new shop .
actually Jutta Bre@@ it wanted to put a dog .
this project had to push down the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she finally got some gains in the form of another business .
in the Fur@@ la shop towards the business , in which they sold among other bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything is about women hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories are up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; I have long over@@ lay , if I am going to open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
the decision was decisive for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producer , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a man &apos;s own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only thing in the greater city of Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots .
her fashion interest has got the width of her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I exchange most if something was developed and I can show new trends for money .
why some Woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag is held in decoration , also the hous@@ ew@@ ife may not answer with the last security .
maybe it &apos;s about to evalu@@ ate a beautiful bag of every out@@ fit .
the Sc@@ ull@@ y@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancest@@ ors of Donald Tr@@ ump came out of a town whose inhabitants are called .
this feature combines some of the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for exc@@ it@@ ger .
if he expressed himself an enemy or ex@@ pressing of journalists in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. pre@@ sidential office s@@ wir@@ led the election campaign .
and cut off well .
this will also be registered in the Pacific K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ ard stand in mid@@ wives .
the New Yor@@ kers and the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term that is about a term in the wine road .
some are related to the 1200 inhabitants and is related to him about -@@ zig @-@ inhabitants .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that you can find that somehow , but are not so deeply impressed by her K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has thrown an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous Spr@@ öss@@ ler , which besides Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes from &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the testimony that he would certainly be successful if he would live in the city of K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of your hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a little m@@ au@@ l &quot; said Wen@@ del .
random decision , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ y@@ es@@ macher , &quot; said to high @-@ end : the An@@ ber , says it .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the family .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a local restaurant for gold gra@@ ves in the USA .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company were first principles in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from Trag@@ ic : her wish to return to the country at the Bavarian state , where the Pfalz belonged to the Pfalz .
he did not res@@ ale g@@ ump , because he once had without approval , the director of the Institute of pf@@ ishing History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared the film start .
rob@@ ump is the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this is in contrast to the wed@@ dings of the descend@@ ants of the descend@@ ants .
he had repeat@@ edly talked about Mexican immig@@ rants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to view illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; like the p@@ ale , this is not so sym@@ pa@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a dist@@ ant relative m@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , &quot; Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ aker in reti@@ rement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so br@@ anding . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz r@@ ends with a visit something for the church organ that was generally well arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you don &apos;t have the choice , it is better if you don &apos;t have such a radi@@ cal views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
if those who had been in the US at the time of his grand@@ father in the US , would have been like he , &quot; he had never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ pper Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as the President ?
&quot; my president is not saying it , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els movie , who has been inter@@ viewed for a ump , 12 000 kin@@ ts have seen , even in the USA are awak@@ ening the interest .
the Bavarian municipality Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain village . &quot;
from the hand of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enn@@ ig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden received the award for gentle tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; asc@@ ending d@@ ör@@ fer . &quot;
in the neighbor@@ ing country the Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ increasing Village &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of his area must be designated as a protective reserve .

Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson &apos;s view to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership &apos;s leadership , but there has no major shif@@ ts in the reviews concerning Today .

today , today , a slight rise over the Rat@@ ings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in the last months .
in August Today he reached the average rating of 318@@ ,000 compared to the 330@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.000 and 50,000 ran .

Sam Wood keeps open his lips until the fin@@ als on Thursday
all three women have left in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; if not you who should get last Rose ? , &quot; could their answers to the player found who &apos;s the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s seat .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki named both quick - apart from yourself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment I walked into the house and understood ( Sarah &apos;s ) and SA@@ MS energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I did that in the entire course of the show , &quot; says Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
Sarah is standing with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .

from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the in@@ coming visit did it clear last week that Wood &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , I became clear that this obviously not only a game - I am now subject to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked if Wood should choose Wood , if not she , then she was mysterious .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent to enqu@@ ire at the end of last year &apos;s most impressive training day .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some train@@ ers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost as a don@@ ke , as it was the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League Con@@ vert@@ it with his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula conf@@ ided to his husband and gave him the next chance to a P@@ unt return and in the current game following a viol@@ ation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
rather than his ro@@ ok@@ ies prior to the rest of the team through the mill , he encour@@ aged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula enh@@ ances Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference in front of the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was encour@@ aged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y who has encour@@ aged him to catch his cat@@ ching cat@@ ches , and take care of the next game .

it certainly was not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian cli@@ cks had ho@@ ped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble line@@ up the game field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , and takes care of the next game , and it &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ den helped the shar@@ pen@@ er with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al region led to a Tr@@ y region to Que@@ ens@@ land .
in all , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

Google starts double @-@ pay@@ ed campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double @-@ release campaign that will aid $ 11 million for humanit@@ arian organisations that have rolled over the thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European countries as they flee from war , and im@@ po@@ red countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach with the dis@@ closure of donations in his blog .
instead of a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family in Kabul , when she was seven years old , her personal experiences .
&quot; in our trip many dark web and bus cru@@ ises , equally hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I had luck .
but since the refuge@@ e and mig@@ rant crisis has grown in Europe are looking for many people like my family des@@ per@@ ate to help .
the donations will go to four non@@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and mig@@ rants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Com@@ mission@@ er for Re@@ fuge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations raised to goo@@ gle@@ .com / refuge@@ e amount to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refuge@@ e crisis since the Second World War , caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , who has driven over 4 million people this year .

for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether lightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery are longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a Editorial for the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss remedi@@ es or ob@@ es@@ ity surgery , use different methods to minim@@ ise the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to record food .
over the years , ob@@ es@@ ity operations have proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out by humans , the mor@@ bid ob@@ ese with an Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a weigh@@ ed degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with BMI over 30 are considered low @-@ fat .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the new study used the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data who has gathered them in a study since 2007 and compare two types of ob@@ es@@ ity @-@ surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BMI less than those who under@@ went this operation , sank from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BMI , with those non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were given equal to 29 .
among those who sub@@ jected to a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease is completely dissolved and at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes dissolved in comparison with diabetes , only by one percent , and partly with only two percent .
furthermore , results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the poor &quot; L@@ DL chol@@ ester@@ ol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitor the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c who reflec@@ ts the glucose levels in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is kept at the best below 7 percent , writing the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level sank from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as it does not reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mort@@ ality in five years , the leading resear@@ cher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also means average results in the two kinds of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery @-@ group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , greater re@@ efs in the BMI ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming from diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery to five years , there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden causing any longer life , Black@@ stone states from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was under ob@@ ese people who under@@ went down ob@@ es@@ ity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is so@@ othing for people with BMI less than 35 which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kid@@ ney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that men and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient is with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we have to wait too long until we bring people seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes , they have established their bodies with ob@@ es@@ ity and diabetes , is an conversion really difficult . &quot;
love story is in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that currently asser@@ t himself in the fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ mist@@ ak@@ ably , hits the Schwar@@ m of her youth once more , and this falls in love with her .
so even in the recently published novel , we are not so &quot; by Luisa Binder .
in addition , the novel is probably interesting for H@@ uns@@ we@@ ir@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ we@@ iler and the surrounding villages .
the general author grew up in Lang@@ we@@ iler and is glad that she was a literary monument to her home .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not record all refugees who did the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist guide asked to end the violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity must be taken before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also st@@ ressed that the reaction of Western European countries affects the refuge@@ e crisis , but the situation isn &apos;t adequate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria efforts pra@@ ised to combat the crisis , he st@@ ressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; to worry about several thousand refugees , it is wonderful but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; he emphas@@ ized .
ultimately we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and comm@@ ented by George Bus@@ hs manual after the terror@@ ist attack on September 11 , and set out that the viol@@ ent reaction of the USA moved to a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resol@@ ve this problem is in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his mot@@ ives were good , but he put violence , and that caused an unexpected consequences , &quot; says the Dalai Lama .
four@@ fold increase of consumption of dealer inf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the past 4 years
tox@@ ins control centers in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , sw@@ allowing very alcoholic dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center , the cases of dis@@ inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous agents in children under 12 years exp@@ ires , from 3.@@ 266 to 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children get increasingly common about these products , and sad@@ ly a percentage of them go in the emergency call , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant to drink while some people do to im@@ press her friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
Videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants show only because of a budget of experience .
ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents have re@@ por@@ ous dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth water to preserve a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be angel@@ ized by attractive varieties of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; one child thin@@ ks that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are perf@@ ume .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berries , grapes and orange du@@ ft , which are very appe@@ aling for children .
inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the tox@@ ic@@ not@@ ch centre at the University of Kan@@ sas , Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not let whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four sp@@ lash of inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous san@@ iti@@ zer in the school was brought into a emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult law as dr@@ unken , said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , who treated her in the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when they arrived in the emergency clos@@ e@@ up .
physi@@ ci@@ ans a@@ wait her over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trau@@ ma because the girls fell by the alcohol and had cast their head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very f@@ righ@@ tening , &quot; Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants . store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant out of the child &apos;s range .
beyond alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women were killed in Ontario for women and dis@@ inf@@ ect , containing a toxic , non @-@ declared access .
employee of health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol contained a dead@@ ly solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , used as an ingre@@ dient .
in January , three pupils of the fourth class in the State of New York , their &quot; mo@@ ck &quot; teacher to be poison@@ ed by having anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; so we will report a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished them in their room .
the police regarded the failed plan as &quot; si@@ bl@@ es@@ ling &quot; and wounded discipl@@ inary measures to the school authority .

I don &apos;t believe that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of cover competition in Scottish football long@@ bo@@ red Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ Mid@@ fiel@@ der and the former National Assembly of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest to Celtic people , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an amb@@ assador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what she is interested .
there is a lot of voltage in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only humans in Scotland that want to see these games .
I will turn things around , s@@ wear by De@@ ila .
R@@ onny De@@ ila has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef sw@@ are to turn things .
following the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat of a 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , who now scored a five @-@ point lead , clearly at the top of the standings .
but De@@ ila said : &quot; Celtic had long been bad times , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened .
we feel exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need support , really the support of Celtic because that makes players better .
now together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , whereas it gets in the United Kingdom itself .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom remained as a whole in the same period around 10.000 to 1,@@ 82 million .
the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was from the age of 5.5 % , as the figures of the Office for National Statist@@ ics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell to 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 0,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the year - a figure above the average annual average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
state Secretary for Scotland &apos;s David Mund@@ t comm@@ ented the latest numbers and said , &quot; the long @-@ term plan of government has laid the foundation stone for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly one year ago that Scotland passed the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .

why I will be a Wit@@ ness in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p is ex@@ ec@@ tom@@ ized by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation already took place in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agree .
when the day appro@@ ached , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it &apos;s true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the USA and there are often more applications available to choose which will find a spot@@ less lot@@ tery in order to choose who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media locations from 12 to five .
who is chosen to observe is emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
in addition to Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ ps , I will sit down with Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months of phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we lau@@ gh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a not@@ ebook , a pen that I see .
I just have to try to re@@ mind me of all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma sent me to Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the house , as he wants , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ain about her .
they dre@@ amed that she could have better form@@ ulate &quot; but it still thin@@ ks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p had problem with some of those things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to present an international re@@ porter in order to write there .
when he dies , he consi@@ ders that the public@@ ity work of movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a representative of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the Pod@@ casts series I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certain@@ ty that Richard Gl@@ os@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would ow@@ e him to be a fav@@ ored in fact .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ i@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ porter , which you can turn for this .
what you will get of me is what it means to see a man of un@@ necessary death .

Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards sought him to stop him and threat@@ ening him racing
Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to re@@ install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables by one year , and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aims at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they led a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last straw @-@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moody &apos;s news , Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself found himself on difficult conditions , when it went around the positive co@@ b@@ alt @-@ up trial at Lid@@ aris , which he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ y before and didn &apos;t want it to see &quot; out as too high . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about this , and I have looked for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything coming out at once , &quot; said Moody .
they know that it is far .
sometimes , one respon@@ ds , and one must live with the consequences , and I must live what I said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I would like to circum@@ vent it , and I want to think my owners I try to try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I do not do it , then I should not be more train@@ ers .
I have to over@@ take what I do with my license .
previously , Moody w@@ ished the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had been att@@ empt@@ ing to express its bar@@ n .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going on - and asked him a employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I &apos;m doing in my st@@ ables , &quot; Moody spoke on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a fr@@ aud .
if that is the case , surely you should put yourself to their n@@ oses , because it is trying to gr@@ as@@ p me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ VL , and Bernard Sa@@ unders , President of the R@@ VL , and Bernard Sa@@ unders , former CEO of R@@ VL , were conscious of it now .
should I bring me this to the view that it is personally ?
does the R@@ VL concern themselves apart and might be responsible for people outside of the business , what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think it , that I am .
perhaps they must take me out my license and I have g@@ otten myself away , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
it really makes me sad .
I will practice pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ation levels of the trainer have built up with the long lasting co@@ b@@ alt examination at Lid@@ ari , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led him that he said &quot; he could &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moody , most well known by its preparation by Master Black Caviar , awarded the racing tags @-@ treatment rule &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud , or clay had been played on the horse file , which was pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to assume full responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues lu@@ ck@@ ily applied the leg on the leg .
it could have been so evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday so what was so .
but it had so on the race day too .
Moody could be con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month discount for the treatment with the pack at the racing day . an inquiry of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see a thing we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; Moody said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy describes criticism of the t@@ ack@@ ling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney RO@@ O@@ STER@@ S Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the Ar@@ bit@@ ration rec@@ tif@@ ies the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring batt@@ les &quot; with his team during the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Bennett made a little mirror to the Storm team after his crew had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; pattern of Que@@ ens@@ land not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ le of his crew and said she was just focused on her &quot; contact &quot; at the t@@ ack@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainer ass@@ umes him on his crew , because it was necessary to worry about the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed in our def@@ ensive System or techniques all year . but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les as a real focus , and this has produced the trend for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he &apos;s probably not getting used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock to him .
it &apos;s strange already , as this is always immer@@ sed in this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; attacked and remin@@ ds his ment@@ or remin@@ ded that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; durable &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting soccer .
he was compared to his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a du@@ bi@@ ous purpose .
but now he has a team that can play and let &apos;s watch as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
that is the ball game that you want to play if one has this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like those .
I build more powerful trust in because they say these things because they are a bit wor@@ ried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think of us as it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the Game Storm against RO@@ O@@ STER@@ S has achieved a higher score as the game Bron@@ cos to Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and don &apos;t d@@ ots a bit of tension ?
for me it is the game schem@@ atics .
if they mention us , it means that we will still be meeting in one phase .
the Storm Team is free of this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in advance at the advance ticket at the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales start tomorrow .
Serbian with 200.000 $ deposit to Dro@@ gen@@ an@@ kl@@ age
a man , possibly threat@@ ening a lifetime pun@@ ishment for his tem@@ pt@@ ation in the possession of 40 kil@@ ogram of co@@ ca@@ ine that were sm@@ ug@@ ged to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the Federal Police took over 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , came from South America on V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he found his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life pun@@ ishment for the attempt to poss@@ ess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , it was no evidence that he tried to poss@@ ess the whole quantity and that he could have been a harm@@ less reason .
judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Fl@@ ag@@ an , was wor@@ ried about the river of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
at the same time he re@@ lied on the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step father had provided a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to reach his release .
&quot; after reading the hum@@ ble appoint@@ ments of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Fl@@ ag@@ an .
but that alone will not be enough for him to stop him , he war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and Serbian Pass , a daily start of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g used telephone of girls to block limbs for sending images
a ped@@ agog@@ y used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to call images from child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g picked up the phone of the girl when this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of unexpected pictures from children who were sent from another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it Hog@@ g .
it looked by , found the conf@@ using reports and al@@ arms immediately her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five pictures , analyzed computers , which were found under the address and discovered the &quot; web @-@ research , end@@ itions for the search for un@@ employed images of children .
Hog@@ g predic@@ ted to the offici@@ als that he would have done it , because it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet , &quot; and he then said &apos; to be a polic@@ eman . &quot;
his prosec@@ ut@@ ney Eil@@ id@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ dee Sher@@ iff Court : &quot; he said it would be a dream that he would be ad@@ dic@@ ted to people .
he gave him that the sear@@ ches were done on the computer from him , but did it be to be it because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman w@@ ro@@ ught a g@@ um@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his discussions with the unknown person who sent him the images and he asked to send more photos .
he said he did so to praise her .
he said he was sick in his head , when he drinks and said , he wants to see pictures of r@@ ape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; as the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and at the cry .
they then saw the in@@ consistent pictures on the phone and con@@ fron@@ ted the def@@ end@@ ants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and told that the accused Vi and Play@@ station us@@ used to speak with girls who saw a lot younger than he .
Hog@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded not guilty to the debt of the indictment , in@@ dis@@ continuous images of children on 14 June this year , and not before the trial to be heard on 24 March this year .
the defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked for Hog@@ g doesn &apos;t appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since it was ar@@ gu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his comp@@ ile .
Sher@@ iff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael just w@@ ob@@ serves as ob@@ jection to October to obtain background reports of social work .
Hog@@ g was granted a security deposit in this case , but was kept on temporary det@@ ention because of hearing .
it was taken before the date of decision in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user vari@@ ably on small bound@@ ary pass@@ ages to Germany
more refugees are taken off by the German @-@ Austrian border on the side of the German @-@ Austrian border .
many ve@@ ils originated from fear of discovery and capture the people multi@@ ply on smaller borders .
on the Austrian side , a speaker of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , there were more than 1000 refugees caught in the Land@@ scape Passau and R@@ ott@@ al Inn since Tuesday .
they went on foot over bridges and traffic j@@ acks to the German side .
there they are taken away from the federal police and for@@ warded during the registration .
after the start of the Federal Police near the Munich Central station , there was a significantly more refugees on Wednesday at the start of the trial .
there are around 700 people at the provinc@@ ial capital at 8@@ am , said one speaker in the morning .
following the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ erunner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologist war@@ n in front of storm oils in the southwest of Mit@@ tw@@ o@@ chn@@ ach@@ ia .
due to a gra@@ v@@ ure area on Western Europe , warm sea air curr@@ ents in the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) distributed in Stuttgart .
the vig@@ orous depth is the for@@ erunner of the Tro@@ pen@@ on@@ set &quot; Henry , which was pulled in the past few days from the Atlantic ocean over the Atlantic .
storm@@ s and th@@ under@@ storm@@ s are primarily expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , still until Thursday early in the Black Forest , on the Schwäb@@ ische Al@@ b and in the soil do with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 km / h .
on Friday the sun can look back longer .
the mass makes it : all two years show the car manufacturer at the IAA .
2015 is particularly suitable for a compact car , which is currently particularly well suited for sale .
according to compact class cars , cars from the compact class are especially the required : approximately 28,@@ 1 percent of new reg@@ istr@@ ations ac@@ counted for KRA@@ FT@@ F@@ LIGHT @-@ Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concepts and new luxury cars in this year .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be in autumn with the tra@@ ders .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
he belongs to the nucleus of the brand .
the volume model is also well @-@ sold , the new Astra not@@ ably will not be much more expensive .
Opel organis@@ es a start under@@ ne@@ ath the biggest compet@@ itors VW Golf in the sight , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 990 Euro .
the Astra bo@@ asts a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , H@@ esse also offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which the first three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines also count .
unlike the most important compet@@ itors VW Golf and Ford Focus there are only the fifth generation Opel Astra .
the second version will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA .
and what will be used next to the new compact plant next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ compet@@ itor Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available in a conventional and st@@ aging the GT @-@ version .
it comes to commerce in the beginning of the year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infiniti : all new in the segment is the Infiniti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model I want to find his position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infiniti with its swe@@ eping lines fit in the design line of the brand .
the basic model is powered by a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the model is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp .
the maximum torque is up to 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
Bal@@ eno sales start in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but all around is the compact classic DS 4 compact model that is available at the IAA .
on the outside , the designer of the noble Citro@@ ën offered above all hand at the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system modern@@ izes , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated Ap@@ ples Car@@ play .
on the IAA in compact class , a number of transfers and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI was added to the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human
the Federal Constitutional Court given an ex @-@ in@@ mate to the Te@@ gel judi@@ cial institution , housed in a small cell in a small cell .
because of viol@@ ation of its human dign@@ ity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are in small cells .
this decision of the Federal Constitutional Court has decided in a decision on Wednesday .
according to those concerned , the judges can even hope for money if they were im@@ prisoned for a few days in the strict rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful in Karlsruhe , Germany : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres floor space in Karlsruhe ; the toilet was spati@@ ally dis@@ connected .
after that , the man was once again transferred back to his forest again in a bigger cell .
his rebel@@ lion reported because of the un@@ worthy weather conditions against the land of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Court rendered the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and referred back to the case of renewed ex@@ am .
they see the man &apos;s human dign@@ ity viol@@ ently .
chamber Court decides on the amount of compensation
if for legal reasons of a frag@@ ile reasons only a few days of liability for the compensation , was given an ob@@ jection to it .
otherwise , &quot; it would be a short@@ com@@ er of the legal protection of personality . &quot;
the chamber Court must now clar@@ ify the amount of cash compensation .
the const@@ itu@@ tion@@ ists have often strengthened the rights of pris@@ ion@@ ers in the past .
so they did not believe in April a pris@@ oner of damage because he was locked in a cell in a cell .
according to a decision , according to the majority of 2011 , the majority al@@ location of one cell is projected to separate toilet .
moreover , in addition , Karlsruhe has also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday , who had agreed a de@@ cent accommodation in a parallel attack in November 2009 .
for three months , the time of that time , the Kl@@ äger is accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours in such a cell as in the fall of Karls@@ ru@@ her .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ line in recent weeks also because of lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore included in 23 hours , the cost of agg@@ ress@@ or , even to s@@ om , is to come from the ten@@ se position as a result of the ten@@ se .
according to the judi@@ cial disease in 21 places in Te@@ gel because of young people were not occupied , 19 should be taken away .
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or has decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forec@@ asts of the Austrian Ministry of State , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are to come to Germany after pre@@ diction of Vice ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in Germany even able to record a million refugees .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated due to the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do this . &quot;
what comes to Germany , gives the following overview .
according to different forec@@ asts , between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Health ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the p@@ est@@ le @-@ Institut ) apartments every year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built so far ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dram@@ atically is the lack of living space , but especially with paid rent objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 are out of the rental cost , and in order to apply for these particularly favorable homes .
the Federal Ministry of the Department of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) int@@ ends to double the promotion , from currently 518 millions of dollars to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ le Institute : 80 000 German apartments would have to arise and have to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion euros per year .
scientists and Federal Minister in it agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to the estimates of the Institute for Emp@@ loyment Research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the goods fled to Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , in Germany the refugees in Germany did not have any system@@ atically requested to help them while joining him , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , is crucial whether they find in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation of the application , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the immig@@ rants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ resear@@ cher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the Thr@@ ac@@ hardt , a political discussion was given back in Germany : the job offered for refugees to recogn@@ ise labour .
as early as it was a job offered to asylum seek@@ ers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months as well as the residence of the residence for asylum seek@@ ers .
in society , the sight of the field - mostly the sight into the sight of the workers to facil@@ itate rapid access to the labour market .
lack of knowledge is a great hur@@ dle for access to the job market .
so far , there is still no sufficient offer on general and voc@@ ational language courses .
research also show that work@@ places are most common through personal contact .
the construction of networks is therefore , according to the throne of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the König@@ s@@ weg to work @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ation .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged parents will give their children to the kit@@ es , estimated that ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ ro@@ oted parents , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ y , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate .
in order to con@@ vince the family from the advantages of K@@ ita , managing bal@@ lot distributed in different languages .
if the demand for moving across the large number of refugees grew strongly , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - about by spending more specialist schools .
students without speaking countries will be prepared to classes without knowledge in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by a trained teacher and teacher , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as second language .
there is no lack of def@@ iciency , Be@@ ate St@@ ania tells of the Berlin school administration .
the German student works suggest@@ s that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
basically , no Bundes@@ land seek@@ ers or toler@@ ate the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but has given its position now .
studies at the university could facil@@ it@@ ated access to the university .
because refugees with a resident permit , or Dul@@ ce shall not get any services according to the asylum seek@@ ers , when they start studying .
the latter basically has no BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G as it does not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ r@@ ans persons .
in fact , refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G to be entitled to be short@@ ened from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
however , this financial gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s state Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will play a major role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is an important component of their identity .
the state should be suc@@ c@@ essi@@ v@@ ely in the same rights as they have churches , and the existing state churches demand to develop a new state @-@ relig@@ ions relationship .
also , the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who car@@ es profession@@ ally around the no@@ w@@ ling .
these duties are also part of the rights .
so the representatives of Islam must be clear to some point and willing to cooper@@ ate with the state in many sectors and to make it certain control possibilities .
this also belongs to the will@@ ing@@ ness to take part against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflic@@ ts could also be taken into Germany .
those who would like to have such conflic@@ ts in Germany have left their right to stay here in Germany , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio .
he suggested to transl@@ ate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be in future much more than today a theme for society .
thus the majority of the majority will change , dis@@ assembly of dis@@ cri@@ mination and rac@@ ism is dis@@ closed .
Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions - since a &quot; decade , a non @-@ dis@@ cri@@ mination station and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it is very slow , like the NSU @-@ folders , which system@@ atically igno@@ red the rac@@ ist motif in the police and the authorities .
same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and interests of interests of non @-@ German states are committed to Germany and for what international agreements must be realised in the next few years , if the country peace@@ fully remain and its new citizens must use their possibilities - for the sole of all .
in general , Germany is capable of sup@@ plying medical assistance to date , says Medical President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; as MAN@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , commit@@ ments must flow through money to the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all the deriv@@ atives equal with the registration of health cards .
achie@@ vements could be calculated by the federal states later .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able , so many people meet the restri@@ ctions that seek@@ s the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , physi@@ ci@@ ans make the physi@@ ci@@ ans to blend especially the language bar@@ riers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be more resol@@ ved by mig@@ rants on their ill@@ nesses as other patients .
not only in clinics or in medical practices need to be taken over by dol@@ drums , requ@@ est@@ ing them .
many refugees have also been helping with more common health problems in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugees there is much more un@@ treated dis@@ abilities , and by the young people to know the HIV @-@ en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with some other clinical pictures , German physi@@ ci@@ ans rec@@ all the German physi@@ ci@@ ans become clear , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery said .
&quot; paras@@ ite amb@@ itions or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to identify . &quot; and as for the physi@@ ci@@ ans , it might be even a relief in sight according to the refugees .
the Syri@@ ans would have been a high @-@ developed educational system , some refugees even have been physi@@ ci@@ ans .
in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and determine if necessary .
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany according to estimates of the B@@ und@@ esp@@ otherap@@ ist ammer ( BP t@@ K ) psych@@ ically ill : most suffering under a post@@ pon@@ matic noise disorder or under de@@ pression .
particularly vul@@ ner@@ able are the refuge@@ e sk@@ in@@ der , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the BP@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of TU München shows that each fifth Syrian refuge@@ e camp seem trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
those who suffer from a post@@ gr@@ ati@@ tic resistance does not suffer from so called Flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart sw@@ amps and death tru@@ sts .
more symptoms are sleeping and concentration problems , severe ver@@ aging and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment is necessary , explained am@@ mun@@ ition .
however , only four percent of psych@@ olog@@ ically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
although psych@@ ically ill health seek@@ ers may invol@@ ve an application for Psych@@ otherapy , however , the processing lasts for several months .
moreover , in the social purposes , experts or doctors that are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases are not necessary whether any therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to failure , says Mun@@ z .

Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to dep@@ loy 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of re@@ structuring and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP is split up in two publicly tra@@ ded companies and the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its SERVI@@ CES .
the expected delay reduction resulted in a burden of about 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; this re@@ structuring measures will enable a competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is less and more focused than it is HP today , and we have supported a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business . &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual turnover and is being focused on the provision so far , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , which named Pal@@ o Alto Garage you called &quot; the birth place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive re@@ structuring , to cope with the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb next to the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger st@@ ressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it may be until September and if his re@@ habilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss out at least the next four games for England and due to its history , his stake in the next summer on European Championship is certainly still un@@ certain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere ended up the last season after a separate kne@@ e injury , and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened with her career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it is a bone , which was not well healed .
this is no longer matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in combination with his dum@@ plings , or with the in@@ jur@@ ies that he had before .
this may be true of pure medi@@ cally perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognised , there is the associated risk of other in@@ jur@@ ies , always if a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd recorded 23 different dis@@ orders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of the ar@@ sen@@ als of 157 le@@ ague in the last five play@@ times .
the larger image for Arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League of clubs that have been able to record most vul@@ ner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger acc@@ epts the potential of a vic@@ ious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vul@@ ner@@ ability ratio would last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from injury , you have a reasonable period of time , in which you need to strengthen your body and fight , &quot; he said Wen@@ ger .
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ izes , I am conf@@ ident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way that he deser@@ ves .
Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will join the Rot@@ ation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not only travel@@ ed to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta is able to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ c@@ ott .
&quot; I try to maintain the balance and players who need them to treat a little bre@@ ather break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although sen@@ al clear favour@@ ites are to be passed through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing fields with the largest locking @-@ in effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign in the last season .
the stadium was rock@@ ed by an earthquake on Tuesday , where the Richter scale was stopped .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has pulled out the doctrine of last season with the Champions League sur@@ render to Monaco and has driven away from far hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ ocr@@ al tri@@ umph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ se , &quot; he said wen@@ ger .
it has never worked with ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic to realistic .
we are ambitious but we are no dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gran@@ ts us serious lessons of men of friends
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows are obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever since aw@@ ful as su@@ icide under young males on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than for women .
in the effort to deal with the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a p@@ ile life ) 2015 , with the aim of asking the culture in question to seek aid if they need them .
friendship is the heart piece in battle to master this challenge .
a current study at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms stood firm@@ ly that when suffering an suff@@ ici@@ ently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; had dou@@ b@@ ting its chances of recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of spiritual healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to work for friendship .
in the age of more than social media , with its focus on style on substance , the in@@ fert@@ ility of the answer is often more important than an important event .
our digital life have the need to appear strongly , vi@@ vid and successful , even though in reality the isolation is dominated .
this su@@ perf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ olog@@ ists name is extr@@ ins@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all on costs in@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health .
and how a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can &apos;t really buy .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was on the head .
every character was not defined by his work but by his personality , that sh@@ ines through its interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequently embr@@ aces , Mom@@ ents per@@ su@@ res in hom@@ ely arm@@ chairs and the long@@ ing from Ross to Rachel . all this came from the knowledge that men can look back to definitely to explore completely their feelings .
like a employee of the telephone country , it explained to me ... &quot; my listen@@ ers &apos; role to people who feel de@@ pressed and conf@@ ident , has really showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me if I try to provide long @-@ sc@@ ary mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone to help people in some moments of des@@ pair too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ feast with celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why do you not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k ?
or , even better if you can see in Star@@ bu@@ cks any@@ body alone , give it a smile and say hello to him .
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the whole 236 ep@@ iso@@ des - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help loans to help Malm@@ ö in nar@@ row@@ ly
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani according to his hit in Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut at the Champions League in the Champions League on Tuesday and will help Malm@@ ö in Malm@@ ö .
here are the play report and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain opened his Champions League season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes following the start of his Champions League of Deb@@ ug@@ ts than real @-@ player who brought the French champion in the way , but afterwards she missed a series of occas@@ ions , before they finally increased their lead to the Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ ball@@ tor .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion since it was not only aim@@ ing for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the dogs of the dogs in each of the last three campa@@ igns .
but as she scored points , Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s Team was a long@@ play of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s Team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics . he was later changed to the game against his home town @-@ team and against the association , which he began operations in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or even in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to create and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won &apos;t even though I re@@ gre@@ t that we don &apos;t have achieved either another or two further goals . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury in the Paris @-@ Team , which was held on the weekend . 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was pushed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was referred to as the man called upon the next stage in Europe when he ran into the next month of Manchester United as he ran into the last month of Manchester United before he pushed by Johan Wil@@ and by nicely into the long corner of the network .
but if som@@ eb@@ ody believed that real win would win a great victory , it was dis@@ appointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off , proposed to reach this level , entered at An@@ p@@ iff with nine national wars on the field and was caught up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ area .
but except a shot of Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who joined Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered low in the attack .
instead , PSG itself gave himself up sometimes , with some false pas@@ sports and bad stra@@ ins , not least from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , which was not least sold in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani to re@@ start after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his players into the game , and there was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the planet &apos;s 5th minute ...
the second gate was finally fell short after the hours @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . at Uruguay , his sixth seas@@ onal gate after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had picked up a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this ended all thought that Malm@@ ö could come back into the game , and only an excellent inter@@ ven@@ tions of Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result because substitute players E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi had been recognized a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age H@@ are@@ el , gave to that real class of his team played , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion League game was last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
qualifying plays are not enough . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great play of them !

matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in the film
matt Dam@@ on con@@ fron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown in a discussion on the diversity and said , she will not require behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , who emphas@@ ized the need for alternative per@@ spectives even regarding a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we speak about diversity , then do it at the occupation of the film and not at the line@@ up of the show . &quot;
brown re@@ acted , with offensive un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actors of The Mar@@ tian was le@@ ased .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director who will handle the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown .
the only black person , and it is a Nut@@ te , which is beaten by her white h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere .
the producer of De@@ ar White People developed for fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting right to film ; Dam@@ on knew that their direc@@ ting &quot; could give something that we could not want . &quot;
once the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the Social Media explo@@ ded off Dam@@ age &apos;s comments .
Twitter @-@ User Mr Po@@ oni pushed his che@@ ut over the clip , having wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can clearly explain its diversity - that is SO KNOW that it is hurt . &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 bet@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 sp@@ ikes since its release .
Dam@@ ons comments came at a time when printed representation in media at the top of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the Black L@@ ives &apos; movement achieved freedom of expression and ur@@ ged laws , dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ating practices against colour content .
in February , the singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album silent matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
as books and black life , albums also have their meaning .
in younger time , leaders of the Black L@@ ives published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hat@@ red group .
&quot; the Black L@@ ives &apos; network is a love group , said the leaders .
recently , that Dam@@ on was declared on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ les located to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the west .
if he had accepted the invitation or hit the pop@@ e , is un@@ clear .

&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I never deser@@ ved more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his fo@@ sters of money .
suddenly it &apos;s all .. as I can &apos;t imagine what it is ... the future is unknown .
the director , producer K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood re@@ porter , in order to discuss the final and why , although he finished the course of the par@@ cours , did not get any prize money .
according to the rules the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; when it &apos;s more than one fin@@ alists , it is one of the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said .
how much money is a wonderful price and life , he receives the great grat@@ itude .
I do not think he is wearing a gar@@ bage .
he &apos;s just so happy to have what he did .
he received the masses of awards by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad to Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have just felt as they had performed the ro@@ les .

MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit tiger .
earlier it was one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers are standing in the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , but this part played perfect on Tuesday against the Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .

it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw every game in the bul@@ l@@ tr@@ s of each game , and therefore I want to go into the game .
the designed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rein@@ for@@ ts , its first until mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had played four hits on the Seattle on July 6 .
&quot; he has ch@@ ipping pr@@ er@@ wood well , &quot; said I@@ mus .
he looked good in the ( percussion training ) , clearly better in the bul@@ l@@ ules , and he brought it directly to the game .
with three laps in the background at the end of the seventh month , T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to play .
Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double at the left rim line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bass minister Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Link@@ sh@@ und Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y met wall , the only man who con@@ fron@@ ted in front of the designed Rookie title Miguel S@@ ano , who founded a Two @-@ Run Two @-@ Run .

the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two off@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , which was cancelled before the game of the vul@@ ner@@ ability , after he had been missing for a sp@@ ell over a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;d w@@ ished , &quot; Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt better than I got and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
after doing the first Lead@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Rune in the S@@ cor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single run on the right hand , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he was trying to get the third threat to the third threat .
the Tig@@ ers led the second one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor said .
he has not been well defeated , but he got the right job .
Hug@@ hes was in a pit@@ ch count , and scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the relie@@ ver rec@@ ess A.@@ J.@@ Ach@@ ter .

up to 1,000 refugees can pass up tempor@@ arily .
they should then be distributed to other municip@@ alities .
alone in the past ten days we arrived in H@@ esse with the initial pre@@ sidency of G@@ ießen and 7500 people in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have been set up in sports halls because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
head of the Munich &apos;s security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria .
&quot; I think the wrong thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
he thre@@ w the European countries &quot; collective position . &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup has passed the cup of military invol@@ vement in Germany .
&quot; he has land@@ ed the conflict in front of our door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk .
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called a massive rise in international help for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
nobody explained the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary even now will not be returned .
Germany too has sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; explained it .
according to a agreement , a certain number of refugees from Austria could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , I have given this fest@@ ive talks between the general director for public safety and representatives of Germany .
she was not giving concrete numbers and sp@@ ies on wed@@ nesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balk@@ an route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is to reach Germany usually .
Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colle@@ ague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special offer for next week , together with several other EU leaders .
Germany started with temporary cross @-@ controls on Sunday .
the EU states have not yet come to a joint venture in the crisis .
the EU interior ministers want to take a new arrival to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refuge@@ e sand@@ ran@@ gs in Germany , the Federation will support the country for the first intake and distribution of people .
in cooperation with the countries , Merkel will share the agreement with the Prime Minister &apos;s office in Berlin on the late afternoon eve .
Merkel under@@ p@@ ans , those people susp@@ end protection , they would like to fire this too .
but those who have no be@@ et perspective , could not stay in Germany as well .
this view was dealt with in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or , the state as a whole is now called &quot; enormous power str@@ ing@@ ing . &quot;
thousands of des@@ per@@ ate refugees stuck in the Balk@@ an route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced the border to Romania too , with a fence .
this neighbor@@ ing country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent the t@@ ug@@ boat spread over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new landmark .
the Romanian government convic@@ ted the plan .

the researchers have presented their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; trade journal .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
W@@ ho@@ ever wants to pay attention to its slim line is often bl@@ amed of them .
for man@@ gan@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruit nevertheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C are mainly contain man@@ gan@@ s of vitamin A and its pre@@ amp beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
who e@@ ats the fruits thus as@@ si@@ sts vision , immune system , and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or firm to get rid of .
the color @-@ colour alone does not say anything about how it is ri@@ pe fruit - so green Mang@@ os can taste very delicious .
they should store room temperature and will be consumed within less days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go - but also warm dishes give a special touch .
they mild the slightly bitter taste of some leaf sal@@ ads such as Chic@@ o@@ ree and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

on Wed@@ nes@@ days and night , the F@@ öh@@ n we@@ bin@@ s partly with storm thickness through the p@@ amp@@ ers .
after ir@@ rig@@ ating on Thursday morning , we cross a striking cold front , the powerful ra@@ inf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature return .
as with mete@@ o@@ News in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of a massive deep @-@ pressure spread across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southern exposure .
on the alpine side breaks in the night to Wednesday the spo@@ res through the val@@ leys .
as a consequence , the F@@ öh@@ n has blo@@ wn up to Thursday morning into the p@@ opp@@ ies with go@@ ats from 60 to 100 km / h and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land some 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can be advanced to the adjacent middle of Mitt@@ ell@@ and and in the mountains even arc@@ ades can be reached over 120 km / h .
while in the north on wed@@ nesday &apos;s storm@@ y fer@@ r@@ ages for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the air fatigue begin to build .
this is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , south of the Alps has to be expected in the next 48 hours with some 100 litres of rain per square meter , so that has already been big enough for the last days .
on Thursday morning , the hair pulled off the air in a row a cold front with a strong , partly swe@@ ating rain from west to east on Switzerland .
together with cold front , the wind blo@@ ws considerably through storm@@ y , and temperatures come down considerably .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
after almost 500 years after the Re@@ formation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of City President Ign@@ az@@ io Marino , one of the most well @-@ known square in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill has been christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ form@@ ators .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now hon@@ oured as &quot; German the@@ olog@@ ian &quot; of Re@@ formation . &quot;
the park is right in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the for@@ giv@@ eness had been applied by the Association of Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Lutheran Church in Rome , remember@@ ed that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the pop@@ es were often remember@@ ed for centuries as a minority .
with space I become visible in a symbo@@ lic way , showing the tradition of Christian faith in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ in@@ erm@@ x around the year 1510 / 11 some months in Rome .
he received the city back then as comm@@ ented sin@@ ners .
his negative impressions could therefore best meet him in front of histor@@ ians in his later fight against Rome .
in Luther , then to his Th@@ eses , Luther had directed the split of the Church &apos;s sec@@ ession .
hammer artists invested three years in the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) thorns is one of the main works which have painted Ot@@ mar Old for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now available with magnificent pictures .
in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Old which has form@@ ulated in 150 mot@@ if@@ s of biblical hist@@ ories on paper and canvas in 150 mot@@ if@@ s .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and f@@ anc@@ if@@ ul shapes have received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by far no means is comparable with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the respective themes may seem quite a dark .
for three years Ot@@ mar Old worked on his b@@ ible project for which he has made a sub@@ jec@@ tive artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of the book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote topics such as cruising , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or p@@ ater@@ nity .
so spont@@ aneous , he has fascin@@ ated several partners : this is true for the Luther publisher with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ ost , who identified themselves on the basis of painting with the individual Bib@@ les .
he interpre@@ ts the Bible messages written by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus to Today , in current relations . &quot;
these texts are like ver@@ bal mir@@ rors .
they are embedded in the original Bible itat of Martin Luther and each of a set of artist who form@@ ulates his personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry strip has golden le@@ vers .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old al@@ izes a deep in@@ sight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately born for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 , in Wer@@ n@@ iger@@ ode , born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that listen@@ ed to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter order .
&quot; at this time , education joined the cane , &quot; remin@@ ds of Ot@@ mar Old .
&quot; I have tried to work on this way , perhaps to carry me up with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second concern is to help prove the art in faster time again : &quot; the per@@ c@@ eption of Image Wor@@ lds is character@@ ised by c@@ ranks , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism will be ur@@ ged .
artists have a different desire and wa@@ its to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am an din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
in Ot@@ mar Old , I want to let the viewer into the images , let them work , dis@@ covering and feel that power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post gest@@ ed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &quot; will always have been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst &quot; : &quot; I like how he attacks life with his images . &quot;
I haven &apos;t considered the Bible to be full , but chosen for it , also m@@ yst@@ ical themes .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ mail : &quot; here you can read the pictures , the text just explained . &quot; I was created an image of the Bible .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther Verlag , this work is an invitation to find &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler for both the ( Bib@@ lical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - Paper and screens - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which opens in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation until November 15th .
construction work for BM@@ X rail

that would then be without &quot; further break @-@ up &quot; started with the work during the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , in the weekend a clear sign of the Bundesliga .
the soccer respon@@ ds to the susp@@ end situation in Germany and in politics im@@ posed its help in the manip@@ ulation of the related problems .
&quot; I have the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ union . &quot;
&quot; no one can say no one , that &apos;s nothing at me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; every single needs to get this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B Chief Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 , Berlin , he wants to discuss the refuge@@ e situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the following Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery office and meet the State Minister for Ö@@ zo@@ j@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the topic is sure to play a central role , &quot; announced he .
football could help and wants to help .
but the crucial turn@@ outs should make the politics .
the German S@@ occer League en@@ de@@ compos@@ es its refuge@@ e initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome to four years .
&quot; over the Eg@@ idi@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensure that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; explained N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEFA Cup in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some states support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ban is a clear sign when the Spon@@ sor@@ rel will be held on the left of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ en@@ logos ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; We can help the &quot; Re@@ fuge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen to the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e drama is going to see , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use the federal structure , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence , and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly successful , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
Hoff@@ en@@ heim@@ s General Manager Peter Ret@@ tig talked about a &quot; prominent character &quot; character . &quot;
the national team of Women &apos;s 100 refugees after Halle / Saale inv@@ charges this Friday at this Friday .
N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach promoted the support of refugees as &quot; a large commun@@ e of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ tions have started in their places own projects , be great .
equally great is that small and smallest for@@ war@@ ders are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent is spent in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year , the association will cooper@@ ate with DF@@ B &apos;s choice and federal government with 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; says N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP managing director lose an eye on an accident
Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye on several reports by a fall beginning of July .
after the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he dropped after midnight on a water fro@@ sted , which he took on the left hand , the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost her@@ o@@ ded , then struck out and then drag@@ ged on the road - that he has told us this week . &quot; cited the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; in early October , we will meet ahead of the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager has been working at the meeting and &quot; fully @-@ employed . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ h announced in an interview with the German newspaper &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continues to support the software .
&quot; I &apos;m fully playing for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chair@@ person Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually talks between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to go with such personal history to the public , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everybody can pass so something . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up , when I was down . &quot;
McLaren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ ussen except skir@@ mish at ...

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Krasno@@ dar : turn@@ key in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all ho@@ pes raised to a com@@ eb@@ ack of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of play in the Europa League .
the national gam@@ bler will also be missing in Du@@ el with the CC Krasno@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot take back to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel am Wednesday .
if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga @-@ Top play against Le@@ verk@@ usen . &quot; we expect the B@@ VB @-@ Coach : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ chel is not only changing to the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the go@@ al@@ arms position .
therefore Roman We@@ iden@@ f@@ eller takes the place of G@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains on an absolute top level , &quot; the world soccer team deser@@ ved the world champion .
but if the iden@@ f@@ eller in the future is used in all European League Games , Tu@@ ck@@ les left side open .
he will also spread the second portion with a high prob@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is not so wrong with Julian We@@ ig@@ l . &quot; so that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to retri@@ eve the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ cars : government wants to lead to Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany will be the goal of the vehicle technological advance .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet concluded a strategy document from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) which under@@ looks investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke at the edge of the Autom@@ esse International Motor Show in Frankfurt on Wednesday in Frankfurt .
automated and net@@ worked driving will increase the traffic safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G7 states that will also come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategic character of the Austrian Ministry emphas@@ izes the importance of mobile broad@@ band extension and an excellent conversion to digital listening radio .
the new technology is currently testing a test track on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so in Germany , Germany wants to use itself internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the federal government also plans to use a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees humans as a driver .
during automated driving over , the car becomes the lead , the driver becomes more and more for passenger .
technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which process the environment and process the data in seconds .
after a study conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , this automated driving will be techn@@ ically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
yet , wireless vehicles are to be expected in public roads as far as far as 2020 . &quot;
the authors of the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site also estimate the authors of the study by 2025 on around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said the SPD road expert S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l .
but the matter of liability in acc@@ idents and security of the personal data of the driver must be clar@@ ified clearly .
yet the Germans are still sc@@ ep@@ tical and sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or the Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA survey on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute consi@@ ders that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will continue to prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent are only expected to believe in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ d@@ ents are counting by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the USA .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of a bit of digital car@@ coma , only seven percent would agree to give control during all the roads across the streets .
on the free@@ way , this could rise to 15 percent in the flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
well each Four@@ th would leave the car under no circumstances .

it is a mix of great fashion show and a wax@@ works of Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .

for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From Bür@@ g@@ erst@@ e@@ ig to the cat@@ walk ) , it is a luck that the fashion pot@@ ter has changed his first lo@@ wering post@@ ure towards a show about his person .
&quot; if he had been an exhibition , he said , &quot; He said , &quot; He said , &quot; He said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener point as fashion n@@ iche
we used to make the long nitrogen machines in and around pl@@ a@@ vers , about driving meters .
the embro@@ idered fabri@@ cs and points were produced in large quantities for customers who they processed for instance at ce@@ il@@ ings and she@@ er .
this alone today doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the Mo@@ vers@@ itze Pl@@ auen .
instead the mode is important .
in the beginning of the pl@@ au@@ ener leader , fashion played a major role , then was pushed by home textile industry and is now re@@ discovered as n@@ iche .
Rein@@ hardt has some examples : tip in je@@ wellery , accessories such as pockets and for regional trains .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion seems to have an increasing client potential in the past .
those who operate in the textiles industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
they already make half of the orders already .
Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen together with nine other companies is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener summit and stal@@ ks .
only they are allowed to carry the registered label .
over the past 15 years , about 80 percent of sales are proce@@ eded .
private specialized shops and also the whol@@ es@@ ale there is almost no more .
our products can hardly reach our customers on this way .
today , the mass of mass is produced in Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively sold via chains .
also , we@@ aker of export , currently according to Russia and in the US .
are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Embro@@ ider@@ y in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; this year we introduce a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ olog@@ ically and soci@@ ally toler@@ ated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt completed : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
her diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the West@@ s@@ Sax@@ on University Zw@@ ick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on bul@@ l@@ r@@ ots and tips .
in order to find a little closer to the competition from Asian Space , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
there is a voltage drop between the h@@ ipp@@ est ideas of designers and the companies which have to think of particularly econom@@ ically , &quot; Schmidt is said .
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to hold a customer base .
several years ago , Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter rela@@ unch the historic snow tip of Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter &apos;s historic snow@@ ball .
the machine sends small co@@ ws at some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schm@@ ie@@ de@@ meister@@ in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ zer was inspired by it : &quot; before I was not able to start with traditional plans . &quot;
now they use the snow tip for their jewelry .
in a complex process , they represent the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos; - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to clients whose ancest@@ ors have lived in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding which would like to have a reminder .
with this I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener leader .

the economy has to open a wider ou@@ tw@@ ard outside to fo@@ ster growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday a group that was instru@@ cted to reform the reform .
&quot; China should use itself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ne@@ ug@@ r@@ allies to promote and re@@ forms promote new moment@@ um and vit@@ ality will bring and bring new place to economic growth , said Xi .
the leadership group has adopted a range of guidelines , including a negative list for the coverage of the market access , relaxation of the border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants of Mel@@ de@@ c .
following the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies are not identified in question .
the system is gradually tested and improved through test programs .
the initiative is important , since it as@@ si@@ sts the market a greater role in the al@@ location of resources , a leg@@ itim@@ ate business area provided and open the market , said the statement .
the government will also ease access to the companies and ensure that company will decide how they lead their business .
the statement also said that China will allow remote regions to integrate new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the scope of a offer , state @-@ controlled sectors will open further fields for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limits in pre@@ domin@@ ance
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large quantities and consumption by a significantly higher dose of ner@@ ves .
the consumer organization Foo@@ d@@ Watch , which is a spokes@@ person on the EU &apos;s working paper , critic@@ ised the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side effects missing industrial and environmental policy will be for@@ warded with full impact of pregnant and lo@@ d@@ dl@@ ers , &quot; stated by Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from Foo@@ d@@ Watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to be added to the bound@@ ary values of the ner@@ ves for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Ha@@ i- or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from a kil@@ ogram of mer@@ cury in each kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors already be so strong with mer@@ cury that can not be sold on the basis of the limit values about 50 per cent of the length .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be im@@ bur@@ sed .
according to Foo@@ d@@ Watch , the EU is aim@@ ing to elim@@ inate the limit values in other fish at the moment 0,5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram .
Foo@@ d@@ Watch described this as &quot; Tri@@ ck &quot; because smaller skill fish , such as car@@ p are usually recommended so low that they already with@@ stand the maximum value today .
the absence of mis@@ ery is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de shelf man@@ eu@@ ver that helps alone the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
Mercury is a high @-@ poison@@ ous heavy metal that is strongly flo@@ ur@@ red about the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory .
the federal government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; small quantities are especially able to cause damage to the ner@@ vous system .
the Federal Ministry of Environment explains to its website with regard to the applicable maximum value , that a &quot; health concern of the general population &quot; is not expected .
Mercury can be found mainly through coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written confirmation by the German Federal Ministry of Health , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock ordered more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the German Federal Ministry of Health , two thir@@ ds of the total volume in Germany .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube be &quot; permanent and nation@@ wide dec@@ ay , &quot; the &quot; Mir@@ ror &quot; had been cited in March from the paper .
last year , war@@ nings before mer@@ cury in fish are already the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
