the securing measures according to this agreement will end in relation to the core material , when the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or diluted in a way that it is not suitable for a nuclear job , which is not more usable or practically non re@@ cover@@ able .
the community provided for the purpose of this agreement , pursuant to the Convention on Nuclear Material from the states , which is subject to securing measures according to this agreement .
the securing measures according to this agreement will end in respect of nuclear material as soon as the recipient is planned , as in this agreement the responsibility has taken over .
the organization leads documents from which each passing and if necessary , the re@@ use of the backup action on the further core material is highlighted .
however , core material , which are subject to the Convention according to this Convention , is to be used with non @-@ nuclear activities such as production of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agreed the community with the organization of such uti@@ lization of material , under which circumstances may be termin@@ ated in relation to this material .
II ) To use the not@@ ion during the duration of non @-@ application to this Convention not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bomb .
B ) The organization and the community meet a provision that the use in this agreement will only be used as long as the core material is used for such activity .
in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances must not be applied .
in any case , the backup policy will again be applied again as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear job .
the organisation will be held on the quantity and composition of this material in the relevant state or the relevant States affected by this state or states on this state or by these states .
this explains the agreement as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporary and neg@@ ligent provisions and dis@@ abling for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a hidden knowledge of the military activity , and does not refer to the following use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the States carry out the costs involved in each of their obligations arising from this agreement .
if the community , the states or persons , are subject to their territories , however , extraordinary costs due to a special search of the organisation , the organisation reimbur@@ ses this cost , if it has agreed ahead in advance .
in each case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling which will be demanded by the inspec@@ tors .
the Community and the states are sure that the liability &apos;s liability for nuclear damages , including any insurance or other financial security , according to their laws or other financial security , may be applied to the organisation and its officials for the purposes of implementing this agreement in the same way as on the nationality of the states .
each claim to claim the community or state against the organization or the organisation of the organization or the organisation of any damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear strike , which resulted from the implementation of the securing measures according to this agreement , will be regulated in accordance with international law .
if the Council is in@@ sist@@ ed by checking the expert information that the organisation has not been able to verify itself by checking account , so that he may reimbur@@ se any nuclear weapons according to this Convention , so he can report to the articles intended in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the statutes , and if necessary , take the respective measures taken place .
in such steps , the Council considers to be at@@ tained in which mass was achieved by the used safety measures , and the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties has been affected - each representing an opportunity to give the council the necessary safety .
to determine the organisation , the community or state , consultations on issues , which arise from the design or application of this agreement .
the Community and the states are entitled to determine that any questions arising from the design or application of this agreement will be verified by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to take part in the council of such questions through the Council .

the purpose of this part of the agreement is to specify how to carry out the provisions of the part I via securing measures as required .
the goal of safegu@@ arding the securing measures in this agreement is the timely discovery of nuclear weapons for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bomb explo@@ sives as well as the deter@@ rent of such a branch by risk of premature discovery .
to en@@ rich@@ ness of the objectives specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a backup measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial input and observation as important supple@@ mentary measures .
technical conclusion of the au@@ dits by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for any material range , which is not listed for a specific period , with indication of the accuracy limits for the specified sea level .
in performing their au@@ dits , the organisation after article 3 makes a full use of the backup system of the community .
accounting and control system of the Community for core material under this Convention is based on a breakdown in material zones .
when applying their backup policy , the community of de procedure and measures will make use of the following manner , and it is necessary to see how they are closer and useful in comple@@ ment@@ ing agreements :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserv@@ ative , delivered , lost , lost or in other ways out of stock and stock levels ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and estim@@ ation of measurement un@@ certainty ;
C ) Method of determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and receivers ;
e ) method of assessment of accumulation does not be measured and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system , which provides for every material zone zone the core material and the changes of the material zone including the one and outputs of the material image zone ;
( g ) precau@@ tions that make sure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proce@@ dures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organisation in accordance with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 @-@ 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement will not extend to material in the mining or in the ore processing .
( B ) The phase of the nucle@@ us or th@@ ori@@ ental material , which is not yet reached under letter ( c ) , is introduced in the states , the community of the organisation divi@@ des the amount and composition of the material , if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) The core material , which is suitable according to composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , in which it is manufactured , or will be established this core material or else , in a later stage of the nuclear circular body produced in the United States , so it is subject to the others in this Convention .
a ) The purposes intended for use in this agreement will not be completed for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions are not allowed in accordance with the conditions specified in Article 11 , the union is not possible , so consult the organisation and the community for the use of appropriate safety measures .
B ) The security measures taken in this agreement will end for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , so that the organization and community agree that this core material is practically non re@@ cover@@ able .
for the purpose of the Community the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures according to this agreement :
a ) Spec@@ ific material , when used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , when used at non @-@ nuclear activities in Article 13 if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an Is@@ ot@@ open@@ concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is about 80 % .
in search of the community , the organization is exemp@@ t from the organization core material , which otherwise would be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , if the entire , based on this article in the states has liberated nuclear materi@@ al@@ os at no time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural grain , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of the en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and rounded urine with an accumulation of more than 0,@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0,@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or less ;
should a free core material together with core material , which are subject to the securing measures according to this Convention , will be processed or stored , such precau@@ tions for re@@ use of the backup action on that material .
the community meets additional agreements , which are necessary in the extent that are necessary for the successful and effective revival of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention , in particular , as the procedures set out in the Convention .
the comple@@ ment@@ ing agreements may be extended or amended without any change in agreement between the organization and the community .
the comple@@ ment@@ ing agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement in force . the organization , the Community and the States are able to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement . an extension of this period must be between the organization , the community and the states .
the organisation is based on the basis of the analysis of this agreement on the basis of this agreement on the basis of the fundamental core material in the States , regardless of its origin , resulting from the following reports and results of their au@@ dits .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxemburg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) .
in ER@@ IL@@ ER@@ UNG NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER reasons - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special agreement concluded on the conference for international economic cooperation with low income , whose development is ob@@ stru@@ cted by general resources transfer problems .
C ) It is the purpose of the EEC and Member States that the whole of the member states are bound to entry into force within six months and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do their potential to achieve that goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organization have cons@@ ulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the medium bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the context of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC Commission has presented a table which is inten@@ tionally intended to apply the criteria defined in this agreement -
the organization establ@@ ishes a special account under the name &quot; Special ac@@ tionary account &quot; which is made from the Member States to the special ac@@ tionary account ; this account is called as Administrator @-@ hanging and ( in this capacity the organization is defined as &quot; Administrator &quot; ) , and in accordance with the provisions specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special shareholders account will be separately and separated from all other accounts and activ@@ ates .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : ( a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest debt of the member state that will pay upon request in the question of the organization as an administrator of the special shareholders and the organisation of the organisation in the respective country .
B ) The payment is made in two rati@@ os , namely , the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . of the entry within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the time ;
II ) the second amount of the balance of the article on January 1 , 1979 or at a different time that was agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget .
C ) Every member state shall be made available to payments before the dates mentioned above .
the car@@ et@@ akers , according to the usual method of organization , takes about proportional pulling to the cash or the debt of debt to cover the expenses for the special issue loans and compens@@ ate the special account account in an appropriate manner .
in the gran@@ ting of this loan , the car@@ et@@ akers can lead to the conditions of the EEC by the following factors :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the present and se@@ eable economic problems in the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of debt service in the country and its further credit@@ ation capacity to loan conditions without payments ; and
VII ) The circum@@ ference in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
any special loan loan is to finance the financing of a clear risk program or forward , regardless of whether it is to be approved and managed by the organis@@ ing program of the organization or not , according to the procedure and practices , which is deemed to be approved and managed by the amend@@ ment of the organization financed by the Organization ( b ) of the Pre@@ am@@ ble for this agreement .
the funds of the special shareholders may not be used instead of a regular funding of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the bank or the organization on the day of entry into force of the bank or the organization .
apart from section 4 , special loan loans are subject to the same withdrawal terms , which are generally valid for the organization stip@@ ulation in the organization ; they are thus refundable at ten years of age in 50 years .
special funds are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts to payment of this prayer box are directly to the organization that re@@ tains them .
each special loan contract is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the Administrator , in particular the origin of the funds .
the revenue from each special transaction loan may be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient or for goods or services which are made ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organisation , and according to what the car@@ et@@ aker has set to have , recip@@ i@@ ents of a special issue .
cash payments of special transaction loans are to be issued on the special shareholders account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be back as soon as possible from the administrator to the respective member state .
the administrator teaches until the completion of all special transaction loans in the EEC on the verification carried out by the directors approved in preparation by the directors approved by the directors of directors and programmes .
during the time of the payout Per@@ es , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special agreements and the expenses made for this .
as soon as possible , the administrator convey@@ s the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the business year of an organisation with an opinion on external audit@@ or from the organization to this account .
after full payment of the special loan coverage , the Administrator of the EEC sends as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects financed by the special shareholders account .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and runs suitable recordings and reck@@ oning , from which the contributions to the special ac@@ tionary account that deposited on the account and paid out of the account amounts paid out of the account and the payments to the Member States .
the EEC and the Administrator work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Manager up to the complete edition of the special edition account from time to time exchange ideas or projects , and over all other issues related to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is signed on 31 December 1978 or at a later date given by the EEC and the Organization if necessary , the agreement and all the comm@@ it@@ ments of the parties shall be due to immediate effect .
if the total capital amount of all agreements taken by the recipient in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement shall be reimbur@@ sed in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement , the agreement and all the comm@@ it@@ ments of the parties shall be concluded with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the legal regulations of each party .
governments of the Member States not@@ ices the secre@@ t@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Secret@@ ariat of Secret@@ ariat also guides these not@@ ifications together with an Not@@ ification of the legal approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement is effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned not@@ ifications during the organisation .
this agreement has been resolved in two languages in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch .
considering that the agreement concluded in the form of an exchange change for the amend@@ ment of the App@@ endi@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , the following regulation is passed :
between the European Atom@@ ic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled core fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs
the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Association , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after , &quot; Commission . &quot;
and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Coun@@ cill@@ or , &quot;
this program covers the creation of a great testing facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation a Common Company after chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - is referred to - herein@@ after called &quot; Common Company J@@ ET . &quot;
for several years , Switzerland deals with research in the field of controlled core fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs and is perfectly familiar with the area concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this agreement should be able to avoid any contra@@ cting party in the area of controlled core fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs for the mutual research use , and accordingly , the common objective of this research work , d.@@ h . the cost @-@ effective electricity production by using the controlled core action reaction to achieve faster .
to achieve the aim of this agreement , the contra@@ cting parties associated with App@@ endi@@ x I and II of this agreement are called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme , &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
to ensure a effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over the long term targets and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom program ; it is changed or changed after checking through the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of this agreement , which may include new activities related to the Eur@@ atom program .
every time the contra@@ cting parties accept a new program , this is the part of the Programs I and II listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the Associ@@ ated Association conven@@ ed by : - An appropriate participation of each of the contra@@ cting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ;

agreement in the form of a letter change between the European Economic Community and Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States in the framework of medium @-@ term financial support
the BIS could include Stand@@ by @-@ Credit agreements with central banks of the credit@@ ors when banks provide an appropriate request .
the agreements could be closed by the total amount of the membership fee paid by the credit@@ or , and within a total limits of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invoice units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery institutions of the member countries .
but now some conditions are mentioned , however , to which application the BIS would be ready for use .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without having passed a total of five years .
with the opening of loans , as well as their extended extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , the first pulling will not be made before the conclusion of a month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so the Bank can make the required custom@@ iz@@ ations of their own liqui@@ dity .
the provision would be made available in the BIS when the agreement is available at the disposal of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to time span which would be carried out into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who apply the BIS to the particular date under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely comply with the market rates .
however , if the BIS has to proc@@ ure the necessary resources themselves on the market , then the interest rate could reach a maximum which corresponds to an increased margin of Libor .
I would be thank@@ ful if you would share the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

I invo@@ ke me to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to the integration of H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb , and goat meat from New Zealand into the community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organization for H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb , and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep &apos;s economy and the exp@@ ortation of H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ meat after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand @-@ Rural H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb is not imp@@ aired on these markets , I am entitled to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or frozen hamm@@ ers - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ;
after this agreement , New Zealand will be ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat to the market of the community in the amount specified in the treaty .
new Zealand gets the assurance that the normal paragraph of its H@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure a perfect function of the agreement , New Zealand is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the quantity delivered in the actual quantity does not exceed the set amount .
the specified quantities are made in the traditional offer form ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community as@@ sures that New Zealand cannot be hin@@ dered with this agreement , to use new technological developments , or maintain its competitive position on the market of community .
should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trading are possible , so consult the two parties to find such a change in the clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protective clause in demand to protect themselves from this agreement to protect New Zealand &apos;s interests .
in the event that the imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to expos@@ e the imports from that country .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaust@@ ion of products derived from this agreement to a test@@ ament of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ o@@ rem to limit .
with new member states , the community in consultation with New Zealand changes in clause 2 fixed amounts according to the scope of New Zealand trade with every new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this will be taken into clause 5 of the post @-@ mentioned request of the cancellation .
the total volume in clause 2 is fixed with the day of the accession of Greece to the community at 245 500 tons of animal body weight .
the community takes everything to avoid market development which could imp@@ air the normal paragraph of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ates on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of intervention volumes on frozen meat is not under@@ mining this goal .
in addition , the two parties undertake to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ le@@ isch in the community without danger for the market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that every actual application of subst@@ it@@ ments or other funding is made for the exp@@ ulsion of H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ers only at prices and conditions , which reflect existing international obligations and consider the traditional share of community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand warran@@ ts the observ@@ ance of the quantities mentioned in clause 2 of particular , that there are no export license beyond these quantities .
the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import license is made depending on the items mentioned in New Zealand by the issue of a export license defined by the New Zealand government .
details for the application of this system are defined so that on the position of a security deposit may be disp@@ uted for the issu@@ ance of the import license .
in implementing provisions , the competent jurisdiction of the competent authority of the relevant authority of the Community in regular intervals shall be indicated for the export license ; these details may be specified in accordance with identification cards .
the Committee carries out that the agreement will be properly applied and smoothly .
the Committee regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and the ho@@ ist market of the two parties and on the world market and the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified in clause 7 .
the Committee does not worry , that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by having products made from H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb , and goat meat under the agreement cannot be carried out after the community .
the Committee will discuss all questions concerning the implementation of the agreement , which will be submitted by a contra@@ cting party , and advis@@ es appropriate solutions to the relevant authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply ind@@ es@@ fully to the rights and obligations of the contra@@ cting party within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the set @-@ set date set applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December . starting from the entry into force of this agreement , the amount specified by the entry into force is set to 1 . January of the subsequent year .
this agreement applies to the areas where the contract is being applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and according to this contract , on the other hand as well as for the main New Ze@@ al@@ ands .
this agreement will enter into force on 20 October 1980 . after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contra@@ cting party to termin@@ ate it by a year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by a year prior to 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider for necessary .
I am able to propose that if your government may agree to the fore@@ front that this writing and your response contra@@ sts together an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area .
&quot; I commit to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set out provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb , and goat meat from New Zealand into the community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organization for H@@ amm@@ el , Lamb , and goat meat .

the volume of red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) is indicated on the label .
all processes required for manufacturing must be done under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the control must be done using a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively through pressure .
if an artificial solution has been added , the label also has its volume and composition .
the human dr@@ plasma is extracted by de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid that relies upon cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging or sedi@@ ments of human blood .
the human dr@@ plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method , by which a den@@ ig@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
the dry product is easily dissolved in a water amount , which corresponds to the liquid volume , from which one went out in producing the substance .
protein concentration of the so gained solution should not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution must not have visible signs of ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) a dangerous salary at Is@@ oh@@ äm@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ os@@ yn@@ in@@ ine have been established are to be excluded .
