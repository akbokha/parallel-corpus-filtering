the present document is a summary of the European Public Consult@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which it is explained as the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the pack of packages ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ ling thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , mist@@ rust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder , alternat@@ ely have abnormal atmosphere ( periods of abnormal atmosphere ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for treating moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , solution to intake or melting tablets can be applied in patients with the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works above all as &quot; partial Ag@@ ents &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin can play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby decreasing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , re@@ sem@@ bling the symptoms occur , has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which were at gest@@ ed un@@ rest , compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which have been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms have been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which compared to increased un@@ rest , associated with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients showed a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to take absor@@ bs ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution of patients who received the Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms caused more un@@ rest than patients receiving a placebo .
when applying the bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was reduced in four of the five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks when placebo was able to re@@ produce man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms caused by un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , ac@@ idi@@ dy@@ nia ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , ac@@ idi@@ fication ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , s@@ lap ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , memory @-@ hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increase in memory ) , fatigue and exhaust@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes , with which the man@@ ic episodes spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , against the risks .
in addition , the Committee also came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to su@@ stain the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a therapeutic or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to greater sensitivity of these patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered in consideration when clinical factors just@@ ify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ ra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ des behavi@@ oral behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic in epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder showed no increased su@@ ici@@ ality of risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with care in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ra@@ zo@@ l occurring dy@@ nasty .
if patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis should be drawn into consideration , decrease the dose or break treatment .
if a patient signs signs and symptoms resulting in a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all Anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ans in the an@@ am@@ o@@ zo@@ a or at states that are related to var@@ ic@@ ans in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , increased death in comparison to placebo .
there were however in some of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases , extrem@@ ly and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ one or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related unwanted events in patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , which allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with Bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , resp@@ . an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with over@@ laid side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have to be made .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 will result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible metabol@@ ites .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should su@@ stain the potential risks for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore should make similar dose reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dos@@ ing of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the dos@@ ing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
in common with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be used with a moderate increase of arith@@ me@@ tic concentration .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl / 3 @-@ method@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl ) .
patients should be advised to notify her doctor if pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the in@@ sufficient data situation for the safety of the human being and because of the concerns in the animal &apos;s concerns , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against operated hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no adverse influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than either placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
the incidence of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia were compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % were in patients under placebo .
in another long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , y@@ ielded no medical differences .
enh@@ ancements in C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with arith@@ me@@ tic patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
in addition to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ or syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ akia , and increased mortality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch were un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate over@@ dose associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with an estimated content of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ ost@@ sis in treating a over@@ dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of use , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma attachment .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a partial prot@@ agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor is convey@@ ed .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent reduction in the li@@ aison of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ament , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ ting .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statist@@ ically significantly stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , in week 52 the share of the respon@@ dence was similar to the study medication , similar to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions @-@ scale , showed significantly stronger recovery than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % were found under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients underwent a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . 30 % ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in week , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a similar share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania , such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which was partially transmitted to Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy , with a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to the Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period above 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who showed a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in front of the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the mania .
based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l which is cat@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
the median ste@@ am@@ ation time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l for exten@@ sible metabol@@ ites on CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients have no sexually dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics found no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ nic@@ ity or the effect of smoking at the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney disease in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with various abnormal liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for petrol @-@ balanced potential , the pre @-@ clinical data recogni@@ zes no particular dangers for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed merely by dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dos@@ ing or exposure of people , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects resulted in a dos@@ is@@ depen@@ dency channel ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the recommended maximum dose of humans ) and an increase by conc@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ al gland / car@@ cin@@ oma during female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times of the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when people are recommended ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ ids of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations in human g@@ all found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. of found concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in G@@ alle of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rabbits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages resulting in expres@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold in the middle bar @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports of the Dy@@ na@@ in@@ esia treatment .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases , extrem@@ ly and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ one or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related unwanted events in patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , which allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .

man@@ ic episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a partial prot@@ agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor is convey@@ ed .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients underwent a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . 30 % ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ age study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in a tablet form of healthy volunteers , the relationship between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max thickness of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Extra@@ ct was found in cholesterol as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ ices of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3@@ times of the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rabbits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages resulting in expres@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold in the middle bar @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be completed with Ari@@ a zo@@ l injection solution and to the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
to minimize the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle underneath b@@ yp@@ assing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status which is already used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced oral treatment is inde@@ xed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the features of the medicine associated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y fibre tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to take .
there are no tests for efficacy of Ari@@ a zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ veness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in addition to a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ ra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in relation to extreme gra@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on safety and effectiveness of arith@@ me@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or Drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with care in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports of the Dy@@ na@@ in@@ esia treatment .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing level of consciousness and signs autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regul@@ ating pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar govern@@ ance , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless the intensity of the Sed@@ an was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) was used as one @-@ time in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , like I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore should make similar dose reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dos@@ ing of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the dos@@ ing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received the intensity of the Sed@@ an , compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following adverse events have occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ ra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
the incidence of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects appeared more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were listed in clinical trials with oral @-@ consuming Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as possible medical @-@ relevant effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % were in patients under placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , y@@ ielded no medical differences .
enh@@ ancements in C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with arith@@ me@@ tic patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
in addition to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ or syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ akia , and increased mortality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was compared with statist@@ ically significantly larger improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with Bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ ra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statist@@ ically significant improvement in the symptoms and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar effectiveness was observed in terms of total population , but an statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( or@@ ally ) showed a statist@@ ically significantly stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , in week 52 the share of the respon@@ dence was similar to the study medication , similar to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( or@@ ally ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sions @-@ scale , showed significantly more powerful improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , it showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( or@@ ally ) group and at 57 % of placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients underwent a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 % compared with an average weight of approx . 5 % ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which was partially covered on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy , with a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to the Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study from a 74 @-@ week study before Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the mania .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly injection 90 % higher than AU@@ C according to the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma curve at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ a zo@@ l injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys well toler@@ ated and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target according to repeated treatment in system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies for the reproduction level of intraven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concern for maternal exposure , which lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rabbits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( or@@ ally ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for petrol @-@ balanced potential , the pre @-@ clinical data recogni@@ zes no particular dangers for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed merely by dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dos@@ ing or exposure of people , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects resulted in a dos@@ is@@ depen@@ dency channel ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the recommended maximum dose of humans ) and an increase by tri@@ but@@ en@@ al rin@@ ds / car@@ cin@@ oma during female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the middle bar Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when humans are recommended ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the middle bar Ste@@ ady state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose dose or from 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rabbits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages resulting in Ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier an anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line had received .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients that have a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine .
considering the patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines for the first time due to deteri@@ oration of disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously obtained other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine .
it may also not be applied to people who have the breast or before the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood .
the drug Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) proves that Abra@@ x@@ ane was unable to treat patients that the first treatment was not more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , drug may not be used to decrease side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited author@@ izes a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line @-@ contained therapy is not displayed ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ er number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is subject to inter@@ rupt until a improvement is achieved at level 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is no sufficient data for the recommendation of Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ t@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function , and there is no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to not sufficient data for harm@@ less@@ ness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ arti@@ fic@@ t@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could be considerably more pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be instit@@ uted , and the patient must not be treated again with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patient , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cyc@@ line has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly union with Abra@@ x@@ ane in connection above kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity was not proven , me@@ di@@ ale inci@@ dents are not unusual in the inde@@ xed patient collective , particularly in patients with earlier anthrop@@ cyc@@ line treatment or lung disease or lung disease .
if patients suffer from Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and constant means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in a low age that does not practice any effective conception , except the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is imper@@ ative .
women in poor age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contra@@ cep@@ tive method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is stim@@ ulated , during and up to six months after treatment no child to test@@ ify .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment of sper@@ mac@@ ular con@@ serv@@ icing due to the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of an ir@@ reversible infer@@ tility exists .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the ability of transport and ability to serve machines .
listed below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects , which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in piv@@ ot@@ al clinical phase III study .
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most prominent important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ ing ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed with 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects are listed , which occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy during each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ un@@ cture hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
Dy@@ spher@@ ag@@ ie , bl@@ acks , tongue burning , dry mouth , p@@ ains of g@@ ums , loose sto@@ ols , t@@ ul@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , pain in the lower body , or@@ ale pain , re@@ oct@@ al bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the breast @-@ wall , weakness of muscles , abdominal pain , pain @-@ pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ eton muscles , f@@ ooth@@ ills , dis@@ comfort in the limbs , muscular weakness .
rest@@ less@@ ness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules drug , which promotes the con@@ dens@@ ation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tubes and the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules stabili@@ zed by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is well known that alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of Plasma components in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ ume recept@@ ors and due to the alb@@ umin@@ bic protein SP@@ ARC ( p@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation appears in the area of the tum@@ our .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ cen@@ sored studies and of 4@@ 54 patients that were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparison study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , either in the form of sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 , as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in inclusion in the study 64 % of the patients had an imp@@ aired public condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ asia .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy yet , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for general response rate and time up to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity vs Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement in a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy an periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 was evaluated .
the natural process of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for demol@@ ition on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 @-@ 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 As an intraven@@ ous gift from Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased from multi @-@ phase plasma .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has an extensive out@@ trav@@ ascular supply and / or inc@@ line binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after a sol@@ vent containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane Higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue @-@ coating is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and into two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value of the un@@ altered drugs amounted to 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , resulting in an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
over the age of more than 75 years , however , only few data are available , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was tested at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and above all light light protected over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ car@@ cin@@ ogenic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be careful when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe , it is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) So@@ dium chloride in@@ fusion solution .
after the complete en@@ core of the solution the det@@ ach@@ ment bottle should be at least 5 minutes to ensure a good benefit of the solid material .
then the drain bottle should be slow for at least 2 minutes and gently and / or revers@@ ed until a complete re@@ board of the powder is done .
if as@@ semblies or sin@@ ks are visible , the flow bottle must be revers@@ ed once again in order to achieve a complete re@@ board prior to the application .
the exact dos@@ ing volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated and the corresponding quantity of the re@@ constit@@ uted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected in an empty , ster@@ ile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

• Education brochure • Sum@@ mary of the features of the medicine ( subject @-@ information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging lines . • With unique imaging of the correct application of the product acci@@ dental cooling boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood ir@@ radiation which may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if the surgery is not possible prior to the procedure , and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases affecting the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made by the patient or staff member unless they have received an appropriate manual .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency and in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ars should always be at the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that there is no iron defic@@ iency , and ice energy agents should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients suffering from chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ defic@@ iency or thus , that the body does not adequ@@ ately address the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell produced in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was diagnosed as an injection in a V@@ ene as part of a main study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
in all patients participating in this study , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ars between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
furthermore , the company also filed the results of a study in which the effects of inj@@ ected ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined by those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison to this , patients who continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , per@@ v@@ ous mig@@ raine and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed cannot be applied in patients that may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that they are caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , was established in accordance with the provisions of the European Union .
the company , which presents Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on the medical expert in all Member States , including information about the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce medicine P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , a permit for the transport of se@@ ash@@ ore throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of transition needs in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who received chemotherapy because of the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general status ( e.g. cardi@@ ovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia due to chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron defic@@ iency that are not available or in@@ adequate , with planned larger surgical procedures ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used prior to a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic surgery in adults with no iron defic@@ iency , where a high risk of transfer compensation is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml are applied , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial symptoms and follow @-@ up may vary depending on the age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease by the physician may be required .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ u@@ glob@@ ins by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations can be observed occasionally , or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be reached until 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ bin@@ es increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or exceeds the lasting hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ge 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be controlled eng@@ m@@ atically , in order to ensure that ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and angi@@ oplast@@ y symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly require higher yields than patients , where the initial an@@ emia is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly require higher levels of maintenance ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
initial symptoms and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on the age , gender and total disease load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease by the physician may be required .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be reached until 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be controlled eng@@ m@@ atically , in order to ensure that ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of int@@ ol@@ atory symptoms .
if the treatment of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the lab@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained at 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if , after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 i.@@ e / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin capacity increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained at 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number around &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , is an address to the ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with slight an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre@@ ventive storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned is required should be obtained twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgery procedure .
with the Iron subst@@ itution should be made as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ ors program - so that before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ am therapy , large iron reserves are available .

on this occasion , ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 i.@@ E. / kg should be given in each ten consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis about the hose of a needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic acid solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine in the cycle .
patients suffering from treatment with any Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin on an Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ plas@@ ia , PR@@ CA ) , should not be se@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk for deep ven@@ ge@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ ous known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) .
in patients who are ear@@ marked for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic surgery , the application of ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa drugs is contra@@ indicated : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , periph@@ eral disease of the disease or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently @-@ true heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ bodies @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin .
in patients with sudden active loss , defined as de@@ preci@@ ation of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ar values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be used for non @-@ oxid@@ ation , acid or vitamin B12 defic@@ iency , aluminium or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis .
if the tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is normal considering the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the col@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ zy@@ ten@@ ance ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ zy@@ ten@@ ance should be normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin anti@@ bodies should be analysed and an investigation of bone structure on the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity at sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed for patients with a risk of anti @-@ physically induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded the recommended limit of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentrations in section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality rate and risk for serious cardi@@ ovascular events were observed if Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of ep@@ oxy symptoms , when hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation concentration above the concentration of int@@ ran@@ al symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions concentration .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ism should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ant cor@@ on@@ ar@@ er heart failure or dust in@@ suff@@ iciency should not exceed the recommended limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentrations .
according to this knowledge , knowledge of an@@ emia is not accelerated due to the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency , not di@@ aly@@ sis , progression of ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency .
when cancer patients suffering from chemotherapy should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin @-@ answer ( patients who need to be trans@@ founded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ie@@ ved an@@ a@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim of keeping hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ism between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction under the involvement of the respective patients , which should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic surgery , if possible , exam@@ ines the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before the beginning of the ep@@ och@@ al @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients suffering from a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic surgery should have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ osis , as they have increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous diseases , especially in a underlying cardi@@ ovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with Epo@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with an increased risk of &gt; 13 g / dl a increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cul@@ ars may exist .
in several controlled trials , Epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that they can improve overall survival in the tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ our .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause than in men .
it is applied in patients with a high fac@@ tor@@ ch ( bone break ) , including patients who recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip break like the h@@ ass@@ alle ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should be obtained prior to the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta , which occur in the three days after the in@@ fusion of occurring symptoms , such as fever , muscle p@@ ains , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by doctors , which have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to an average rating of A@@ cl@@ asta .
during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spine and hip fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; it was investigated the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with cra@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es ) in the blood is norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of fra@@ c@@ tures were reduced in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis edi@@ cs ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis , the risk of fra@@ c@@ tures were reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be applied in patients that may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other mus@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other components .
like with all mus@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ ec@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physi@@ cians to prescri@@ be the A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients , in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Novartis Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to provide a permit for transport from A@@ cl@@ asta in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in male patients with increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recently paid low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once per year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , the adoption of in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical removal of the hip fra@@ cture ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors , which have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long R@@ emis@@ sion period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to get to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently paid low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ In@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms resulting in the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cancer @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended , as a limited clinical experience for this patient group are pre@@ valent .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) a dose of dos@@ ing is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in elderly patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data are missing on in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is pre @-@ treated before the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid integration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone structure , a temporary , partly symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta . ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to get to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ liz@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a tooth extraction with appropriate pre@@ ven@@ tive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental handles , no data is available whether the termination of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw sector .
the clinical assessment by the doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms resulting in the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ asta . ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of fibr@@ ill@@ ation in cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation had been increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was comparable to placebo ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted pharmac@@ ological effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney dysfunction , which is in combination with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases , as acute of kidney failure .
the change of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure , as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were compared to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after gift received 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory results the temporary as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study , treated patients treated to 21 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta in the early @-@ bus pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supple@@ mentary amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoiding clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoiding clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a recently qu@@ en@@ ched hip fra@@ cture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported by local reactions to in@@ fusion , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ oder@@ mic area , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ent@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which have been treated with mus@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports related to cancer patients or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area with A@@ cl@@ asta and with a placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia may be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium @-@ glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once per year was found in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density defect or a BM@@ D @-@ t @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing body fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric blood fra@@ c@@ tures are significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral bodies ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients from 75 years old and older had a reduced risk of fra@@ c@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures ( A@@ cl@@ asta reported a permanent effect on three years that resulted in a reduced risk of strokes in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on the lum@@ inal @-@ wir@@ y acid , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip is 6,0 % , the lower than by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In case of 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients that were treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the basin was taken .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the cer@@ eb@@ ular bone volume with the A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients and the receiving of the cer@@ eb@@ ular bone @-@ architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the output value and was held at 28 % below the output value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was reduced significantly by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on the general gre@@ ens and scra@@ pers at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment with an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the total price and more than 4.3 % of the scra@@ per .
clinical efficacy in men in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON RF@@ T study were random@@ ised to 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical trials was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta in relation to the once weekly gift from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was related to the percentage change of the Len@@ den@@ wir@@ l BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus pa@@ get des Kno@@ pp@@ asta was studied in patients and patients at age over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light @-@ based cardi@@ ac phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific upper normal value when inclusion in the study .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month studies .
with the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain k@@ ill@@ age was observed compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified by the end of the six @-@ month primary study as respon@@ ding to therapy , could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach to the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be maintained in the middle duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ off and multi@@ ples of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently .
after that , the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value .
rapid bi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ throw times t ½ to 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long @-@ elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ al elim@@ ination status t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ times ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone fabric .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts regardless of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains imp@@ acted by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration after time ) .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is used in addition to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( body Mass Index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or which are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond .
there were also four studies carried out in over 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used in comparison to a placebo as a supp@@ or@@ tive agent for adjusting the smoking .
the studies on the attitude of the smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was hard to assess on this application area .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Consult@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which it is explained as the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( particularly overweight patients ) can be applied . • It can be applied together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medication ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
additionally , it can be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) which cannot be satisfactory in the highest propor@@ tion@@ able dose .
in combination with a Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or insulin , the old dose of the sul@@ fa drugs may be maintained , except for patients with hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fa drugs or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be enhanced and the blood sugar level decre@@ ases , reducing type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ one in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ co@@ li@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which in@@ sist@@ ed that blood sugar levels have been lowered from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of acet@@ one and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo led to a lower@@ ing of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study included in the combination of acet@@ tos and insulin from 289 patients , patients who increased acet@@ one in addition to insulin , a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving in addition to placebo .
the most common adverse events related to acet@@ tos were disorders of the upper respir@@ atory disorders ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may respond to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ one ( high concentration level - acid level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients when met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 , the European Commission announced the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited , a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ compatible with which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
to use Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for patients under 18 years of age no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ovascular reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ma when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in combination with insulin is applied .
a cardi@@ ovascular in@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of age type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing macro@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been performed .
in this study , an increase in reports about heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit ) or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to the 3 times the maximum limit of the normal range are increased , the Li@@ ver Enzy@@ mes are as soon as possible .
if a patient symptoms developed which point to hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , up@@ scale pain , ti@@ red@@ ness , appet@@ ite and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver n@@ ym@@ ers to check .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient was continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , should be managed by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ um @-@ dependent weight gain was proven , which may stir from grease deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid tention .
as a result of a Hä@@ ep@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a minor reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ar ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in similar controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ u@@ al@@ um by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower extent also in patients under Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and insulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin @-@ sensitive skin consists of patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as an oral dual or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ia .
according to the market launch , Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ces , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ de@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there are direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ de@@ ma , but temp@@ ting doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular hole . a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of random@@ ized reports of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated fra@@ cture @-@ incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ patient with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , a study of 3.5 years of study of cardi@@ ovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this happens , treatment is reset ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or are not expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in lower@@ ing the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attri@@ but@@ able that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ activity levels and increased insulin resistant in pregnancy and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ atal@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( do not in@@ valuable ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ attach@@ ments also frequently appeared as compared to placebo , but less commonly compared to placebo but less than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ ular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure was less than under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than in placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on respectively .
since the market launch a lot of heart failure was reported under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , more often , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the history of the history .
it became a summar@@ izing analysis of random@@ ised inci@@ dents in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated in the groups treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation patients .
in the over a period of 3.5 years running PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appears to work on an activation of specific recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ an@@ omas Pro@@ lifer@@ ation / rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitive insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral vig@@ our in the case of insulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time up to the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was random@@ ised to random@@ ised in spite of the three @-@ phase optimi@@ zing phase with insulin , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the median of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c fell by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who still only received insulin ; a reduction of the insulin production in the patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a statist@@ ically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ ten compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ therapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week test of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction in the plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel and a slight rise , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL @-@ Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo was no statist@@ ically significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d have been observed .
in a study of 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , this can be applied to the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , a cardi@@ ovascular research study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing macro@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised to receive existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardi@@ ovascular treatment in either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the top concentration of the un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma normally 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV equals the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on could not be found relevant to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with R@@ if@@ ic@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the decay ( 55 % ) and a lower degree in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the median plasma @-@ elim@@ ination time of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active metabolism is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of dam@@ s were similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and ap@@ es coinci@@ ded with repeated plas@@ ma@@ volume enlargement with hem@@ ost@@ ar , an@@ a@@ emia , and re@@ versi@@ bly ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is attri@@ but@@ able that under the treatment of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is dimin@@ ished in the gest@@ ation of hyper@@ op@@ ul@@ ine and increased insulin resistant , which reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ atal@@ al growth .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use the insulin effective .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ col hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror representing the blood sugar level as strongly as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients that may possibly react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may have to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be entered in full list ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane weigh on the treatment of diabetes to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to provide a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily , if a rapid initi@@ al effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
the injection pin must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar refin@@ ement has significantly improved , for example , can be perceived by hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ia warning symptoms and should be deb@@ ated accordingly .
any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , human insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA ) can result in a change in dosage .
in case of moving to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dos@@ ing adjustment is required , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ic reactions have occurred after a change of animal insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travel , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor , since such travels can cause insulin and meals that have to be taken and taken at other times .
the doctor should therefore consider possible inter@@ actions in therapy and should always be question@@ ed to others of them .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Consult@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which it is explained as the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug .
the drug effective component in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin ( R@@ DNA ) , is produced with the method of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 e @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © EMEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Author@@ ised for non business , only the the EMEA , How was Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id investigated ?
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id cannot be applied in patients that may be sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must also be customized when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to permit a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin for the long @-@ term insulin .
3 . when moving to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in patients a dos@@ ing adjustment is required , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travel , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor , since such travels can cause insulin and meals that have to be taken and taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints given by appointment - During the insulin therapy local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection point ) occur .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sugar fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid sper@@ son or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the physician .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ abe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 not @-@ di@@ abe@@ tic patients who induced increased surgical procedures ( blood sugar 4,4 @-@ 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduces mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ abe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and teenagers ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , however , put the acceptance close to that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or layers of notes ( &quot; stones &quot; d. ) . greater pri@@ mor@@ nings that lead to joint and bone damages .
if the ur@@ inary belt is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ites , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , G@@ icht@@ an@@ cies can still occur ; therefore , the patients are recommended at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic and other medicines to prevent G@@ icht@@ an@@ cies .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involved in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( p@@ seudo @-@ medication ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug on treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ o@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was taken in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary belt in the blood was under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily consisted of 120 mg doses at the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in contrast , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients were under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart failure in pre@@ history may also contain increased risk of certain side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lower@@ ing of ur@@ inary production in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ k@@ emia in diseases which have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ ings ( including one from the medical history known to date , or date ) .
if the serum levels of serum for 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) , a dose of dose can be considered on the AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function limit , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .

liver disease During clinical trials of Phase 3 , minor responses of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function prior to the start of the F@@ eb@@ rov@@ ost@@ al treatment and in the course of clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was performed no in@@ effective studies on f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O in@@ hibition may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ k@@ line ( a inhibit@@ ing of met@@ abolic l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
the simultaneous gift of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily is associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ op@@ press ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

in a study of subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C by Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which suggests a possible f@@ og@@ or@@ ical effect of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ ide , the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) , but no significant change of AU@@ C causes no significant change .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be included on the side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when taxes of a vehicle , using machines or during exercise of dangerous activities , until they can be reason@@ ably confident that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC did not affect their performance .

7 Open long @-@ term renewal studies in the open long@@ time extension studies were treated in 906 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years treated with f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related during the long term - renewal studies have been similar to those who have been reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treated events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and compet@@ ed in patients who received F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long@@ time extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to the data occasionally .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was performed in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were carried out with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hypertension and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study of the share of patients with the last three months given certain Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ac@@ id@@ spar &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum concentration in a study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with usual doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
in regard to the permanent lower@@ ing of the serum concentration below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) , the statist@@ ically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lower@@ ing of the serum concentration at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and are permanently maintained throughout the treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney function restri@@ cting the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. , h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) were achieved .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of per@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of 10 mg / dl over 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years collected data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients were carried out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. greater than 97 % of patients needed no treatment for a shift boost ) .
this was associated with a reduction in layers of layers , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the spec@@ tra of up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentration of plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma centr@@ ation period ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is an integer of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses ranging between 120 mg and 300 mg , for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at is observed a increase in AU@@ C is greater than the dos@@ e- proportional increase .
after the intake of simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max amounts approximately 2,8 @-@ 3,2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration . if it was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l , depending on doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
plasma bonds of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding on alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent with the concentration width that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ en showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed mainly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly f@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at found approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) again .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine , about 45 % of the dose took place in the chair as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ ath ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 7 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at does not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the median overall AU@@ C by F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 times of 7,5 μ tr@@ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13,@@ 2 μ g b@@ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ opause , in which there is a risk for a low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or use other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not place until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in the European Union , the company recorded data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also carried out a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D refle@@ ctions .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the share of patients with low vitamin D levels had been treated with patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those that are exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate . ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data to indicate that the al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ osis ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of digest@@ ive devices such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ un ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , ul@@ cers , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( swal@@ lowing ) , broken abdom@@ en ( rec@@ ess stomach ) as well as acid .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who can stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or use of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
following critics are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of mat@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swallowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the appearance of the day . • The patients should not cut the tablet into the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ept@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal blood or surgical procedures in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , P@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al van@@ tions , were rarely reported in patients under the consumption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore observe attention to any signs and symptoms that are pointed out to potential off@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as dy@@ spher@@ ag@@ ia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ ular pain or new or deteri@@ or@@ ating so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and take care of medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe Ag@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or according to the occurrence of symptoms that refer to a P@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions are passed to the patient and are understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was observed , rare ( according to market ) Mag@@ nets and Du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and complications , reports ( see section 4.8 ) .

clinical assessment by the doctor treating the doctor is decisive for therapy planning on each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take care of the dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet into the next morning after having noticed their legacy .
you should not take two tablets that same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the mineral change ( such as vitamin D defic@@ iency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm@@ us ) , should also be treated appropri@@ ately prior to the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale drugs may imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly damaged effects regarding pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf will suff@@ ice to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver in order to prevent a rep@@ ulsion of transplan@@ ted organs by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft used already in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study on 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation was presented , with the use of Ad@@ vag@@ us using Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients that transplan@@ ted after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , investig@@ ating how often a renewed transplan@@ t or res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , shorter study studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation performed and studied how Ad@@ vag@@ raf is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients suffering from hyper@@ sensitivity to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( allergy ) , macro @-@ antibiot@@ ics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ raf as the Ad@@ vag@@ ue dose or the dose of the same medication may be adjusted accordingly .

only physi@@ cians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t cancer should be assigned to this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to transplan@@ ting or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immune supp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ mus form@@ ulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of form@@ ulation or regim@@ es should only be carried out under the thorough control of a medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative wording , a therapeutic drug control and corresponding dos@@ ing adjust@@ ments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains .
the dose of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of separation and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations
after the conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ue , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ m should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposure was measured as a valley , both in both kidney stones and kidney transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspection of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ ue to ensure adequate substance @-@ exposure to immediate transplan@@ tation .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s state does not allow oral drugs in the first postoperative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of approx .
duration of the application for supp@@ ression of transplan@@ t must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose @-@ rep@@ ell@@ ings - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rep@@ ulsion The oral Ad@@ vag@@ ue therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ ing adjust@@ ments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be changed over the stabili@@ zation of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose @-@ rep@@ ell@@ ings - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t die The oral Ad@@ vag@@ ue therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ue must be converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf so this conversion has taken place at a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney clean@@ se and liver transplan@@ tation After a transition from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ ue once daily has to start treatment with the recommended oral dose for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rep@@ ulsion .
heart transplan@@ t for adult patients who be converted to Ad@@ vag@@ ue is an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day every day .
other transplan@@ ts were probably no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients received pro@@ gra@@ f patients in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day for application .
in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a substitute of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dose may not be required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including the regular determination of the serum levels ) is recommended .
conversion from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ue When switching from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to Tal@@ king in full blood The dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of separation and toler@@ ability in individual cases under condition of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mal Contro@@ ls .
it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood pressure levels from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ue , Dos@@ age custom@@ ization , changes of immun@@ o@@ cer@@ vical cancer , which could be controlled by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ue is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State occurred .
according to clinical trials , the data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ ro@@ li@@ m cells lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with gar@@ nish @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent treatment of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were used .
this led to serious adverse events including transplan@@ ting or other side effects , which may occur in sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ mus form@@ ulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of form@@ ulation or regim@@ es should be carried out only under the close control of a medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t rep@@ ulsion , proven to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ va as therapy @-@ resistant , there are no clinical data for ret@@ arded form@@ ulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
in the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t supp@@ ression in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft , no clinical data for ret@@ arded form@@ ulation is present before .
because of possible inter@@ actions , which may lead to a substitute of tac@@ tical levels in blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , is the intake of herbal compound , the cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant drugs during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the blood flow concentrations are offered in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subjected to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , Pro@@ gra@@ f was observed in rare cases called Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy that can be observed as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy that can thus occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ue .
other factors that increase the risk of such so@@ unding disorders is an existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ ero@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid flow and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ va , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun@@ shield with a high protection factor .
if patients that use Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for Pre@@ s such as head@@ aches , different level of consciousness , cr@@ amping and eye distur@@ ban@@ ces , should be a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf hard capsules , ret@@ arded , l@@ act@@ ose , is advis@@ able to treat patients with the rare associated Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase defic@@ iency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ malaria .
simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicinal products which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and consequently increase blood levels from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advis@@ able to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ genital blood levels in the simultaneous gift of substances that enable the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism to monitor and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintaining consistent concentrations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a highly pronounced interaction was made with anti@@ fung@@ ot@@ ics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies resulted in the increase of blood levels mainly resulting from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal per@@ spiration , results .
highly do@@ si@@ fied pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute removal reactions , can increase or lower concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , whose metabolism can affect metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can minimize the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , is particularly careful when making decisions regarding recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and whose half @-@ time can extend .
the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ t cancer provide no note that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immune supp@@ res@@ si@@ va , is an increased risk of unwanted events involving the course and the result of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , we recommend monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns to any harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding the kidneys ) .
it is the risk of an early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ com@@ k@@ emia of the new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) , i.e. :

cases of BK @-@ virus associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ otherapy therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
it has been reported using ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ op@@ las@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumor in connection with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high bonds of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma samples can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sible .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level might be convey@@ ed by the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ de dependent inhibit@@ or of signal transfer because of the T cells , thus preventing the tran@@ scription of a particular number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus expresses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of T cells ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ inter@@ fer@@ on ) as well as the expression of inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

L@@ ung@@ Over@@ transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis conducted via a recently conducted multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f has been reported on 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
also a chronic transplan@@ t rep@@ ulsion , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated , was observed in the first year after transplan@@ t to be observed less frequent ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .

the number of cases where Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients who were lo@@ osed from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ t rep@@ ulsion was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7,7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in case of un@@ conditional patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ lan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in one study the frequency of birth of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ ite obl@@ iter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower with the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .

the oral initi@@ als ( per protocol ) by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and after reaching the targeted heart rate of 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .

factors such as a low hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or being responsible through treatment with cor@@ ti@@ de@@ ero@@ ids , or being responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , with the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the bile .
for stable patients who were taken from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) at Ad@@ vag@@ ue ( once a day ) in relation to the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than pro@@ gra@@ f .

adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII un@@ related , inn@@ ate bleeding ) .
dosage and incidence of application will be addressed , whether adv@@ ances to treat bleeding or prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII defic@@ iency that causes blood cl@@ adding to joints , muscles , or internal organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell produced in which a gene ( DNA ) has been incorporated into the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it &apos;s produced differently , so that drug may contain no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with serious to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding or surgical procedures .
in the main study the effectiveness of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood levels was received with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
lawyers may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against human scent factor VIII , Maus@@ - or ham@@ sters , or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to grant approval for author@@ isation of lawyers in the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of subst@@ itution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII defic@@ iency , after the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of the patient .
with the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII @-@ activity should not fall under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is over for the patient .
during treatment , it is used to control the administered dose and the frequency of injec@@ tions an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ mir@@ gel .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different hal@@ ves .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ can do not be reached or if the bleeding is not ruled out with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to assign an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the conversion speed should be set up after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ac@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , who qu@@ anti@@ fy in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
developing the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the magn@@ itude of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the biggest and other factors within the first 20 Ex@@ position days .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ ne@@ ically @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , after the conversion of a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII , it was observed for another , re@@ play of ( lowest tit@@ res ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare set@@ backs of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
in the largest number of patients receiving A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who have previously untreated patients who have been higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data not in@@ valuable ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculated post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 @-@ 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ots was sustained throughout the period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 post@@ oper@@ able day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with a companion heavier H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an old age of 6 years and a companion severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was diagnosed after prior exposure against factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentration rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE were treated against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated protein was analyzed by the investigation of anti@@ bodies against such proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statist@@ ically significant upward trend and a prolonged peak of anti@@ bodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell protein , otherwise , no signs or symptoms occ@@ ured on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , on the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported via hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergy type , including an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic / an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic acid reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII acts as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VIII @-@ Activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over trial with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in the below table 3 .

based on the data available since the first approval , CH@@ MP continues to be considered positive , but considered that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the safety filter of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is necessary to submit a further renewal process to the filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months .
December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited distributed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) , with that the company takes its application for author@@ ization to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
however , the breast , the brain , bones , or pasture parts ( tissues , which combines other structures in the body , are affected and relies on ) .
this is a type of virus , gene@@ tically modified so it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which was so changed that it does not produce any copies of itself , and therefore no infections can trigger infections in humans .
Ad@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to form a normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defect in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene is usually induced to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA can not be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share .
the company submitted data from a study involving a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ li@@ fication , bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP has examined the answers of the company on which questions asked him , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the initial documentation , the CH@@ MP created a list of questions that will be sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors will bring benefits to patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of drug in the body , the kind of administration as well as the safety of drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company won &apos;t know the CH@@ MP in consideration of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered drugs release &quot; means that the tablets are thus composed so that one of the effective components is instantly released and the other slowly released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len prot@@ ru@@ ed inflammation of the nose ) in patients with nose @-@ mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , above all the swelling of the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ gged nose ) , are cl@@ oned .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main effects were the sever@@ ity of gravity of the hypo@@ cr@@ ushing symptoms occurring by the patient prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated them with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all Heu@@ v@@ ella symptoms except the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who received Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , compared to a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who are si@@ p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reli@@ eving of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who lost Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side @-@ effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , in@@ som@@ nia , and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ous drugs or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glau@@ coma ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) , hypertension , or already a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( blood circulation caused stroke ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to permit a permit for the in@@ flows of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , to swal@@ low ( i.e. without bit@@ ing or cut off ) .
due to the lack of data to infin@@ ity and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , it should not be applied for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of application is as short as possible and should not be continued after crash@@ es of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , since at long time use the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine at time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory tract , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can continue as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( Mao ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .

safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective , and the data are not enough to express appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and data are not enough to express appropriate recommendations on dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ats or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of the head@@ aches ) must be removed .

Aer@@ in@@ aze is to conclude at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines may otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their magn@@ itude .
as part of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .

the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable application of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities as compared to the frequency of normal population .
since Re@@ production studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and based on vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in the pregnancy .
patients should , however , be clari@@ fied , that in very rare cases , it can lead to a benefit of dec@@ ency or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardi@@ ovascular colonies ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

these include both the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / bass hel@@ ds as well as in@@ hibition of expression of the Ad@@ jun@@ sion@@ ol@@ ec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective hits or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to placebo .
oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
it took 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determines from the total co@@ res for the symptoms ( except nose @-@ loops ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , measured using the nose @-@ mu@@ c@@ skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 weeks treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable in the plasma within 30 minutes after the administration .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze on healthy subjects over 14 days , the assembly @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine has been reached on Day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dos@@ dos@@ se study , which was carried out with the form@@ ulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects suffered from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine badly .
one component intervention study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , for recovery and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , however , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can not recognize any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no bigger tox@@ icity as its individual components , and the observed effects were generally found in connection with the ingredient p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in reprodu@@ ci@@ ously clinical trials the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic .

it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg of tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children ages one to five years the dose is 1.@@ 25 m@@ g. a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and sy@@ rup .
for children from six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup and sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was involved in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with an allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by changing the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ r@@ elling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is un@@ think@@ able .
in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all trials were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us were observed for the average decrease of the symp@@ tom ( men@@ tion@@ points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria decrease the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients that may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to permit approval from A@@ eri@@ us to the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergy ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials to the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to previous clinical symptoms and can be resumed after the end of the symptoms .
the persistent allergy symptoms ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the everyday period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , treating am@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not ampli@@ fied the efficient effects of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it can be used to benefit from per@@ fi@@ able traffic or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergy rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when treated with placebo .
the most commonly used side effects , which was reported more frequently than in placebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , oral dr@@ one ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect head@@ aches that occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dosage ) .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stic cells / bass hel@@ ds as well as in@@ hibition of expression of the Ad@@ jun@@ sion@@ ol@@ ec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al@@ cells .
as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ technical problems , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has been administered up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dosage ) was administered over ten days , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ ing study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subjective hits or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in treating the symptoms like Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ages and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be classified as an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ing allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week , more than 4 weeks .
as shown using the total co@@ res of the quest@@ ionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ lig@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the e@@ ti@@ ology , similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited much easier .
since the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is also reported in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ ju@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ r@@ ye at the end of the first dose @-@ intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching over 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seas@@ on@@ ally allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ population was achieved at 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , this enzyme has not yet been identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded entirely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ ited in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ isation study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dosage of 7,5 mg , meals ( fatty food , low @-@ oriented breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical trials carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in carried out clinical trials in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences in the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , for reli@@ eving symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ption doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data can be found which support a treatment of inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous rhin@@ itis with an@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to exclusion of respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical exam@@ inations and corresponding laboratory and related laboratory studies should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and learn a higher amount of subst@@ itution ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 who met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to the children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absor@@ p@@ ation or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ iciency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , treating A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not ampli@@ fied the efficient effects of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total th@@ reading of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as compared to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and yo@@ ungst@@ ers in different indications , including allergy rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in an adult dose of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dosage ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who were born for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ jun@@ k of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in could be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple people in adults and adolescents , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has been used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and yo@@ ungst@@ ers , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dosage ) was applied more than ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents is no incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to placebo .
for a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets of adults and adolescents in clinical studies have no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , it caused by simultaneous consumption of alcohol neither to a ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced power imp@@ air even to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively in reli@@ eving symptoms like Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ages and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown using the total co@@ res of the quest@@ ionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ lig@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduces the caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ ju@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ r@@ ye at the end of the first dose @-@ intervals .
this reduced met@@ abo@@ li@@ ous phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with an allergic rhin@@ itis , observed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a set @-@ up time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no evidence of any clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were found in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with the recommended doses comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , this enzyme has not yet been identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , so that interaction with other medicines may not be completely excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ ung@@ las@@ es with children &apos;s secure polypropylene @-@ end cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
an influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic appears when a new strain of the influ@@ enza virus emerges , which can easily spread by humans , because people have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the parts contained in the vaccine from the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; physically alien &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it .
thereby , the immune system is able to form faster anti@@ bodies in a contact with an influ@@ enza virus .
then the membrane h@@ ul@@ ls of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es ) was separated , cleaned and cleaned as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites revealed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; Good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this gives the extent of clinical data base to evaluate the safety of the vaccine , in order to fulfill the requirements of the EMEA region &apos;s guidelines for pre@@ ventive vacc@@ ines .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with Human Immun@@ e virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are being infected by the acquired immun@@ ode@@ fic@@ iency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ fra@@ ase is available as a solution for import , but this cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which the patient has previously taken an@@ tivir@@ al drugs to the patient , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has evaluated the virus to address the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al pharmac@@ euticals twice daily .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al pharmac@@ euticals , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at low level .
AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system , and thus also the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this was compared with low d@@ osed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase by 206 adults who used previously prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children that previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , were very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the virus was effectively treated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drugs A@@ generation after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in the patient receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , fl@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( blood circulation ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ big@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied to patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are equally harmful to blood and harmful in high concentrations in blood .
as with other pharmac@@ euticals to HIV , patients suffering from ac@@ er@@ ase ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ ec@@ a ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral pharmac@@ euticals to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee set out that the benefit of ac@@ ar in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; outstanding circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to bring approval to funds from A@@ gener@@ ase throughout the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is combined in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
to usually , A@@ generated capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance and pre@@ treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ generated capsules and solution for intake are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ generated capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied additi@@ ve of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ths ) , doses of A@@ generated ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily .
the recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of aspir@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease agents were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for infin@@ ity and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with mild or excessive liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of risk reduction in the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to healing the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ generated is not preventing the risk of a transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ generated capsules should be applied together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C suffer anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous tivir@@ al treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the subject of the medicine concerned .
patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic hep@@ atitis hep@@ atitis show a higher frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ ids , which is not recommended by CY@@ P3@@ A4 effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and re@@ pression of the tri@@ but@@ ary function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the changing of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors of Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on the increased risk of my@@ op@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ath including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis not recommended .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm R@@ atio ) , are available methods for determining the concentration of active concentration .
in patients that use these medicines at the same time , A@@ fra@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plas@@ mas@@ on@@ ins ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ det@@ ra@@ ids , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity in due to the high prop@@ yl @-@ gly@@ col solution of the a@@ em@@ ase solution for inc@@ eption , this form@@ ulation of children under a age of four years is contra@@ indicated and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
ar@@ ase should be set to duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , has been reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , or an ex@@ az@@ her@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had different diseases in their therapy , which were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B . higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with the associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous c@@ ut@@ ters ha@@ em@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ idal combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory response to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial ae@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ ques , alcohol consumption , heavy immune supp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ ec@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ fra@@ ase may not be given at the same time with drugs , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width A@@ pl@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs , whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rology and lead to resistance development .
in an attempt to compens@@ ate the degra@@ ding plasma level by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were observed very frequently undes@@ irable effects on the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ ap@@ avi@@ r can be de@@ hydr@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
when a patient already records cur@@ rants , the am@@ big@@ av@@ ir@@ mal levels are , and if possible to check the viral load and reset the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose of dos@@ ing for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r ( see also ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase for C@@ max , by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day which prove the efficacy and am@@ big@@ u@@ ity of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % dri@@ zzle if Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 750 m@@ g. twice daily ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ al@@ b@@ abo@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ ca@@ vi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) is administered twice daily .
a dos@@ ing dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to have a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the application of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended because of the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ ed component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ fra@@ ase are at least one hour apart . ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ ef@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would serious .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ ps might be reduced to the serum concentration of am@@ at@@ avi@@ r .
if the medicine should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtle plasma diseases .
if these treatments are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring should be carried out , as an accurate forecast for the effect of the combination of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in plasma centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thus an increase in the side effects associated with R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of the simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ vi@@ r and 100 mg of R@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole daily lead to 2.@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value that was observed after 200 m@@ g. of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ vi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r every day .
other medicines that can be listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , if they can be applied together with A@@ generated , possibly inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are linked to these drugs , when combined in combination with A@@ fra@@ ase .
based on the data of other Prot@@ eas@@ ants , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as a@@ em@@ ase because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va that are known as an enzyme equivalent ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower level of amber .
serum concentration of calcium block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ odi@@ pine , di@@ odi@@ pine , di@@ odi@@ pine , di@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous taking with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and increase the side effects including P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ ings , vision@@ aries and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules have been given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ ate ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ v@@ all 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ a with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ ids , unless the possible use of a treatment exceeds the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ qu@@ ero@@ id effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose contam@@ in@@ ating is strongly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 , are expected to increase influ@@ x of the plasma levels at the same time .
since plasma increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines will not be recommended using Am@@ ap@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended to increase the therapeutic concentration of therapeutic concentrations until stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous gift of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , ai@@ ase may not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using the same application of a@@ em@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am be@@ ware is advis@@ able .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am , 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the less@@ er reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , how the am@@ big@@ avi@@ r dose is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
while simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predict@@ able , therefore alternative methods are recommended to the recep@@ tion@@ ality .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the same gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used by careful considering the possible use for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ ing rats , am@@ big@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ ap@@ avi@@ r passes humans into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight .
further development of the reproduction , including the fertility and Re@@ production capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ ap@@ avi@@ r on the mother@@ tier .
the imm@@ ort@@ ality of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment were slightly marked up , they occur early and frequently lead to treatment .
with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment applied to the HIV treatment or if they are a consequence of the atro@@ city .
most of the adverse events are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not treated 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) indicated by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study drug standing and in more than 1 % of the patients were listed as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy is associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( hyst@@ eria ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and periph@@ eral fatty tissue , increased intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation ( bul@@ lets ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral no pre @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ at@@ ud@@ ine in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over an average duration of 36 weeks , was observed only a case ( bull ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients under am@@ at@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in comparison to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in case of 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is on a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash were usually slightly pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ y or mak@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching , usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without leaving the treatment with am@@ big@@ ca@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ o@@ ec@@ rose in particular were reported in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ idal combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory response to as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who were observed twice daily together with low dose R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were given in patients suffering from A@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very common .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of oxid@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures .
Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r binds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 protein and prevents the process of proc@@ essi@@ onal and G@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ gs with the result of an education , non @-@ inf@@ ec@@ ti@@ ous viral particles .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ at@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood vessels .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the correlation between HIV @-@ 1 and HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ a@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r Treatment schem@@ es - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
in sixteen patients from 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral , previously untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study E@@ SS@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates of isol@@ ates .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not show up resist@@ ence , which were similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and the extension of AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg ) of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors about 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors on :
gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance measurement based analyses Gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations can be applied to the estim@@ ation of the activity of am@@ at@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease @-@ resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V / F / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V .
conclusions concerning the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always move the current inter@@ pret@@ ations to analyze the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , clinical analy@@ tically vali@@ dated analysis systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ation of the activity of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease @-@ resist@@ ent isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( part@@ itions ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ at@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain Crus@@ ader against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r , however , remains generally preserved .
there is currently data to cross @-@ resist@@ ence between am@@ big@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ er avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral no pre @-@ treated patients with which a Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ca@@ vi@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ca@@ vi@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ca@@ quin@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Tip@@ b@@ abo@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Tip@@ ran@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and type ca@@ vi@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the ins@@ ates .
the early termination of an vers@@ al therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a multitude of mut@@ ations in limits which may affect the subsequent treatment .
the receipt of effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 twice daily ) with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100@@ mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ al@@ oga ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily covered with the low@@ ly R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , &quot; received .
one hundred and six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generation , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis provided the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in relation to the period adjusted average of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ slip shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI had been treated .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of PI treated with PI had previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is earlier .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell number from 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on this data should be considered during treatment optimization with PI in treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; ec@@ stasy .
according to oral administration , the medium length ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase for C@@ max , by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered together with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dos@@ ing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be tied to a large share volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ ab@@ b@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the active concentration in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ big@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ ab@@ b@@ abo@@ o constantly remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient during the met@@ ering inter@@ v@@ alls in the Ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce CY@@ P3@@ A4 should be in@@ hib@@ ited or in@@ hib@@ ited or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , with caution given to be given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ s@@ ules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ y@@ ph@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ generated capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction might be low on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatments are comparable to am@@ at@@ avi@@ r plasma welding , which are achieved twice daily , after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r twice daily , without the simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .

the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ ato@@ cell ular aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ omas were not clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data on people , both clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , have little evidence for adop@@ ting a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro diagnostics tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel analysis in rats and chromos@@ om@@ ination test on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes were included , was Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals that were treated from a age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the am@@ at@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
in a system@@ ic plasma presentation , which was significantly lower ( rabbits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage compared to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ eton changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ generated capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied additi@@ ve of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ths ) , doses of A@@ generated ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily .
the recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use of patients with weak or mild liver function should be done with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .

a dos@@ ing dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to have a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ ef@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would serious .
if these treatments are used together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring should be carried out , as an accurate forecast for the effect of the combination of am@@ big@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to reduce the dosage of R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data available .

local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually take during the treatment of intensity or go back after placing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if local skin reactions do great dis@@ comfort in patients or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - les@@ ions have a lower total rate of healing referred to as patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution , patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

the most frequently played and probably possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream into the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of the F@@ eig@@ n ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the most commonly reported and possibly reported or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the context of adverse events include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 2@@ 8,1 % .
the Bas@@ ali@@ om @-@ Pati@@ ents treated from 185 using i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the related side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application place ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the side effects caused by 252 to placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies in phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
according to the examination plan , the clinical signs indicate that in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently showed to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ them ( 30 % ) , ec@@ ori@@ ation / fl@@ yers ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the testing plan , the assessment of clinical signs showed that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , showed very often to severe er@@ y@@ oning ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ ids ( 13 % ) , and serious scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials to examine the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis Alo@@ pe@@ zie was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental single oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , may lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s increasing levels of alpha inter@@ fer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 , relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in regards to a complete compensation of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ os in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment can be superior to 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
at 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients were fully charged ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :

Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with mol@@ lus@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies with the dos@@ ages there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream due to the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug con@@ concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ alled 0.1 , 0.2 , and 1,6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated interim period lay approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged re@@ tention of drug in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after the top@@ onic application of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ structural basis cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four month study on the paint tox@@ icity at the rat used doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; one also performed four months for the paint application showed no similar effects during the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice was induced by three days a week , no tum@@ ors placed at the use of the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption of human skin , and does not fail , is a risk for people due to system@@ ic exposure as very low .
tum@@ ors were present in the group of mice that was treated with the real @-@ free cream , previously and in larger numbers than in the control group with minimal U@@ VR .

in the study , the safety of the drug was mainly investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured by reducing its effect in relation to the reduction in G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me increased the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions on the in@@ fusion location .
very common adverse events in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who react strongly to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be able to check all new information ( EMEA ) every year , to test and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding reactions to in@@ fusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for transport from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal Cell Cul@@ tures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of Mu@@ til@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase defic@@ iency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the initial In@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is wearing this , all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not established , and no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the fusion Day ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ ational equipment for medical emergen@@ cies .
due to clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to form usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretical increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment carefully .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ ards ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of an easy or indirect positive reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reducing the rate of in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is weak@@ ened .
in@@ fusion can be resumed on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the fusion rate , when the response has occurred , with which the response has occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , as well as a reduction in the fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , which occurred in the previous reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of an inter@@ ference with the intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data to new@@ bor@@ ns which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on breast milk , is recommended to satisfy during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were mainly filed as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in the study of 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years of age ( duration of up to 1 year ) .
unwanted pharmac@@ ist reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which have been observed during the phase 3 study and their extension for a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently observed in the following table : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some cases with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional participation of upper respir@@ atory symptoms and lungs in the Pre@@ history , there were also severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation status and visual alle@@ g@@ ation ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly heavy leg@@ ume form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients there was a ser@@ o@@ on@@ version within 3 months after the treatment was performed during the age of 5 with a heavy evap@@ or@@ atory version ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature termination of the study ) were found in 13 / 45 patients by Radio@@ immun@@ oph@@ cip@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able anti@@ bodies , including 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ o@@ onist .
patients with missing until low @-@ anti@@ bodies have been a robust reduction in G@@ ag mirror in the urine , while patients with high antibody tit@@ ers was a variable reduction in G@@ ag in the urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed mar@@ g@@ inal to minor neutr@@ alis@@ ory effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro , which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction in G@@ ag in urine .
the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable medicines , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibody .
the reas@@ oning for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and preventing any other accumulation sufficient .
after an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most prob@@ able above man @-@ 6 phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ised in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients showed the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient had the severe phen@@ otype .
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients with the placebo group to improve lung function and in@@ ability to be displayed in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerged from the following table .
the decline in percentage ratio of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ os@@ ina increased further to the size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a hep@@ atitis , 22 % ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant waste of G@@ ag mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , that remained constant until the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end score , which was clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a single @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigated in 20 patients at the time of their admission to the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the severe circulation form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - levels in the urine in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) demonstrated a normal mental development ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development rate , while in the elderly patients were limited to limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations about the pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ ag mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , an represented alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients that previously had not been treated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients that previously applied to other chemotherapy regim@@ en as well as several therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and obtain injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be present before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition to an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent a fluid defic@@ iency ) .
in patients whose blood count changes , or in which certain other side effects appear , the treatment should be suspended , set off or the dose decre@@ ases .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier to fit than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer duration of cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were treated to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta has also been compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients in which cancer were not attacked by cancer cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than survival compared to the drug treatment .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for transport from A@@ lim@@ ta to the European Union .
each det@@ ach@@ ment bottle needs to be redeemed with 4,2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the di@@ stra@@ y bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further th@@ inner ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al , advanced or metastatic non @-@ cell@@ ed bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
for the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions one day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ f@@ ero@@ id will be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid , taking the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third operation cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before every gift , including differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and one th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cyc@@ line count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course there must be a dos@@ ing test taking place under the rec@@ tification of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the forec@@ asting therapy cycles .
according to the recovery , patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria con@@ form to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) and CT@@ C degrees 2 blood@@ stream .
should patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grad 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the patient must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients are reduced to 2 dose @-@ reducing tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 or so@@ - on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above , in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , an increased se@@ ven@@ i@@ - ko consists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to not sufficient data for harm@@ less@@ ness and efficacy .
in clinical trials in patients with a cancer @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dose adjustment is necessary , which are recommended for all patients recommended Dos@@ age adjust@@ ments .
data for patients with a cancer @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values from the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( with presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically examined in the studies .
patients need to be observed with regard to the bone mar@@ row and pun@@ ches must not be given to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ il has reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tot@@ als have reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ili@@ ation , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and maximum non @-@ ha@@ ired tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 of hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was be@@ aut@@ op@@ ed if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients need to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a pre@@ ventive tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium in@@ suff@@ iciency in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ist@@ ika ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and mind@@ - after 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is necessary to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who compet@@ ed these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ du@@ p should be considered in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 severe cardi@@ ovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ed lifel@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial of re@@ productive ability consists of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out prior to treatment - G@@ inn to get advice regarding the lock serv@@ icing .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses can lead non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ist@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced breakdown of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able if patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ - , 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data for interaction with N@@ SA@@ IDs in long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed by pregnant women , but like an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected to treat serious birth defects in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful visibility of the use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of re@@ productive ability consists of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the course of treatment , advice regarding the lock braking .
it is not known if P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in breast milk and undes@@ irable effects may not be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received study medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statist@@ ically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ a- T@@ in arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of lung functioning parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the time of the control .

limited data of a separately random@@ ised , monitored phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 540 ) and without ( n = 540 ) .
the efficacy analysis of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination to the gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fet@@ al @-@ based nutrition .
patients who occupy all@@ i and can not use weight loss after 12 weeks , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they cannot drain some fats in the food , making a quarter of the fats associated with food un@@ noticed the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies on patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients with all@@ i 60 mg of income came to an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side @-@ effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at anus , fle@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bo@@ wel movements , ling@@ erie / o@@ ily sto@@ ols ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .

all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , fet@@ al @-@ based nutrition .
all@@ i may not be applied by children and yo@@ ungst@@ ers under 18 because there are not sufficient data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ously absorbed , is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .

the probability of adv@@ ancing gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) may take if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or o@@ ily diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be used with improved met@@ abolic inspection , patients who consult a medicine with all@@ i , before the start of a therapy with all@@ i , consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist if necessary .
patients who occupy all@@ i as well as medicines for hypertension , or an increased Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel , should consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to prevent additional fluctu@@ ating measures to prevent the oral contra@@ diction in the case of severe di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on pharmac@@ euticals to drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed a reduction of Cic@@ los@@ in @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ mir@@ gel .
in combination with or@@ list@@ at or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally stand@@ ar@@ dised ratio ratio ) can be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time to take a supplement of the Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin awarded to ensure a sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a unique dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , was observed a minor decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal studies reveal no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are combined with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg above a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is in@@ valuable ) .
the incidence of the adverse events known after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were volunte@@ ered by a population of un@@ certain size .
+ It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to anxiety associated with possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , without any significant clinical findings .
during the majority of the cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on exam@@ inations on humans and animals can be attributed from a fast return of any system@@ ic effects , which are attributed to li@@ vest@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by co@@ valent Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ kre@@ atic li@@ ve@@ en .
clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at is taken three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food oil is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 at@@ tains the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , fet@@ al @-@ based nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been rated as follows : as alter@@ ation of the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

plasma centr@@ ation of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 For therapeutic dos@@ ages , non @-@ met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was measured only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who was administered in a minimal system@@ ic dose , two main met@@ abolic rate , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ form @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified by approximately 42 % of the total plas@@ mas@@ on@@ centr@@ ation .

al@@ xi is used in chemotherapy regim@@ ens that are strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( like c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chemotherapy agents ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended to provide the effects in this age group not enough information .
this means that the substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
al@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of patients who treated with Alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chemotherapy and vom@@ iting agents , 81 % of patients who treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vom@@ iting ( 153 out of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi within the European Union .
al@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer illness and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be ampli@@ fied by adding one of the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron extend the col@@ on days , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty or@@ ip@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored according to injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is advis@@ able from the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the QT to interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is pro@@ lon@@ gs , or which may extend to such an extension .
in addition to other chemotherapy @-@ therapeu@@ tics , al@@ xi should not be used for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .

in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , o@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , am@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ra@@ x@@ or@@ um , nap@@ iti@@ dine , ra@@ x@@ or@@ um , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be applied , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least possibly with al@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and fruit ip@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the reception ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing expertise .
in the group with the highest dosage exhibits similar skins of unwanted events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effectiveness to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double blind@@ ed studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate in@@ ant chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ day 7.3 hours ) , which was given on Day 1 without the dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study included 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the study with moderate @-@ based chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ ant chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials of indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the ability to block the ion@@ ary and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular channels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ al half of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally observed in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in patients and cancer patients .
after an intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured in 11 Ho@@ den@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , that with once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days reached overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was measured after an exceptional intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher than 0.@@ 75 mg upwards .
about 40 % elimin@@ ates about the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites that have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron via less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for met@@ abolic studies have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , the CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changing active ingredient made around 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver function may increase the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination time and the average system@@ ic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate to the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 of these clinical trials have shown evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion@@ age channels , which can extend to vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action time .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of people ) which resulted in an increased frequency of liver cancer , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ ni@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tumor in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the used high doses and since al@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time use , the relev@@ ance of these results will be low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products Regulation ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the pharmac@@ euticals permit for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C intended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C was recommended in the treatment of hep@@ atitis C 6 million IE / ml injec@@ tion@@ ing solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should re@@ semble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Instru@@ ctor . &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ long ) hep@@ atitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
with a micro@@ scop@@ ic study , liver tissue exp@@ ires damage , in addition , the values of the Li@@ pt@@ ine Al@@ an@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon put data on the basis of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , action , safety and efficacy of hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study on patients with Hepatitis C the efficacy of Alph@@ eon has been compared with the efficacy of the reference to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , how many patients were given after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after adjustment of treatment to the drug ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns relating to the stability of the active substance and the drug may not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with Hepatitis C based on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
after adjustment of the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was ret@@ ard@@ ant with more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Alph@@ eon also had any side effects .
apart from that , the test used in the study was investig@@ ating the question of how the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( a skin infection ) and small infected firm@@ ary ( R@@ iss@@ - or mou@@ th@@ ec@@ onds ) , de@@ preci@@ ation and se@@ wed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for treating infections that have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resist@@ ent Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infections .
al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months but in patients under 18 years of age , the treated skin surface may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment two or three days , the doctor should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatment .
it works by blocking of bacterial rib@@ bons ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and therefore in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the primary Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was ab@@ orted to the end of the treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients were enrolled in the treatment .
in the treatment of infected bon@@ fires , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at skin @-@ dogs , about 90 % of the patients responded to the treatment of both groups .
however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of wast@@ e@@ water ( infl@@ ated cav@@ ities in body tissue ) or by infections caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an appeal to the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections were to exceed the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small firm@@ ary , de@@ preci@@ ation or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. to bring approval from Al@@ tar@@ go to the European Union .
patients in which two to three days do not show any improvement , are supposed to be examined again and an alternative therapy is considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a transmitt@@ ing or severe local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the oint@@ ment carefully insp@@ ires and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in clinical trials were the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients suffering from infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy is intended to be considered as an 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment does not enter an improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ onic drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma cent@@ ur@@ ations , which have been reached after top@@ ical application for top@@ ical application or infected @-@ surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is increased from 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on slo@@ ped skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure of top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ is@@ adjustment is not required for a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction level of reproduction after oral intake and are in@@ adequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to an system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
in deci@@ ding whether the breast@@ feeding continued / stopped or termin@@ ates the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , is between the benefit of the nursing and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections that have applied Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effects of irrit@@ ation at the administration , which was about 1 % of the patients .
effect of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance taken by fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein syn@@ thes@@ ize by interaction with a specific binding unit of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial giant of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acts anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding office of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding office and the Pep@@ tide of the Pep@@ tide .
through binding at this binding location , P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line reduces pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ ates , blocking part P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s @-@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms seem to appear , a consultancy should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin next to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults was raised 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on slo@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days in the top@@ ical treatment of secondary @-@ infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the medi@@ ation and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last use .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic absorption in humans according to top@@ ical application of 1 % oint@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the PGP inhibit@@ ing .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there were neither male nor female rats indications of reduced fer@@ til@@ ity in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which reached a maximum exposure of up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure of humans ( top@@ ical application at 200 c@@ m2 )

Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within two doses of existing vacc@@ ines , whereby the protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is assured that the vaccine will lead to an end of two doses .
if a r@@ hy@@ genic dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis C or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by bringing it to the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) , as opposed to an illness .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; alien &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix &apos;s adults and the vaccine Mar@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same illnesses , however , Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix Children are administered within a three doses of existing vacc@@ ines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult parents contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the use of Twin@@ rix grow@@ n@@ s. also used as cover for the Ambi@@ rix application .
the main index for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protective antibody concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix performed at between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection on the development of anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A and B anti @-@ oxid@@ ation cancer .
the additional study showed that the degree of the Ambi@@ rix protection was similar to a six @-@ month gap between injec@@ tions .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , app@@ let defic@@ iency , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ri@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not react in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) to active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) will not be applied .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ises . a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the election , and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a r@@ hy@@ per is desired for Hepatitis A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination .
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis B@@ - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibody are in the same size as after the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured whether immun@@ iz@@ competent individuals who have addressed a request of hep@@ atitis C vacc@@ ination , as they may not be protected by the immune memory .
3 As with all injec@@ tions , for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring can always be available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hep@@ atitis B is needed , the stand@@ ar@@ mp@@ f@@ sch@@ ema is recommended to combine with a combination of combination , the 360 EL@@ ISA units formally contains hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with mal@@ functions of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies , so that in these cases other vacc@@ ines may be required .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimal imp@@ etus to an optimal imp@@ etus , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
however , at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can only inj@@ ure sub@@ cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was born in the second life in the form of a separate injection , with a combined di@@ ph@@ ination , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and hem@@ op@@ hil@@ us type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps vaccine was administered , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects , possibly no adequate response of immune response is possible .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ologists , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the previous thi@@ omer@@ ic and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ination status .
in clinical trials , in total , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to and 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ uring on a calculation basis per vaccine dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 doses .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle there reported 6@@ 6,4 % of subjects that Ambi@@ rix had given profits above pain , compared to 6@@ 3,8 % for subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combinations .
however , the frequency of mat@@ cha was comparable to a height ( i.e. across the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects , the Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6,2 % for subjects that received the 3 @-@ doses combined @-@ combinations ) .
the abundance of pain and mat@@ uring was low and comparable to , which was observed after administration of combination @-@ material with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study at 1 to 11 year @-@ old vacc@@ ines the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that with the 3 @-@ doses of formed hep@@ atitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , during the 6 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old years , the Ambi@@ rix was a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the proportion of vacc@@ inations , which reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of formed hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B - was statist@@ ically not different .
in clinical trials that were carried out in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the serum samples of anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month of 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the exchange rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to a month of 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study that was done at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined @-@ material with three doses .
in the 289 people whose imm@@ unity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose samples .
the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical trial study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ines period ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses with a combination fibre with 360 EL@@ ISA units of formed hep@@ atitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies were detected between the ages of 12 and 15 years after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response in this study was comparable to both anti@@ gens , which was observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination fibre , consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units formed in in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - up to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ ageing and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies could be comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .

a clinical trial carried out with 3 doses of current form@@ ulation in adults was shown for the present form@@ ulation similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ein and serum samples as for previous form@@ ulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the reset on any other partial particles and / or physical changes .

the hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but can also be transferred by other paths such as Baden in the waters of wast@@ e@@ water .
you can feel very tired , have a pale face , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not be fully protected against infection with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ines was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected with Hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus from the administration of both vacc@@ ines and hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) an vacc@@ ination may not prevent one disease .
a protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms resulting in a hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• When your child has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ ching skin rash , breath@@ less or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have occurred once an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly find a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to usually prescribed by the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hep@@ atitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of hep@@ atitis C virus ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a formally in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hep@@ atitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vacc@@ ination with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child to give an vacc@@ ination before the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s own resistance , or if you / your child will undergo a ha@@ em@@ atic cat@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Be of your doctor if you take / take your child additional medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescri@@ ption ) or if you have vacc@@ inated or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and multiple limbs .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ac@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix is not administered to pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women , unless they are vacc@@ inated for Hepatitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B .
important information about specific other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very frequently ( more than 1 case per 10 doses ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at the inser@@ tion or red@@ ness • mat@@ ri@@ ability • head@@ aches • App@@ ear@@ head
♦ often ( up to 1 doses per 10 doses ) : • swelling on the injection line • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Ben@@ om@@ men@@ ness • stomach @-@ intest@@ ine complaints
other side effects , the days or weeks after the vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single substances against hep@@ atitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 imported doses ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of data , which has become known since the first approval of the index , the CH@@ MP re@@ tains the view that the benefit ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix was only placed in a Member State ( the Netherlands since May 2003 ) in traffic , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ i@@ ac concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ium becomes - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed , mixed with food , or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ bu@@ d ( by the abdominal wall ) or a rhin@@ est@@ ones ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , as ammon@@ ium wasn &apos;t compared to any other treatment or placebo ( a p@@ seudo @-@ medicine , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ite can also lead to app@@ let loss , an abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , vom@@ iting , nausea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ium in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ i@@ ac values effectively prevents .
ammon@@ ite was approved under &quot; outstanding circumstances &quot; due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
the use is indicated by all patients who have already manif@@ ested a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ defect , which manif@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy exists .
for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , considering the protein toler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing up to 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest defic@@ iency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ y@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ ase defic@@ iency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the formation of o@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a occurs if the tablets are not immediately going to the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium re@@ tention and eco @-@ forming clinical conditions only with caution .
because met@@ abolic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is done over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore counter@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous form@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down in neur@@ onal verification and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated throughout the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of those unwanted events have been assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ azi@@ azi@@ de , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occ@@ ured for a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ is@@ limit@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity with an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active connection , which con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
stur@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is seen by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative vehicle for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with mal@@ functions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for every gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ lic@@ ated , and the disease carried itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or their st@@ ick@@ ed @-@ free Anal@@ oga in the first year of life to death .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated K@@ ost and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate by post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and the survival rate was diagnosed after the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous bam@@ y@@ las@@ e defic@@ iency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and then treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are already reversible surgical defic@@ its and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is well known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney , whereas phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , the hem@@ og@@ ative inst@@ aller and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites were also examined in cancer patients with an intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking a measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined .
in the majority of patients with cycli@@ c cycli@@ c disorders or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting do not det@@ ectable by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no adverse effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is used to be or@@ ally taken ( infants and children who still have no tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing ) or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ bu@@ d or a rhin@@ est@@ ones .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing up to 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine , and ser@@ um@@ proteins in plasma should be held within the normal area .
in patients suffering from an early manifest defic@@ iency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ y@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , subst@@ itution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat rec@@ orders were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ o by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of pyramid .
an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ azi@@ azi@@ de , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
stur@@ geon poles seen is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds containing 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative support for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations about the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with mal@@ functions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for every gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking a measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
for this purpose , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to obtain the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver properties are missing , so they accum@@ ulate the st@@ ick@@ ening waste products which accum@@ ulate in the body after consumption of proteins .
if you are conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you can use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine may go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases also con@@ di@@ vin@@ ity , head@@ aches , taste problems , offspring of hearing , dis@@ ori@@ ety , memory problems and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states were observed .
if you find one of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you , or you will find side effects that are not stated in this use information .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS must not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the container and the container after &quot; use@@ able up to &quot; specified waste date no longer use .
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS and content of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;

when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS over equal single doses or over a stomach f@@ ist@@ le ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly in the stomach ) or a rhin@@ est@@ ones ( hose that will lead through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take out of a tank a sc@@ oop of gran@@ ulate . • St@@ range from a straight edge , e.g. a knife of the measuring spoon to remove surplus gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules out of the container .
angi@@ ox is applied to treat patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the breast with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - up@@ lift &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who suff@@ ice to a PCI , a higher dose is administered , and in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , with the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in sole gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination therapy with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
while the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the infan@@ try to prevent a closure ) , and they received additionally other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or audit@@ ing ) after 30 days or a year as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients who were subjected to a PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding within which it was much more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox is not used in patients that may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ valent in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it should not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with powerful blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products &quot; ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an acceptable substitute for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission adopted The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd has issued a permit for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ do inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of an emergency attack or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is performed in another episode , an additional bol@@ us should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and increases the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI tests , after clinical requirements , the reduced In@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initi@@ als intraven@@ ous bolt of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one resulting in subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a certain Bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox is not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT by 5 minutes ) to under 225 seconds , a second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constit@@ uted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the bolt daily is rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is not required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , the PCI is handled ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower incidence of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ dness dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second half dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which was conducted in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , which was conducted for approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes following the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .

patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ valent in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant is administered ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though with PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , most of the arter@@ ies of the arter@@ ial points occur , can undergo surgery to patients suffering from per@@ vas@@ cul@@ osis cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while treatment in principle occur everywhere .
in patients who are taken in war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vou@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , should ensure a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) in order to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is reached in front of the treatment existing level .
starting from the knowledge on the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ants ( hep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ants ) can be assumed that these compounds increase bleeding risk .
in each case with the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine and anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters are regularly monitored in any case .
in terms of effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the development or post@@ nat@@ al development are in@@ adequate ( see section 5.3 ) .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , teenagers and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin for the provision of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or can not process insulin .
insulin is very slightly different from Human@@ ity , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter activity duration than a short @-@ term human@@ ist .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can not produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main index for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ co@@ li@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with a@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be applied in patients who are possibly sensitive to insulin or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ ogly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra needs to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the de@@ contamination or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal wall .
due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin changes , the insulin requirement can be reduced in patients with restriction of liver function .
any change of action , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin delivery ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may vary a change of insulin .
3 A in@@ adequate dos@@ ing or termination of treatment , particularly in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ atory diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a di@@ abe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these conditions are potential life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin delivery should be performed under str@@ ingent supervision and may be necessary to change dosage .
the time of hyp@@ ogly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the activity profile of the is@@ lan@@ ders and can therefore change from changing the treatment schem@@ as .
to enhance the substances that increase blood sugar levels and rein@@ force the inc@@ lin@@ ation to hyp@@ ogly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics , angi@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , fluor@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ics , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiot@@ ics .
additionally , under the effect of symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pin , the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ gen anti@@ bodies are weak@@ ened or missing .
in clinical studies of reproduction , no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ity showed in relation to pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin is not related to breast milk , nor is it absor@@ bing after oral application .

severe hyp@@ ogly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ately trained person , or treated by an intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a physician .
after a glu@@ ing injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the urine cause for severe hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by blocking the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be faster by insulin @-@ use of insulin delivery faster and the duration of operation is shorter than for hu@@ - man@@ ic normal .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes m@@ li@@ - T@@ US , insulin @-@ detection of a dose of proportional glu@@ ing effect , and with 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the glucose level effect , just like humanity .
insulin has twice as fast active effect as normal human metabolism and delivers the full glu@@ ed impact of about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
data from the data was evident that at an application of is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached , as with human normal insulin , which is 30 minutes before meal .
if insulin was processed in 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given as with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if insulin is charged 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 billion gro@@ oves before meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the start of meal was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of meal was given ( Figure 1A ) , as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
