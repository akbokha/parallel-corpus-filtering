<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Consultation Report (EPAR), in which it is explained as the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP), in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the pack of packages (also part of the EPAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirling thinking and speech, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder, alternately have abnormal atmosphere (periods of abnormal atmosphere) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for treating moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, solution to intake or melting tablets can be applied in patients with the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works above all as "partial Agents" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin can play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby decreasing psychotic or manic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, resembling the symptoms occur, has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which were at gested unrest, compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which have been stabilized to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms have been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which compared to increased unrest, associated with the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients showed a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to take absorbs (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution of patients who received the Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms caused more unrest than patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying the bipolar disorder, Abilify was reduced in four of the five short-time studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks when placebo was able to reproduce manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms caused by unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), acididynia (dizziness), acidification (dizziness), slap (dizziness), memory-hypersecretion (increase in memory), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products "(CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to heavy manic episodes in patients who mainly had manic episodes, with which the manic episodes spoke to the treatment with Aripiprazol, against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee also came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to sustain the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the transport of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a therapeutic or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to greater sensitivity of these patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered in consideration when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripirazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides behavioral behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disturbances and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing of antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic in epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder showed no increased suiciality of risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be applied with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about during treatment with Aripirazol occurring dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinesis should be drawn into consideration, decrease the dose or break treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs signs and symptoms resulting in a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all Antipsychotics must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with varicans in the anamozoa or at states that are related to varicans in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, increased death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however in some of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripianzol patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases, extremly and associated with ketoazione or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related unwanted events in patients treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs, which allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in regards to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with Bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, resp. an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overlaid side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, whereby this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have to be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 will result in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensible metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should sustain the potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteinase inhibitors, might have similar effects and therefore should make similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosing of ABILIFY should be lifted to the dosing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">In common with ABILIFY, diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be used with a moderate increase of arithmetic concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextromethyl / 3-methodxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (warfarin) and 3A4 (dextromethyl) and 3A4 (dextromethyl).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify her doctor if pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of the human being and because of the concerns in the animal's concerns, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against operated hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are safe that Aripiprazol has no adverse influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than either placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinesia were compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripirazol treatment and 13.1% were in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripirazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters appeared, yielded no medical differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements in Cpk (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with arithmetic patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">In addition to the side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptor syndrome, late dyskinakia, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch were unintended or deliberate overdose associated with Aripiprazol alone in adult patients with an estimated content of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemostsis in treating a overdose of Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is in the treatment of an overdose of use, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma attachment.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder over the combination of a partial protagonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptor is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergen and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers showed a dosing-dependent reduction in the liaison of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligament, on Nucleus caudatus and the Putting.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial, in week 52 the share of the respondence was similar to the study medication, similar to both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depressions-scale, showed significantly stronger recovery than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% were found under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study involved in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients underwent a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca. 30%).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week, Aripiprazol also showed a similar share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which was partially transmitted to Lithium- or Valproat-Monotherapy, with a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to the Monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period above 74 weeks in manic patients who showed a remission with Aripiprazol compared to placebo in front of the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in prevention of a relapse in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydration and hydration of Aripiprazol which is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The median steamation time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol for extensible metabolites on CYP2D6 and at nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients have no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics found no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking at the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney disease in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with various abnormal liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security spharmacology, toxicity in repeated treatment, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and for petrol-balanced potential, the pre-clinical data recognizes no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed merely by dosages or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosing or exposure of people, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects resulted in a dosisdependency channel (AUC) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the recommended maximum dose of humans) and an increase by concnierenal gland / carcinoma during female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times of the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose when people are recommended).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of Sulphate conjuids of Aripiprazol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose dose or from 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations in human gall found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. of found concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol not more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages resulting in exprespositions of 3- and 11fold in the middle bar-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, whereby this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In comparison to CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, like Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, might have similar effects and therefore should make similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="160">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosing of ABILIFY should be lifted to the dosing height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>

<seg id="164">107 The following side effects appeared more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were listed in clinical trials with oral-consuming Aripiprazol as possible medical-relevant effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% were in patients under placebo.</seg>

<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients under Aripirazol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters appeared, yielded no medical differences.</seg>

<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was compared with statistically significantly larger improvements of agitivity / behavioural problems compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with Bipolar disorder as well as agitivity and behavioural disorders, the Aripirazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed average improvement of the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score with the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5,8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agitivity, a similar effectiveness was observed in terms of total population, but an statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (orally) showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial, in week 52 the share of the respondence was similar to the study medication, similar to both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (orally) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>

<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks, followed by a 74-week study from a 74-week study before Randomization, Aripiprazol was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in prevention of a relapse in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is in the first 2 hours after intramuscularly injection 90% higher than AUC according to the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>

<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (orally) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated treatment, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and for petrol-balanced potential, the pre-clinical data recognizes no particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed merely by dosages or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosing or exposure of people, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects resulted in a dosisdependency channel (AUC) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the recommended maximum dose of humans) and an increase by tributenal rinds / carcinoma during female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the middle bar Steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose when humans are recommended).</seg>

<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100); frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lacuncture hydrogenase in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dyspheragie, blacks, tongue burning, dry mouth, pains of gums, loose stools, tulophagitis, pain in the lower body, orale pain, reoctal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the breast-wall, weakness of muscles, abdominal pain, pain-pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeleton muscles, foothills, discomfort in the limbs, muscular weakness.</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there was no causal connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubules drug, which promotes the condensation of the microtubules from the tubes and the microtubules stabilized by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is well known that albumin conveys the transzytosis of Plasma components in the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of Paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albume receptors and due to the albuminbic protein SPARC (pted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation appears in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-censored studies and of 454 patients that were treated in a randomised phase III comparison study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, as a 3-hour infusion with prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2, as a 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In inclusion in the study 64% of the patients had an impaired public condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasia.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy yet, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastases and 19% due to metastases and adjuvant treatment.</seg>

<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity vs Paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement in a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy an peripheral neuropathy grade 3 was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural process of peripheral neuropathy for demolition on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80-375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure exposure (AUC) increased from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 As an intravenous gift from Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration increased from multi-phase plasma.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has an extensive outtravascular supply and / or incline binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after a solvent containing Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was Abraxane Higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue-coating is reported that Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized in 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and into two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel) and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value of the unaltered drugs amounted to 4% of the total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, resulting in an extensive non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">Over the age of more than 75 years, however, only few data are available, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active substance (also called "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood irradiation which may occur in connection with blood transfusion complications, if the surgery is not possible prior to the procedure, and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor, which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases affecting the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood-bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be made by the patient or staff member unless they have received an appropriate manual.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobinars should always be at the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilites in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and ice energy agents should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients suffering from chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by a erythropoietindeficiency or thus, that the body does not adequately address the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell produced in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of epetine alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was diagnosed as an injection in a Vene as part of a main study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">In all patients participating in this study, Eprex / Erypo had been injected into a Vene before they were either switched to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the change in hemoglobinars between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">Furthermore, the company also filed the results of a study in which the effects of injected abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were examined by those of Eprex / Erypo for 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobinations were converted to Abseamed were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison to this, patients who continue Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0,063 g / dl of output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, pervous migraine and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed cannot be applied in patients that may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against epetine alfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that they are caused by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products "(CHMP) reached the conclusion that a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile, such as Eprex / Erypo, was established in accordance with the provisions of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which presents Abseamed, will provide information on the medical expert in all Member States, including information about the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="386">Initial symptoms and follow-up may vary depending on the age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease by the physician may be required.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoguglobins by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobinations can be observed occasionally, or under the hemoglobin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobinvariability, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) can be reached until 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobinbines increased by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or exceeds the lasting hemoglobinge 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epine alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be controlled engmatically, in order to ensure that epetine alfa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of anaemia and angioplasty symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) possibly require higher yields than patients, where the initial anemia is less heavy (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) possibly require higher levels of maintenance (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="397">Patients should be controlled engmatically, in order to ensure that epetine alfa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of intolatory symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the treatment of hemoglobinaries is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the labulocyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be maintained at 150 I.U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If hemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the tikulocyte count &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If, after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 i.e / kg three times a week the hemoglobin capacity increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained at 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">In contrast, the hemoglobinaries is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the tikulocyte number around &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, is an address to the epetine alfa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the preventive storage of ≥ 4 blood canned is required should be obtained twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgery procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">With the Iron substitution should be made as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donors program - so that before the start of the Abseam therapy, large iron reserves are available.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epetine, which should be given weekly over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgery and the day of the surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">On this occasion, epetine alfa preoperatively 300 i.E. / kg should be given in each ten consecutive days, on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="412">If the tikulocyte value is normal considering the anaemia (i.e. the colcyte and leukozytenance), thrombocyte and leukozytenance should be normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be analysed and an investigation of bone structure on the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data for immunogenicity at subcutaneous use of Abseamed for patients with a risk of anti-physically induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic renal insufficiency should not be exceeded the recommended limit of the hemoglobin target concentrations in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality rate and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed if Erythropoese stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin- target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit, which is attributable to the gift of epoxy symptoms, when hemoglobination concentration above the concentration of intranal symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions concentration.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobinism should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidenant coronarer heart failure or dust insufficiency should not exceed the recommended limit of hemoglobin target concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to this knowledge, knowledge of anemia is not accelerated due to the treatment of anaemia in adults with renal insufficiency, not dialysis, progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">When cancer patients suffering from chemotherapy should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of epetine alfa a 2 - 3-week delay between epetine-alfa-gift and the erythropoetin-answer (patients who need to be transfounded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapieved anaemia - Dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping hemoglobinism between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision on the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit risk reduction under the involvement of the respective patients, which should also consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for larger elective orthopedic surgery, if possible, examines the cause of anaemia before the beginning of the epochal-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients suffering from a larger elective orthopedic surgery should have an increased risk of thrombosis, as they have increased risk of thrombotic and vascularious diseases, especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that treatment with Epoetine alfa for patients with an increased risk of &gt; 13 g / dl a increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vasculars may exist.</seg>

<seg id="643">Patients who were classified by the end of the six-month primary study as responding to therapy, could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and 107 with Risedronate treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach to the patients with Aclasta, compared with 71 of the patients treated with Risedronate, could be maintained in the middle duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiples of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledronylic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosisindependently.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration after time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by cytochrome P450-Enzymers metabolized substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized at humans and because they are not a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin-Clearance, and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function up to a creatinin-Clearance to 35 ml / min requires no dose of toledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Due to severe kidney function (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Consultation Report (EPAR), in which it is explained as the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP), in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes), where metformin (particularly overweight patients) can be applied. • It can be applied together with another diabetic medication (dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">Additionally, it can be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) which cannot be satisfactory in the highest proportionable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulphylharnstoff or insulin, the old dose of the sulfa drugs may be maintained, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfa drugs or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be enhanced and the blood sugar level decreases, reducing type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of acetone in Tripletherapy has been studied; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylharnstoff, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, concentration of a substance in the blood (glycoliated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which insisted that blood sugar levels have been lowered from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of acetone and a sulfonylharnstoff in a decrease of the HbA1c values decreased by 0.94% while the additional gift of placebo led to a lowering of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study included in the combination of acettos and insulin from 289 patients, patients who increased acetone in addition to insulin, a decrease of the HbA1c values from 0.69% to 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to acettos were disorders of the upper respiratory disorders (cold), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied to patients who may respond to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic Ketoazione (high concentration level - acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients when metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission announced the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited, a permit for the transport of Actos throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and incompatible with which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">To use Pioglitazon for patients under 18 years of age no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and odema when Pioglitazon in combination with insulin is applied.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular income study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of age type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrorovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports about heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit) or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to the 3 times the maximum limit of the normal range are increased, the Liver Enzymes are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms developed which point to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upscale pain, tiredness, appetite and / or dark Harn, are the liver nymers to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient was continued with Pioglitazon, should be managed by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dosum-dependent weight gain was proven, which may stir from grease deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid tention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a Häeplitazon, a minor reduction in the middle hemoglobinar (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in similar controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under Metformin (relative reduction in hemogualum by 3-4%) and to a lower extent also in patients under Sulphylharnstoff and insulin (relative reduction in hemoglobins by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitive skin consists of patients who receive Pioglitazon as an oral dual or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">According to the market launch, Thiazolidindices, including Pioglitazon, was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there are direct connection between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but tempting doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular hole. a suitable ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of randomized reports of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years in the patients treated with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient-patient with women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this happens, treatment is reset (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs, metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, Cyclosporine, calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA-reductasinhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in lowering the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable that under treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperactivity levels and increased insulin resistant in pregnancy and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fatalal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; rare &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (do not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-attachments also frequently appeared as compared to placebo, but less commonly compared to placebo but less than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulphylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with existing advanced macular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure was less than under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazon respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch a lot of heart failure was reported under Pioglitazon, more often, when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the history of the history.</seg>
<seg id="795">It became a summarizing analysis of randomised incidents in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated in the groups treated with comparative mediation patients.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years running PROACTIVE study, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears to work on an activation of specific receptors (peroxanomas Proliferation / receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitive insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral vigour in the case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus gliclazid as Monotherapy has been continued over two years to examine the time up to the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was randomised to randomised in spite of the three-phase optimizing phase with insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the median of HbA1c fell by 0.45%, compared to the patients who still only received insulin; a reduction of the insulin production in the patients treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year under Pioglitazon a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin Quotienten compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Montherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week test of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction in the plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and a slight rise, but clinically not significantly increased LDL-Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while under Metformin and Gliclazid have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks reduced Pioglitazon not only the sober-triglycerides, but also improved also the postprandial increased triglycerides, this can be applied to the triglyceride absorption as well as to hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular research study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrorovascular disease were randomised to receive existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment in either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, with the top concentration of the unaltered Pioglitazone in plasma normally 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV equals the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon could not be found relevant to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8-Inhibitor) or with Rificicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive Pioglitazon in humans the marker was found mainly in the decay (55%) and a lower degree in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The median plasma-elimination time of unaltered Pioglitazon amounts to 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolism is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearing of dams were similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and apes coincided with repeated plasmavolume enlargement with hemostar, anaemia, and reversibly eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable that under the treatment of Pioglitazon is diminished in the gestation of hyperopuline and increased insulin resistant, which reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fatalal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family-binding polyposis (FAP) the treatment performed with two other thiazolidindices to an increased frequency of colonies.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years in the patients treated with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient-patient with women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined with each Pioglitazone or Gliclazid respectively.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin Quotiente compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober-triglycerides, but also enhanced the postprandial increased triglycerides, this has an effect on the Tryglyceride absorption and also on hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target of its primary endpoint, a combination of the overall mortality, stroke, acute coronarine syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, put the results closely linked to taking Pioglitazon no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the markings "45" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of randomised analysis of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon, showed an increased incidence of bone fragmentation with women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the sober-triglycerides, but also enhanced the postprandial increased triglycerides, this has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as to hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="872">The injection pin must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar refinement has significantly improved, for example, can be perceived by hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be debated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphassic, long-acting insulin, human insulin or insulin analogue) and / or production method (due to recombinant DNA) can result in a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">In case of moving to Actraphane in patients a dosing adjustment is required, it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions have occurred after a change of animal insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travel, which go over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor, since such travels can cause insulin and meals that have to be taken and taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor should therefore consider possible interactions in therapy and should always be questioned to others of them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Pohl Hypoglycaemia, as well as hyperglycemia, which may occur at a non-controlled Diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>

<seg id="886">However, hypoglycemia can develop continuously: • Easy hypoglycaemia can be treated by oral sugars or glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugar fruit juice with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid sperson or by glucose, which is given intravenously by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in the European Union, the company recorded data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also carried out a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D reflections.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment the share of patients with low vitamin D levels had been treated with patients who had been treated with ADROVANCE, lower (11%) than those that are exclusively Alendronate. (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data to indicate that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common adverse events (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculosis (muscles, bones, or joints) and symptoms of digestive devices such as abdominal pain, dyspun (diarrhea), ulcers, diarrhoea (swallowing), broken abdomen (recess stomach) as well as acid.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Ösophageal reactions, such as Ösophagitis, Pophageal ulcera and ösophageal vantions, were rarely reported in patients under the consumption of Alendronat (partially these were severe and required a hospital instruction).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore observe attention to any signs and symptoms that are pointed out to potential offophageal reactions such as dyspheragia, pain when swallowing or retrospecular pain or new or deteriorating sodburn the medicine and take care of medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe Agophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or according to the occurrence of symptoms that refer to a Pophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed to the patient and are understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with clinical trials have shown that the proportion of Alendronat, which is not deposited in the bone, is rapidly deposited beyond the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data is above, it is expected to be expected to reduce the renal elimination of alendronat as in animal experiments as well in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore in patients with reduced kidney function, an increased cumulation of alendronat can be expected in the bone (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosusive therapy and treatment of transplant cancer should be assigned to this medicine or make changes in immunosusive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this may lead to transplanting or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immune suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacromus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of formulation or regimes should only be carried out under the thorough control of a medical device (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a changeover to an alternative wording, a therapeutic drug control and corresponding dosing adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dose of Advagraf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of separation and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After the conversion of Prograf to Advague, the Tacrolimus Talm should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspection of Tacrolimus-Talmirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advague to ensure adequate substance-exposure to immediate transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf-dosisschemas can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Recommended Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advague must be converted from Prograf capsules twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf so this conversion has taken place at a daily dose of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney cleanse and liver transplantation After a transition from other immunosuva on Advague once daily has to start treatment with the recommended oral dose for prophylaxis of transplant repulsion.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant for adult patients who be converted to Advague is an oral initiation dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day every day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplants were probably no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pankreas- and darmtransplanted patients received prograf patients in an oral initiation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initiation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initiation of 0.3 mg / kg / day for application.</seg>
<seg id="1428">In special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions a substitute of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose may not be required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of renal function (including the regular determination of the serum levels) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advague When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to Talking in full blood The dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of separation and tolerability in individual cases under condition of full-blood Tacrolimus-Talmal Controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common checks of the Tacrolimus valley during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood pressure levels from Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advague, Dosage customization, changes of immunocervical cancer, which could be controlled by Tacrolimus (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advague is a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">According to clinical trials, the data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talrolim cells lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with garnish-transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent treatment of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This led to serious adverse events including transplanting or other side effects, which may occur in sequence of Tacrolimus or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacromus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of formulation or regimes should be carried out only under the close control of a medical device (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplant repulsion, proven to other immunosuva as therapy-resistant, there are no clinical data for retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In the prophylaxis of transplant suppression in adult heart transplants and graft, no clinical data for retarded formulation is present before.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which may lead to a substitute of tactical levels in blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, is the intake of herbal compound, the currants (hypericum perforatum), or other plant drugs during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea a particularly careful monitoring of the blood flow concentrations are offered in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subjected to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, Prograf was observed in rare cases called Kardiomyopathy that can be observed as Kardiomyopathy that can thus occur under Advague.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such sounding disorders is an existing heart disease, treatment with cortistereroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, liquid flow and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuva, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunshield with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicinal products which are known as inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can increase the metabolism of Tacrolimus, and consequently increase blood levels from Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrogenital blood levels in the simultaneous gift of substances that enable the CYP3A metabolism to monitor and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintaining consistent concentrations accordingly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A highly pronounced interaction was made with antifungotics such as Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Iconconazole and voriconazole and with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies resulted in the increase of blood levels mainly resulting from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal perspiration, results.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosified prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as it is used in acute removal reactions, can increase or lower concentration of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism can affect metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can minimize the Clearance of steroid contraceptive and thus increase hormonal exposure, is particularly careful when making decisions regarding receptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus can reduce the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazon and whose half-time can extend.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of investigations on transplant cancer provide no note that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immune suppressiva, is an increased risk of unwanted events involving the course and the result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It has been reported using benign or malignant Neoplasmen including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumor in connection with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high bonds of erythrocytes and plasma samples can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialysible.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level might be conveyed by the effects of Tacrolimus (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematocrite and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound faction of Tacrolimus, or being responsible through treatment with cortideeroids, or being responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before the excretion, with the excretion mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients who were taken from Prograf (twice a day) at Advague (once a day) in relation to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was nearly 10% lower than prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one by the lack of factor VIII unrelated, innate bleeding).</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and incidence of application will be addressed, whether advances to treat bleeding or prevention of hemorrhages in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cladding to joints, muscles, or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method called "recombinant DNA-technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell produced in which a gene (DNA) has been incorporated into the formation of the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union named Recombinate, but it's produced differently, so that drug may contain no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with serious to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding or surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the effectiveness of advances in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood levels was received with "excellent" or "good".</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Lawyers may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against human scent factor VIII, Maus- or hamsters, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG to grant approval for authorisation of lawyers in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy are based on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, after the place and the extent of blood and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">With the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII-activity should not fall under the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the danger is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment, it is used to control the administered dose and the frequency of injections an appropriate determination of the factor VIII-Plasmasmirgel.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vivo recovery and have different halves.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmacan do not be reached or if the bleeding is not ruled out with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to assign an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The conversion speed should be set up after the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG Immaclobuline, who quantify in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Developing the risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the magnitude of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk depends on the biggest and other factors within the first 20 Exposition days.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposures and anamneically-known inhibitors, after the conversion of a recombinant factor VIII, it was observed for another, replay of (lowest titres) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare setbacks of hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1556">In the largest number of patients receiving ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), who have previously untreated patients who have been higher risk for the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100), frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rare (frequency on the basis of the available data not invaluable).</seg>

<seg id="1559">Blood clots was sustained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 postoperable day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with a companion heavier Hämophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrations (≥ 150 days) showed only one patient after 26 expositions with ADVATE a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 papdiatric patients with an old age of 6 years and a companion severe to moderate Hämophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) was diagnosed after prior exposure against factor VIII- concentration rates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial, 5 of 25 (20%) treated patients with ADVATE were treated against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contaminated protein was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against such proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a prolonged peak of antibodies against anti-Cho-cell protein, otherwise, no signs or symptoms occured on an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients, on the occurrence of Urtikaria, Pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophiler Granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions in the study.</seg>

<seg id="1636">Rare side effects since the introduction of the drug on the market has been appalled by severe and potentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis) and other allergic reactions (see above).</seg>
<seg id="1637">156 In the case of bloodshed, the factor of VIII in the corresponding period of time should not fall under the specified plasma activity (in% or in I.U. / ml).</seg>
<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval, CHMP continues to be considered positive, but considered that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is based on the basis of the safety filter of ADVATE, which is necessary to submit a further renewal process to the filing of PSURs every 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited distributed the Committee for Medicinal Products "(CHMP), with that the company takes its application for authorization to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">However, the breast, the brain, bones, or pasture parts (tissues, which combines other structures in the body, are affected and relies on).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus, genetically modified so it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which was so changed that it does not produce any copies of itself, and therefore no infections can trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Adexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancer cells to form a normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defect in the human body existing p53 gene is usually induced to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA can not be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study involving a patient, with the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of sublification, bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP has examined the answers of the company on which questions asked him, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial documentation, the CHMP created a list of questions that will be sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumors will bring benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of drug in the body, the kind of administration as well as the safety of drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company won't know the CHMP in consideration of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients are currently taking part in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered drugs release" means that the tablets are thus composed so that one of the effective components is instantly released and the other slowly released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen protrued inflammation of the nose) in patients with nose-mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible, as soon as the symptoms, above all the swelling of the nose-mucosa (clogged nose), are cloned.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the severity of gravity of the hypocrushing symptoms occurring by the patient prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated them with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all Heuvella symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported the patients who received Aerinaze's income, compared to a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who are sipseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relieving of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who lost Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side-effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedometer, dizziness, dizziness, dizziness, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia (insomnia), insomnia, insomnia (insomnia), insomnia, and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against Desloratadine, Pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adrenerous drugs or Loratadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow-angle glaucoma (hypertension), hypertension (hypertension), hypertension, or already a hemorrhagic stroke (blood circulation caused stroke) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to permit a permit for the inflows of Aerinaze in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, to swallow (i.e. without biting or cut off).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data to infinity and efficacy (see Section 5.1), it should not be applied for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of application is as short as possible and should not be continued after crashes of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days, since at long time use the activity of Pseudoephedrine at time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment with desloratadine can continue as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with monoamine oxidase (Mao) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphthalmic activity in combined use of pseudoephine, pergolid, lurid, lurid, carcinydroergotamine or other deongestiva, hydrochlorothine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective, and the data are not enough to express appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function, and data are not enough to express appropriate recommendations on dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or tachycarats or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or reinforcement of the headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients suffering from cardiovascular disease • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamozoa, diabetes mellitus, bladder construction or bronchospasm in the history of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to conclude at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines may otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="1679">As part of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or Ketoconazole were given additionally, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor tests could no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and those treated with placebo patients, regardless of whether desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This enzyme has not yet been identified for the Metabolism of Desloratadin, so that interaction with other medicines may not be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibited in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconceivable application of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies however no increase in frequency of abnormalities as compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since Reproduction studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and based on vasoconstrictor properties of Pseudoephedrine should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should, however, be clarified, that in very rare cases, it can lead to a benefit of decency or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished spiritual attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular colonies) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, sore muscles, muscular weakness, muscular insufficiency, euphylcardie, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, cordious pain, dizziness, tinnitus, atrium, eye disturbances, and hypertonia or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially probable in children, just like atropin typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil rigid and - dilucation, hood, hyperthermia, hyperthermia, hyperthermia, hyperthermia, hyperthermia).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastic cells / bass helds as well as inhibition of expression of the Adjunsionolecule P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the amplification of subjective hits or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Oral application of Pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause further sympathetic effects, such as increasing blood pressure, a tachykarmic or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1.248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies histamantagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determines from the total cores for the symptoms (except nose-loops), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, measured using the nose-mucskin, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in relation to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable in the plasma within 30 minutes after the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze on healthy subjects over 14 days, the assembly-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and Pseudoephedrine has been reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosdosse study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects suffered from Desloratadine badly.</seg>
<seg id="1700">One component intervention study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine in the sole gift of Pseudoephedrine in bioequivalent was to the gift of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security spharmacology, for toxicity in repeated treatment, for recovery and reproductive toxicity, however, the pre-clinical data with desloratadin can not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no bigger toxicity as its individual components, and the observed effects were generally found in connection with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproduciously clinical trials the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day was not teratogenic.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the approval application described pharmacovigilance system and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamine contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance that can unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieving symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hypocrisps), such as sneezing, runny or itching eyes, or itching eyes while still clogging the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart attacks, stomach pain, diarrhea, dizziness, dizziness, dizziness, dizziness, dizziness, pain disorders, loss of liver illness, more cases of liver disease and over cases of conspicuous liver analysis was also very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- and 5 mg of tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children ages one to five years the dose is 1.25 mg. a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup and syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children from six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup and syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was involved in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with an allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by changing the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of quadrelling, impairment of sleep and performance on days) and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to insert and melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all trials were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius were observed for the average decrease of the symptom (mentionpoints) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria decrease the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied in patients that may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, Loratadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe to permit approval from Aerius to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergy) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials to the effectiveness of desloratadin from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be terminated according to previous clinical symptoms and can be resumed after the end of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persistent allergy symptoms (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the everyday period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or Ketoconazole were given additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, treating amerius and alcohol is not amplified the efficient effects of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases it can be used to benefit from perfiable traffic or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergy rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius when treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly used side effects, which was reported more frequently than in placebo were tiredness (1,2%), oral drone (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect headaches that occurred at 5.9% of the patients who were treated with desloratadin and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving up to 45 mg of desloratadin (ninety clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastic cells / bass helds as well as inhibition of expression of the Adjunsionolecule P-seltin on endothelialcells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multi-technical problems, the Desloratadin has been administered up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the Desloratadine a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dosage) was administered over ten days, showed no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosing study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the amplification of subjective hits or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis was Aerius effective in treating the symptoms like Niesen, Nasensecretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacriages and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified as an intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermitting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week, more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown using the total cores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-ligtivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was inconceivable for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar to the etiology, similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited much easier.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a causal factor in all urarial diseases, it is expected that Desloratadin is also reported in other forms of urticaria in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of prejuitus and the reduction of size and number of quadrye at the end of the first dose-intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistamines, were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching over 50% was observed at 55% of patients with desloratadin treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disorder of sleep and wax, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonally allergic rhinitis -population was achieved at 4% of patients a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant Kumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days before.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, this enzyme has not yet been identified for the Metabolism of Desloratadin, so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded entirely.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibited in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosisation study with Desloratadin a dosage of 7,5 mg, meals (fatty food, low-oriented breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials carried out with desloratadin and Loratadin carried out clinical trials in a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity of Desloratadin and from Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security spharmacology, toxicity in repeated treatment, genotoxicity and for reproduction, the preclinical data with Desloratadin cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmine (E 132), colourless film (includes Hypromless, Macrogol 400), Carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, for relieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data can be found which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with anerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to exclusion of respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and related laboratory studies should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabolized by Desloratadin and learn a higher amount of substitution (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 who metabolized, is identical to the children who metabolize normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorpation or sucrose-isomaltas- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or Ketoconazole were given additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, treating Aerius tablets and alcohol is not amplified the efficient effects of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total threading of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as compared to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and youngsters in different indications, including allergy rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius when treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in an adult dose of adults and adolescents, with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (ninety clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years old, who were born for an antihistamine therapy, received daily desloratadjunk of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin could be extrapolated in adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple people in adults and adolescents, the Desloratadine has been used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and youngsters, in the Desloratadine used in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dosage) was applied more than ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents is no incidence of drowsiness in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">For a single daily dose of 7,5 mg, Aerius tablets of adults and adolescents in clinical studies have no impairment of psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinically-pharmacological studies on adults, it caused by simultaneous consumption of alcohol neither to a amplification of alcohol-induced power impair even to increase drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis were Aerius tablets effectively in relieving symptoms like Niesen, Nasensecretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacriages and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown using the total cores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-ligtivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduces the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of prejuitus and the reduction of size and number of quadrye at the end of the first dose-intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1784">This reduced metabolious phenotyps was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with an allergic rhinitis, observed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was approximately 6times higher and the Cmax approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a set-up time of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no evidence of any clinically relevant active ingredient Kumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In different single dose studies, AUC- and Cmax values of Desloratadin were found in pediatric patients with the recommended doses comparable to those of adults who received Desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic appears when a new strain of the influenza virus emerges, which can easily spread by humans, because people have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the parts contained in the vaccine from the influenza virus as "physically alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Thereby, the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in a contact with an influenza virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Then the membrane hulls of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membranes) was separated, cleaned and cleaned as a component of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Afraase is available as a solution for import, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which the patient has previously taken antiviral drugs to the patient, and the likelihood has evaluated the virus to address the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral pharmaceuticals twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral pharmaceuticals, Agenerase reduces the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not able to cure AIDS, however, the damage of the immune system, and thus also the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This was compared with low dosed Ritonavir reinforced medicine Agenerase by 206 adults who used previously protease inhibitor with other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-demonstrable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but with the children that previously had been treated with protease inhibitors, were very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who previously had been treated with protease inhibitors, the virus was effectively treated with Ritonavir reinforced drugs Ageneration after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients suffering from HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of Viruslast after four weeks than in the patient receiving their previous protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flarrhoea (blood circulation), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products "(CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral pharmaceuticals to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee set out that the benefit of acar in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously no protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally licensed under "outstanding circumstances," as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited to bring approval to funds from Agenerase throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is combined in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor (PI) pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">To usually, Agenerated capsules are to be administered to the pharmacokinetic boosting with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ambigavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance and pretreatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ampriavir as a solution for intake is 14% less than the capsule; therefore, Agenerated capsules and solution for intake are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerated capsules is 600 mg Ampriavir twice daily with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerated capsules are applied without the amplified additive of Ritonavir (booths), doses of Agenerated (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerated capsules is 20 mg Ampriavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Ampriavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aspirase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease agents were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data for infinity and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1973">The treatment with Eefirenz in combination with Ampriavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would serious.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin to other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Neviraps might be reduced to the serum concentration of amatavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If the medicine should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtle plasma diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these treatments are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virology monitoring should be carried out, as an accurate forecast for the effect of the combination of ambigavir and Ritonavir is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ampriavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma centration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193% and thus an increase in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin together with Agenerase is required to reduce the dosage of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with Erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of the simultaneous administration.</seg>

<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenera with Ritonavir is not recommended together with these Glukokortikoids, unless the possible use of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cortiqueroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose contaminating is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to increase influx of the plasma levels at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma increases of these HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor to myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these medicines will not be recommended using Amapavir.</seg>

<seg id="1992">Therefore, aiase may not be used together with oral midazolam (see Section 4.3), while using the same application of aemase with parenteral Midazolam beware is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteinase inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Midazolam, 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amdetavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatric symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the lesser reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the moment, how the ambigavir dose is administered simultaneously with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">While simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, an increased control of INR (International normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or strengthening of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods are recommended to the receptionality.</seg>

<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always move the current interpretations to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypical resistance tests, clinical analytically validated analysis systems can be used in combination with genotypic data for estimation of the activity of ambigavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease-resistent isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have clinically developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (partitions) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amatavir associated genetic patterns generates a certain Crusader against Ritonavir, sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir, however, remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There is currently data to cross-resistence between ambigavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamper avir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral no pre-treated patients with which a Fosampavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), caviavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), caviavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), caquincavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tipbabor / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tiprancavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), and type caviavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amdetavir retains its activity against some other protease-resistant isolates; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the insates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early termination of an versal therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a multitude of mutations in limits which may affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The receipt of effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017 twice daily) with Ritonavir (100mg twice daily) and Nukleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily covered with the lowly Ritonavir, "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Ageneration, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the sub-study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis provided the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in relation to the period adjusted average of the output value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-slip shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of efficacy of unbleached Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 with PI had been treated.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution for intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosified Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of PI treated with PI had previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study included plasma-HIV-1 RNA of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell number from 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered during treatment optimization with PI in treated children of the expected benefit of "unbundled" ecstasy.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the medium length (Tmax) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase for Cmax, by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) administered together with ambigavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ampriavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of ambigavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was impacted by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is about 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be tied to a large share volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amabbr from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the active concentration in the plasma, with the amount of unbound ambigavir that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amabbaboo constantly remains constant, the percentage of the free active ingredient during the metering intervalls in the Steady State on the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce CYP3A4 should be inhibited or inhibited or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution given to be given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amyphavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ampriavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore Agenerase solution and Agenerated capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammbase.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal dysfunction might be low on the elimination of Ampriavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatments are comparable to amatavir plasma welding, which are achieved twice daily, after a dose of 1200 mg Ampriavir twice daily, without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity with amicavir in mice and rats competed with male animals benigne hepatocell Adenome with dosages based on the people, following twice daily allowance of 1200 mg Ampriavir, said.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocell ular adenoma and carcinomas were not clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data on people, both clinical trials and therapeutic use, however, have little evidence for adopting a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro diagnostics tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse-lymphoma test, microkernel analysis in rats and chromosomination test on human peripheral lymphocytes were included, was Ampriavir neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity in patients were observed, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals that were treated from a age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the amatavir treated animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma presentation, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage compared to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeleton changes were observed, which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerated capsules are applied without the amplified additive of Ritonavir (booths), doses of Agenerated (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerated capsules is 20 mg Ampriavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Ampriavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use of patients with weak or mild liver function should be done with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International norm Ratio), are available methods for determining the concentration of active concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2231">The approved indications expressions utterance, actinic keratosis and superfizial cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream has been studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies with the dosages there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic absorption of the 5% imiquimod-cream due to the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug conconcentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totalled 0.1, 0.2, and 1,6 ng / ml in the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and in the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated interim period lay approximately 10times higher than the 2hour half-time after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates a prolonged retention of drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod was low after the toponic application of patients aged 6-12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superstructural basis cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four month study on the paint toxicity at the rat used doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg significantly reduced body weight and increased Milz weight; one also performed four months for the paint application showed no similar effects during the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice was induced by three days a week, no tumors placed at the use of the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption of human skin, and does not fail, is a risk for people due to systemic exposure as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumors were present in the group of mice that was treated with the real-free cream, previously and in larger numbers than in the control group with minimal UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was mainly investigated, but its effectiveness was also measured by reducing its effect in relation to the reduction in Gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme increased the Gag concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions on the infusion location.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachykardie (accelerated heart rate), fever and shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied to patients who react strongly to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be able to check all new information (EMEA) every year, to test and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe Aldurazyme regarding reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for transport from Aldurazyme to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal Cell Cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, derived from the Chinese Hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of Mutilysaccharides I (MPS I, α-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a physician, which has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial Infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is wearing this, all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not established, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any related side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the fusion Day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment, in the revitational equipment for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients of IgG antibodies against laronidase are expected to form usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretical increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of treatment carefully.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with drugs (antihistamines and / or antipyards) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of an easy or indirect positive reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reducing the rate of infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the fusion rate, when the response has occurred, with which the response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen) and / or corticosteroids, as well as a reduction in the fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, which occurred in the previous reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or Procain, because there is a potential risk of an interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data to newborns which were exposed to laronidase on breast milk, is recommended to satisfy during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were mainly filed as infusion-related reactions which were observed in the study of 53% of patients in phase 3 study (duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years of age (duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted pharmacist reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which have been observed during the phase 3 study and their extension for a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently observed in the following table: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some cases with severe MPS-I-conditional participation of upper respiratory symptoms and lungs in the Prehistory, there were also severe reactions, including bronchospasm, respiration status and visual allegation (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted medicines in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported in a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly heavy legume form and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients there was a seroonversion within 3 months after the treatment was performed during the age of 5 with a heavy evaporatory version (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature termination of the study) were found in 13 / 45 patients by Radioimmunophcipation (RIP) Assay demonstrable antibodies, including 3 patients who never came to Seroonist.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing until low-antibodies have been a robust reduction in Gag mirror in the urine, while patients with high antibody titers was a variable reduction in Gag in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed marginal to minor neutralisory effect on the enzymatic laronidas- activity in vitro, which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction in Gag in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undesirable medicines, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG-antibody.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and preventing any other accumulation sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After an intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the lysosomes, most probable above man-6 phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients showed the mean phenotype and only one patient had the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients have been recruited if they had an ongoing expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients with the placebo group to improve lung function and inability to be displayed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group, as emerged from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decline in percentage ratio of FEV is clinically significant and the absolute pulmonosina increased further to the size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatitis, 22% (85%) up to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant waste of Gag mirror in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine) was observed, that remained constant until the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined end score, which was clinically significant changes in the 6-minute walk-test, was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A single-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was investigated in 20 patients at the time of their admission to the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the severe circulation form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage increased because of increased GAG- levels in the urine in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) demonstrated a normal mental development (n = 3) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development rate, while in the elderly patients were limited to limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations about the pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosing schemata were carried out on the Gag mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, an represented alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemata is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate each new information which will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2383">Should patients do not develop hematological toxicity ≥ Grad 3 (except neurotoxicity), the patient must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled when patients are reduced to 2 dose-reducing toxicity or non-hematological toxicity 3 or 4 or so- on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above, in comparison to patients at the age of 65, an increased seveni- ko consists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to not sufficient data for harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials in patients with a cancer-in-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, no dose adjustment is necessary, which are recommended for all patients recommended Dosage adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Data for patients with a cancer-in-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase values from the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (with presence of liver metastases) are not specifically examined in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be observed with regard to the bone marrow and punches must not be given to patients before their absolute Neutrophil has reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cytotals have reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute Neutrophiliation, thrombocyte and maximum non-haired toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 of hematological and nichthatological toxicity such as Neutropenie, febrile Neutropenie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neutropenie was beautoped if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed patients need to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a preventive toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium insufficiency insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non-steroid antiphistika (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, the day of therapy and mind- after 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are intended for therapy with Pemetrexed is necessary to avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-time for at least 5 days prior to therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who competed these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>

<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed occasionally, if this ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, simultaneous use of attenued lifelines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible cranial of reproductive ability consists of Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out prior to treatment - Ginn to get advice regarding the lock servicing.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses can lead non-steroid antiphistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g daily) to a reduced breakdown of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable if patients with normal renal function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mind-, 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data for interaction with NSAIDs in long half-time such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulanants and antineoplasty chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of INR (International normalised Ratio), when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for using Pemetrexed by pregnant women, but like ande- antimetabolites are expected to treat serious birth defects in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary and after careful visibility of the use for the mother and risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2514">Alli may not be applied by children and youngsters under 18 because there are not sufficient data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimally resorously absorbed, is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Oversensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components of simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chronic Lyme neuroabsorption syndrome (see Section 4.6) • Additional treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulancies (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of advancing gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may take if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or oily diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be used with improved metabolic inspection, patients who consult a medicine with alli, before the start of a therapy with alli, consult a doctor or pharmacist if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who occupy alli as well as medicines for hypertension, or an increased Cholesterinspiegel, should consult your doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to prevent additional fluctuating measures to prevent the oral contradiction in the case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on pharmaceuticals to drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin has been observed a reduction of Ciclosin-Plasmasmirgel.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In combination with orlistat or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally standardised ratio ratio) can be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotins remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended before bedtime to take a supplement of the Multivitamin awarded to ensure a sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a unique dose Amiodaron, a limited number of healthy volunteers, which at the same time received orlistat, was observed a minor decrease of Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies reveal no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are combined with the pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg above a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100), not known (frequency on the basis of the available data is invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of the adverse events known after the market launch of Orlistat is unknown, as these events were volunteered by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">+ It is plausible that treatment with alli may lead to anxiety associated with possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects, without any significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">During the majority of the cases reported by orlistat-overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on examinations on humans and animals can be attributed from a fast return of any systemic effects, which are attributed to livesting properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect consists in the lumen of the stomach and the upper thin-intestine by covalent Serin-Rest of the gastric and pankreatic liveen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg orlistat is taken three times daily, the absorption of about 25% of the food oil is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 attains the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypokaloric, fetal-based nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of Randomization), has been rated as follows: as alteration of the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants that have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of its initial weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">With the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting point 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma centration of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 For therapeutic dosages, non-metallized orlistat in plasma was measured only sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µl) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who was administered in a minimal systemic dose, two main metabolic rate, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-form-leucine group), could be identified by approximately 42% of the total plasmasoncentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on security spharmacology, toxicity in repeated treatment, genotoxicity, kanogenous potential and reproduction, the pre-clinical data is no particular danger for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks after treatment, as you may not yet have reduced the fat content in diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize the nourishing related accompanying symptoms: • Begin for a few days, or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fetal-based diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and the size of the servings you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the probability that you will exceed your fat limit. • Give your recommended fat amount evenly on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal, not to take it in the form of a obese main court or a lasting bedmeal. • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur, they learn to control the time through adjusting its diet.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alxi is used in chemotherapy regimens that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting are (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy agents (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetikum).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended to provide the effects in this age group not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Alxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 59% of patients who treated with Aloxi were no vomiting (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy and vomiting agents, 81% of patients who treated with Aloxi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vomiting (153 out of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the transport of Aloxi within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy because of a cancer illness and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy because of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be amplified by adding one of the Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron extend the colon days, patients with anamnesty oripation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored according to injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable from the simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT to interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is prolongs, or which may extend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to other chemotherapy-therapeutics, alxi should not be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited against tumours caused by tumours (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-static concentration of a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokinetic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 inhibitors (dexamodarone, Cimetidin, oxorubicin, fluoxetine, amoxetine, raxorum, napitidine, raxorum, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences about the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies cannot be applied, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms observed (a total of 633 patients) that were at least possibly with alxi in connection, headaches (9%) and fruit ipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the reception (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage exhibits similar skins of unwanted events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effectiveness to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy for a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blinded studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate inant chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg of Dolasetron (half-day 7.3 hours), which was given on Day 1 without the dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study included 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the study with moderate-based chemotherapy and the study with strongly emant chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials of indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron owns the ability to block the ionary and repolarisation involved in the ventricular channels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of administered palonosetron in single doses of 0,25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally observed in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After an intravenous gift from Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured in 11 Hodencarcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured in the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, that with once daily intravenous administration of 0,25 mg Palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days reached overall exposure (AUC0- ∞), which was measured after an exceptional intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher than 0.75 mg upwards.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% eliminates about the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have compared to Palonosetron via less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolic studies have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower dimensions, the CYP1A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unchanging active ingredient made around 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolt, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver function may increase the terminale elimination time and the average systemic exposure of Palonosetron, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate to the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 of these clinical trials have shown evidence that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ionage channels, which can extend to ventricular De- and repolarisation and extend the action time.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of people) which resulted in an increased frequency of liver cancer, endocrine neoplasmen (in thyroid, pituitary, panniermark) and skin tumor in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the used high doses and since alxi is intended for one-time use, the relevance of these results will be low for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The holder of this approval has to inform the European Commission on plans for transport in the framework of this decision approved in the framework of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-long) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">With a microscopic study, liver tissue expires damage, in addition, the values of the Liptine Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) increases the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon put data on the basis of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of the drug, action, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with Hepatitis C the efficacy of Alpheon has been compared with the efficacy of the reference to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, how many patients were given after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after adjustment of treatment to the drug (i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns relating to the stability of the active substance and the drug may not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with Hepatitis C based on the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A were similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjustment of the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retardant with more patients than with the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon also had any side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test used in the study was investigating the question of how the medicine forms an immune response (i.e. body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection) and small infected firmary (Riss- or moutheconds), depreciation and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for treating infections that have been demonstrably or probably caused by methicillinresistent Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months but in patients under 18 years of age, the treated skin surface may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment two or three days, the doctor should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking of bacterial ribbons (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and therefore inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The primary Indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was aborted to the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of the 139 patients under altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients were enrolled in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected bonfires, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at skin-dogs, about 90% of the patients responded to the treatment of both groups.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, that Altargo was found in the treatment of wastewater (inflated cavities in body tissue) or by infections caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an appeal to the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products "(CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were to exceed the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small firmary, depreciation or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. to bring approval from Altargo to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients in which two to three days do not show any improvement, are supposed to be examined again and an alternative therapy is considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a transmitting or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled, the ointment carefully inspires and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical trials in clinical trials were the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients suffering from infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy is intended to be considered as an 2- or 3-day treatment does not enter an improvement or deterioration of the infected area.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other toponic drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma centurations, which have been reached after topical application for topical application or infected-surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibitor in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg of Ketoconazole, the middle retapamulin is increased from 1% retapamulin Salbe on sloped skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure of topical application in patients, dosisadjustment is not required for a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction level of reproduction after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicative and the application of retapamulin is preferable to an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / stopped or terminates the therapy with Altargo, is between the benefit of the nursing and the benefit of Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied Altargo was the most frequently reported side effects of irritation at the administration, which was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effect of retapamulin is a synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance taken by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesize by interaction with a specific binding unit of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial giant of other ribosomal interacts antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding office of ribosomal protein L3 involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-binding office and the Peptide of the Peptide.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through binding at this binding location, Pandromutiline reduces peptidylates, blocking part P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s-bosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms seem to appear, a consultancy should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin next to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a study with healthy adults was raised 1% retapamulin Salbe daily under occlusion on intact and on sloped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days in the topical treatment of secondary-infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the mediation and the children between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans according to topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomen was primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro testing on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test, or in cultures of human peripheral blood cells as well as in rats micro-core test for in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats indications of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which reached a maximum exposure of up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure of humans (topical application at 200 cm2)</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats, with oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development tools (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval has to ensure that a pharmacovigator system is present, as in Module 1.8.1 of the approval application is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the market product will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the transport network is obliged to provide detailed studies and additional pharmacovigation activities as they are described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and are described in the 1.8.2 of the approval application, as well as all additional updates by the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for" Products for Human Use ", the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated place should terminate the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the area that is treated with Altargo if it was not expressly agreed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in your eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is based on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor about advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gazebstrip, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is available in an aluminum tube with a plastic seal, containing 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or contains in an aluminum bag that contains 0,5 g Saline.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two doses of existing vaccines, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is assured that the vaccine will lead to an end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a rhygenic dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing it to the immune system (the natural resistance of the body), as opposed to an illness.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens than "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine vaccination of Twinrix's adults and the vaccine Marrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same illnesses, however, Twinrix adult and Twinrix Children are administered within a three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adult parents contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the use of Twinrix growns. also used as cover for the Ambirix application.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main index for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protective antibody concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix performed at between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection on the development of anti-hepatitis A and B anti-oxidation cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the Ambirix protection was similar to a six-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, applet deficiency, pain at the injection point, redness, matriness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react in patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) to active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic) will not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologises. a permit for the transport of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic immunisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the election, and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a rhyper is desired for Hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B- and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibody are in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovalants vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immunizcompetent individuals who have addressed a request of hepatitis C vaccination, as they may not be protected by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections, for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring can always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is needed, the standarmpfschema is recommended to combine with a combination of combination, the 360 ELISA units formally contains hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and people with malfunctions of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies, so that in these cases other vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to an optimal impetus to an optimal impetus, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, at Thrombozytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can only injure subcutaneous injections, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was born in the second life in the form of a separate injection, with a combined diphination, tetanus, azellular pertuss-, inactivated poliomyelitis and hemophilus type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined masern- mumps vaccine was administered, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosusive therapy or patients with immune defects, possibly no adequate response of immune response is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matologists, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the previous thiomeric and preservative vaccination status.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, in total, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to and 15 years the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and maturing on a calculation basis per vaccine dose of Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle there reported 66,4% of subjects that Ambirix had given profits above pain, compared to 63,8% for subjects that had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matcha was comparable to a height (i.e. across the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects, the Ambirix, compared with 36,2% for subjects that received the 3-doses combined-combinations).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The abundance of pain and maturing was low and comparable to, which was observed after administration of combination-material with the 3-cans vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1 to 11 year-old vaccines the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that with the 3-doses of formed hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, during the 6 to 11-year-old years, the Ambirix was a common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccinations, which reported serious side effects during the 2-doses with Ambirix or during the 3-doses with a combination of 360 ELISA- units of formed hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B - was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out in vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the serum samples of anti-HAV 99,1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month of 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The exchange rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to a month of 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was done at 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two cans of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combined-material with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunity was valuable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3-dose samples.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which was achieved in a clinical trial study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccines period (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-cans vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses with a combination fibre with 360 ELISA units of formed hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies were detected between the ages of 12 and 15 years after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response in this study was comparable to both antigens, which was observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination fibre, consisting of 360 ELISA units formed in inactivated hepatitis B surface anininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- up to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-ageing and anti-HBS antibodies could be comparable 24 months after immunisation in 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix is in the second year of life with a combined diphination, tetanus, azellular pertuss-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccines (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined mascot-mumps vaccine is administered, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical trial carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults was shown for the present formulation similar seroprotein and serum samples as for previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the reset on any other partial particles and / or physical changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a pale face, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not be fully protected against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccines was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are infected with Hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus from the administration of both vaccines and hepatitis B virus (although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel) an vaccination may not prevent one disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms resulting in a hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection can not be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• When your child has an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be caused by itching skin rash, breathless or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have occurred once an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly find a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to usually prescribed by the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of hepatitis C virus (360 ELISA units of a formally inactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a combined hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccination with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child to give an vaccination before the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected in people suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's own resistance, or if you / your child will undergo a haematic catalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons on vaccination may not be sufficient, so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Be of your doctor if you take / take your child additional medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you have vaccinated or immunoglobuline (antibodies) or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and multiple limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Immaclobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix is not administered to pregnant or lactating women, unless they are vaccinated for Hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about specific other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of data, which has become known since the first approval of the index, the CHMP retains the view that the benefit ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix was only placed in a Member State (the Netherlands since May 2003) in traffic, the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with incomplete Enzymdefect or with hyperammonium encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammoniac concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products "(CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonium in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle to high ammoniac values effectively prevents.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonite was approved under "outstanding circumstances" due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated by all patients who have already manifested a complete Enzymmangel (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete Enzymdefect, which manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use when a hyperammonium encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing up to 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamylphosphatsynase or ornithintranybamylase, substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine osuccinatsynase deficiency must be arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as a risk for the formation of oophagusulcera occurs if the tablets are not immediately going to the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and eco-forming clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolic and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is done over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore counterindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous formations of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown in neuronal verification and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether phenylacetate is excreted in the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated throughout the breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an unwanted event (AE) and 78% of those unwanted events have been assumed that they were not related to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactaziazide, heavy hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occured for a 5 month old toddler with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dosislimiting neurotoxicity with an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active connection, which conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Sturchiometrically is seen by phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative vehicle for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with malfunctions of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for every gram, sodium phenylbutyrat may be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always inflicated, and the disease carried itself in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or their sticked-free Analoga in the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitylbutybutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), proteinated Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate by postpartal (however within the first month of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and the survival rate was diagnosed after the first occurrence of hyperammonium encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous bamylase deficiency), which were recovered from a hyperammonium encephalopathy and then treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a proteinated diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are already reversible surgical deficits and in some cases a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is well known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney, whereas phenylacetylglutamine is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat and in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle, the hemogative installer and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites were also examined in cancer patients with an intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking a measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrate were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with cyclic cyclic disorders or hemoglobinopathies, after different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) the next morning after nocturnal fasting do not detectable by phenylacetate in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no adverse effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is used to be orally taken (infants and children who still have no tablets, or patients with swallowing) or over a gastrostomibud or a rhinestones.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing up to 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine, and serumproteins in plasma should be held within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamylphosphatsynase or ornithintranybamylase, substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat recorders were exposed to the birth of phenylacetate (active metaboo by phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid of pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year-old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactaziazide, heavy hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Sturgeon poles seen is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds containing 2 nitric atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative support for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations about the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with malfunctions of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for every gram, sodium phenylbutyrat may be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform 15 minutes after taking a measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrate were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">For this purpose, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the middle measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g of sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to obtain the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver properties are missing, so they accumulate the stickening waste products which accumulate in the body after consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are conducted laboratory studies, you must inform the doctor that you can use AMMONAPS, because Sodium phenylbutyrat can affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding, you are not allowed to take AMMONAPS because the medicine may go over to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases also condivinity, headaches, taste problems, offspring of hearing, disoriety, memory problems and deterioration of existing neurological states were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find one of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you have forgotten AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied to treat patients with "acute Koronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the breast with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- uplift" (an anomal measuring value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who suffice to a PCI, a higher dose is administered, and infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with Angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, with the effect of Angiox in sole gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIA inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with conventional combination therapy with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the infantry to prevent a closure), and they received additionally other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or auditing) after 30 days or a year as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who were subjected to a PCI was Angiox in relation to all indicators as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding within which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox is not used in patients that may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against bivalent in, other miludine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It should not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with powerful blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products "(CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is in the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is an acceptable substitute for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission adopted The Medicines Company UK Ltd has issued a permit for the transport of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute Koronarsyndromes (instabile Angina / Non- ST-Hebdo infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of an emergency attack or when an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is performed in another episode, an additional bolus should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and increases the infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI tests, after clinical requirements, the reduced Infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initials intravenous bolt of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one resulting in subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a certain Bolus-gift of angiox is not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened (ACT by 5 minutes) to under 225 seconds, a second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the bolt daily is rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is not required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), the PCI is handled (whether with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower incidence of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second boldness dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second half dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which was conducted in phase III- PCI study (replace-2), which was conducted for approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes following the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dosing adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and even with dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of unquestioned Heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous formulation of low-molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• unknown hypersensitivity to the substance or other components or other toxic blood pressure due to a disturbance of hemostasis and / or irreversible bacteriasis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bivalent in combination with another anticoagulant is administered (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though with PCI patients under Bivalirudine, most of the arteries of the arterial points occur, can undergo surgery to patients suffering from pervasculosis coronarintervention (PCI), while treatment in principle occur everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taken in warfarin and treated with bivouirudine, should ensure a monitoring of the INR value (International normalised Ratio) in order to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalirudine is reached in front of the treatment existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge on the mechanism of anticoagulanants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocytenants) can be assumed that these compounds increase bleeding risk.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In each case with the combination of bivalirudine and anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostal parameters are regularly monitored in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">In terms of effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the development or postnatal development are inadequate (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either inquencapsulated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitor.</seg>

<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, treatment with bivvalirudine is immediately going to break down and the patient engulously monitor with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombingestor, which binds both on the catalytic centre and also on the Anion bindings region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of bivalent around Thrombin, and thereby its effect, is reversible because Thrombin sander slowly splits the bond of bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudine, with serum of patients, in which it had come to heparininduced thrombozytopenia / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), do not induce thrombocytes aggregate action.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients Bivalirudine shows a dose and concentration of anticoagulatory effect which is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If the patient has been performed a PCI after the patients, an additional bolus of 0,5mg / kg Bivalirudine was given and the infusion increases for the duration of the surgery to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, teenagers and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin for the provision of glucose (sugar) in the blood or can not process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin is very slightly different from Humanity, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter activity duration than a short-term humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body can not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effective, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main index for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glycoliated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.14% for insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be applied in patients who are possibly sensitive to insulin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra needs to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the decontamination or subcutaneous infusion in the area of abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin changes, the insulin requirement can be reduced in patients with restriction of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of action, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin delivery (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may vary a change of insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosing or termination of treatment, particularly in patients with an insulatory diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycemia and a diabetic Ketoazide; these conditions are potential life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin delivery should be performed under stringent supervision and may be necessary to change dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of hypoglycaemia depends on the activity profile of the islanders and can therefore change from changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To enhance the substances that increase blood sugar levels and reinforce the inclination to hypoglycaemics, angioxetin-converting enzyme (ACE) -Hemmer, fluoroxifylline, propoxyphics, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of sympatholytics such as Betablockers, Clonidine, Guanethidin and reserpin, the symptoms of adrengen antibodies are weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">In clinical studies of reproduction, no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humanity showed in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin is not related to breast milk, nor is it absorbing after oral application.</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophie Is failed to continuously change the injection of injections within the injection area, may result in a lift podystrophy at the injection station.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia can be treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriately trained person, or treated by an intravenous gift of glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluing injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the urine cause for severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by blocking the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be faster by insulin-use of insulin delivery faster and the duration of operation is shorter than for hu- manic normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes mli- TUS, insulin-detection of a dose of proportional gluing effect, and with 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of the glucose level effect, just like humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin has twice as fast active effect as normal human metabolism and delivers the full glued impact of about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Data from the data was evident that at an application of isinglulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprandiale glycemic control is reached, as with human normal insulin, which is 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin was processed in 2 minutes before meal, a better postpranal control was given as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is charged 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is given as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 billion grooves before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of meal was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of meal was given (Figure 1A), as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
