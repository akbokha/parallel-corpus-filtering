to use the crash module , click on the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of crash@@ es , if available , delete .
the module ( also called folder filters ) can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current directory of work on different kinds .
to view the DO@@ M tree view inside &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; then select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M page . as default , the display is starting with the root notes of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are elements of this root no@@ des .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text screens to view the contents of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists of sp@@ ind@@ ed folder arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property , that the sum of sizes of sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it . consequently , large files can be recognized even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap parameter is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simplify navigation have the right colour view and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either be either a depth for the slight detection of the stress @-@ depth or the figure of another file extension as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various features of the appropriate file or folder . if it is displayed at all , only if sufficient space is available for the display or if the surface is displayed by restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . moreover , you can specify the relative positions of the label in rect@@ angle .
in case of events for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view ; this frame will not always be followed . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square .
as distribution of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will leave . here it is necessary for the labelling and to avoid space losses through frame always adv@@ an@@ ta@@ geous that rec@@ tan@@ gles can arise , which are square . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second healing .
you can specify the minim@@ ized area for an entry via the menu entry . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ al pattern is drawn in the area of the over@@ arch@@ ed entry , in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an or@@ derly entry .

&amp; digi@@ plug . includes a quick image processing with basic training tools . you can view this to evaluate your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plug@@ ins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; stand@@ ar@@ ed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional abilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ Export and ICC colours .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens , via which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ plug ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ sis ; attempts to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in error report . all required information is already registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ist ; is a project that is supported by a community . therefore , if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ist ; then ask you to answer other users of &amp; digi@@ al ; and hopefully you can answer any other user questions . in this mailing list , you should be spoken in English , but you should be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ plug ; to be experienced .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ plug , is the application in the developer mailing list . guide to report in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ p@@ ist ; .
if you &apos;ve got &amp; digi@@ plug ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply type a local , remote or remote folders . enter the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your machine . this path is stored for all image folders .
later you can add so many folders as you &apos;d like to add . &amp; digi@@ plug . will use additionally as Al@@ ben@@ sis as well .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images you have . &amp; digi@@ plug ; considered every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . during the search of the folder you will see a progress indicator as these :
&amp; digi@@ plug ; for recur@@ sively perform the library path in all its depth . you can &apos;t let down sub@@ folders , unless it was in pet@@ ri@@ fied folder . this you can insert ag@@ ger@@ bs &amp; digi@@ plug as you insert a point in front of the folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as basic folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list have no photos as symbols . you can change it by using any photo from the album , and this will then be used as an album icon . more details can be found in the Alb@@ ums section .
once you have configured the Base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ plug . after that you should learn how to use My Alb@@ ums and My Device box to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the blank mode of your camera , it may also handle tape ; possibly , the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ v library . if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu of Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ support .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ workflow .
an easy to use camera interface will be provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library of photo@@ 2 . of course , every media and every card reader is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras are used by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will then appear as a USB storage device ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which has a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras . G@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ is@@ sions on the serial port are slow . &amp; digi@@ plug . supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the EX@@ IF support is not provided by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not spare any thumb@@ nails or production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things of &amp; digi@@ plug , is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manip@@ ulate pictures in virtually any way as it can also manip@@ ulate how it is also a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ plug ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes did in &amp; digi@@ plug ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the lateral bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
pulling and off images will work everywhere : you can place a picture in another part of the al@@ ben@@ tree , above the horizontal separation line or in a different application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not in keywords , date list or search .
- a file selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter will only be used for the fields indicated in the tool@@ bar . thus , the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind it will be displayed as a symbol view . which fields are displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ot ; presents a organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be saved in a single album , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ ds or after the date , on which the album has been created first , sorted . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .

the Advanced Search provides you an extended search form with many search parameters available with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ . s database .
the list of search rules is used to reset the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ database . any option can be added with others via logical operations all ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... link above . furthermore , you can search the type &amp; quot ; AND N@@ ICH@@ T@@ quot ; Create .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ sis ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows you to compare these Sig@@ nat@@ ures . the smaller the difference between two pic@@ sig@@ nat@@ ures , the more they meet . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a area in which you can drop each image to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ amp , the results can be enlarged or reduced by the icon of the un@@ exact search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can let it fall there .
sketch : draw @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ plug . find the right images . here , a swelling value can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive map testing tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can push it out and move it to the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse kno@@ b to draw a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course your pictures Ge@@ o data is included .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live encoder folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can simply compare images . it works with all supported image formats , also raw files , together .
choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To insert the ligh@@ table from the context menu . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug , you can quickly open the lumin@@ ous table with L Extras .
from the thumb@@ nails you can draw the images you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . when you carry a preview of the tool bar , you will also be able to synchron@@ ize this with the other picture , then they will compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to display quickly out of a picture series . if you use p@@ eg@@ s from the tool bar , then use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right hand . this makes it easy to use through a number of similar images .
of course , the normal del@@ etion work also works directly from the light table as for example F4 File Edit ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it possible to combine visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each report you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ eling function , which you can see on the visible arrows . in order to hold the visible area of the image , you have to click it and the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will be shown to preview the same image range .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the zoom kno@@ b below the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in the image and out into zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word - aside from the process of the process , after the picture has been made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the pictures takes up to the final issue and the permanent storage . most of us does not make this form a form of digital inventory management . but most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips how to use your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we will consider downloading , ren@@ ame , convert , evaluate , evaluate , optimize , optimize , optimize , waiting , and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock administration accepts , categor@@ ized , categor@@ ized , sec@@ ures , trans@@ forms and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value .@@ quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is provided according to your definition , information about or documentation of other data which will be managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your machine , then you don &apos;t need to find out more than 1000 photos . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ plug . . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you don &apos;t want to store very fast searching and a secure arch@@ iving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need and know what to do in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos will have to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; Please note that you need to switch to a larger drive sometime .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you are taking sufficient photos in one year . if you are taking sufficient photos , then you will be able to use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then use a folder for pictures you will print or publish on a web page .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements like e.g. ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , arch@@ iving , working processes , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the metadata option in the setup page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ plug ; this ensures that EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data can be written in the file . if you forget it , then you can select the metadata from the database in the files you can select the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? it presents &amp; digi@@ plug , to give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course these are the most important .
now the real work begins , as you should select every photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s now talk to keywords , keywords , as you are frequently called on other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import Catal@@ og@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then the tree is not going to insert the images in the right place . the change of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by the drag of a sub@@ tree to another . the modified keywords are being updated by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated throughout the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata is over@@ cut . this is a very coar@@ se representation , since each block of metadata is composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are features of all images .
enough the keyword - the next section refers to excer@@ pts or comments , the third important tool for catal@@ og@@ ing your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos simply , you want to share it with your friends , family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer to see some details , people , space .
and now I say to you this of the lan@@ ders of the allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ ot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . wow ! you begin to hear memories , the historical period of time is present again , you might even hear the silence . so you can even change your perception of this panorama .
for others , consider the title itself more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is it the meaning of the viewer you need to understand and understand what you understand .
it is ok if a picture is not perfect , when it has the strength to work only with a lab@@ eling for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can also use a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) and you can even export it to a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in Web galleries , you will have to tell you a second time for your wishes and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images , the train of the spatial presentation is now running at light speed .
the possibilities to explo@@ it ge@@ olo@@ cation during the future are countless and will be able to repeat that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travels through images with geographical data . you can also export K@@ ML files using Google Earth format . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; using the Google map viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for working others .
the following description tells you what information about &amp; digi@@ plug has to be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for author@@ ization and author ) : this field should have your name , or name of the person who has created this photo , for example , if it is not desired to be used the name of the photographer , for example , the name of the photographer has to be used . this field does not have to be changed once more . this field does not support Kom@@ ma nor Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
auto@@ graph@@ er ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples here can be titles , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well .
editors ( syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors ) : use the provider field to identify who the photo offers . this must be not necessarily the author . if the photograph is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , the picture will be shown here , then the group / agency will provide the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they cannot provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator , this is the solution for the majority of your photos . for individuals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important to this protection .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ plug and will provide such a module for stap@@ le processing in the near future .
topics : turn@@ out error , record failure , power bre@@ aches , EC@@ C , transmission error , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , deser@@ ts , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ ition
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you by using traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you can solve problems with the so @-@ called new media .
roll On@@ track , the largest data reproduction company in the world , has some interesting statistics that has caused the reasons for data loss .
to combat the problem in case of CDs / DVDs , you may have to buy them more than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in arch@@ e@@ quality . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your mess@@ aging space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good discount and good recording devices . the best DVD recordings are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you are much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control function mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a affordable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that doesn &apos;t work miracles in CDs and DVDs . but there are also similar applications that are not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data of damaged floppy disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the format of DVD Blu @-@ ray disc and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8,5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
if you are slowly burning with a good recording device on high quality media in one not propri@@ etor@@ ic format . please do not forget to copy the media with a description , date and author license and then in front of a clean , dark dry and before pets protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk @-@ makers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : floppy study
shortly : dis@@ cos keep up the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In the temperature temper@@ ament you can &apos;t find this error . some of SM@@ ART identified error announ@@ cing the directly imp@@ ending failure . these are especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing houses . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also get data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses are normally used without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of power , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . this allows these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es blocked keyboards , complete data loss , hard@@ war@@ e@@ aging , destroyed mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against ra@@ ps is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed and the rest is earth@@ ed . however , it is usually in the form of a plug bar . remember that not every plug bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you look for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects against lighten@@ ment and protects the properly connected devices .
since there is a over@@ voltage of each cable to your machine , you should also ensure that all periph@@ eral devices are connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems , which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can result in the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it may therefore be meaningful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically shut down battery energy . this gives you the opportunity to store your data until the current run . if you have a US@@ V you should be sure that they have the same quality standards like a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare your safety in power disorders at the cost of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you think so good your computer is protected . at the end you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer you can store any quantities of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data over the compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions therefore only occur as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services that are based on photos and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional variant provides you more at your disposal , in the case of Flickr . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited memory , which should only be checked in reality .
data backup is very safe from the point of view of the data backup . transmission errors are automatically included thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies offer a backup and a partial memory .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs determine at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection for it . no one seems to have thought in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is much safer than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transfers , as they generate inter@@ ed@@ ences within the data streams . these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transfer problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates which can handle and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope to see it soon also for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
don &apos;t estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss during the notebook and 46 % for the job systems . with not@@ ebooks already the percentage of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most chis@@ els think . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process is avoided by a sudden break during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if however , a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are removed from fundamental physical limits . it &apos;s meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise levels for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are in direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make sure not anyone else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected in any year of a data loss . so , do not secure your data after a plan and test this back before you do something dangerous like re@@ installation of your operating system , replacing plates or the size of hard drives .
suppose you take your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster beats locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft is dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or house .
therefore , disaster prevention means an not local storage . bring up the stairs up , into the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a more common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : to the complete backup and the last differentiation .
in@@ kre@@ mental backup : backup the files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such backup has been made . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is just off and not progress .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machine . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens and if you want to increase the security via ssh .
backup important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this approach allows you enough time to recover and restore losses . at the same time , you come to backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eve photos and metadata , copying images , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predict@@ able because of your nature , you have to review and re@@ assess what time flies . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system are used backwards . the less variants you have used in the past , the more light it is easier to assess the future .
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or change open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional pressure to change a system in its size . this is actually getting bigger .
let &apos;s go out that you have the scal@@ ability with your plans and the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and re@@ locate it to a new record :
check the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new plate has been detected by the system , but do not hang them up .
&amp; Connect ; dd if = / dev / SD@@ B &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC / S@@ DC # source ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS ; resi@@ dual / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software you can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard , but it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can handle many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IFF needs and a slow compression . this format we would like to store your pictures .
T@@ IFF has been widely used as image format . T@@ IFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ sy comp@@ ress sal@@ mus ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is , however , that this format is adapted to many people . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the T@@ IFF / EP format and is required to use metadata . a hand@@ ful camera controller is now available and we hope to use the Canon and Nikon .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; Exten@@ sible file information is available with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the file for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers draw it from an original size of your photo , mostly in the raw format , because it can sound the metadata separately from the image file . therefore , it can be noticed at the link between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should be considering whether you use D@@ NG as container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible online metadata standards , which support a large range of application purposes and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I will be working on a wide range of architecture and workshops , standard conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the reader or scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine layer you can use external programs . if you return the pictures with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off under circumstances of the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export it into web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug . in the context of adding a photos to an album you will find a description of how you already have photos that you already have on your hard disk , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album base .
to use &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if this is the case , a Fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file assignment will appear for each file , photos , films , music etc .
before you can download the photos on your machine , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the side@@ bars features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single entry or its metadata .
this dialog features file properties and the photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your machine . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
the rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , production re@@ mark , GPS etc of the image . these information is the same as with the Metad@@ ata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ or ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then the selection from all of them . this will download all photos of their camera in a single album in &amp; digi@@ or . we will download all photos of their camera in an album before downloading the photos from your camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos you can only download the desired choice of boxes of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you select the photos , use the button download and then download the chosen ones . download the chosen ones as long as you choose some photos selected .
if your camera supports this , an option can be downloaded here . these pictures have not yet been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ . in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in front window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you want to download or download selected buttons , select a dialog with which you can select the target album , in which the pictures are sorted , displayed as normal folders . please select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all of them once you delete the button delete all . if you only want to delete a few , then you must select it first and then remove delete files .
note that there is no way to restore photos you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check that the photos will be removed successfully in the tr@@ ash@@ can ; if you want to delete it completely . if you want to er@@ ase the camera memory , you should make sure that it is much faster than the camera memory .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not very meaningful name . the file names are usually recycled again after the photos of the camera were loaded , so it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been made to integrate into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dat@@ ors based under@@ wear . if you use this last option , a folder will be created per day .
the options During the transfer opens three further options which are performed before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF data are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another date format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M . switch to the option Date &amp; Time . for further adjust@@ ments you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ pack ; for a photo is used , below the name displayed , the camera will be stored in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to take time in recording , not all cameras are ready for use . in Section side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not supply these information , the photo is mounted in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button labeled and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been made available on the date you can use this photo , can be used to download the picture data . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the picture data . all pictures with the same date will be downloaded to the picture data . in Section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , stores &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to change this option , you need to disable this option and select the date @-@ based under@@ wear at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the button download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you should select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the selection selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the pictures are to be loaded high . select the folder settings dialog for the camera . select the desired folder , and press OK to delete the upload . images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude , which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographer , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane to address an area by automatic intake of GPS data . environment plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can view a browser which indicates the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ file ; users who want to locate the place of the photo , or simply document this aspect , it is well to save position data of a picture .
the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 is supported by many GPS data fields , such as direction , artic@@ ulated and map references . it is at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and lastly via manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few working together with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be saved with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , as this is the only format which is the only format supported by the module to ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page , you can make the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
when you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ ield of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of hairy coordinates , e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ sis ; tries to give you much control of its working processes as possible . in order to access this settings , you have to set up in the Settings menu ; set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
select Action can be set on a set preview or image processing . you will thus specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the stand@@ ar@@ did@@ acy and copyright data . these data will be selected automatically in the respective IP@@ TC data fields , even if the option is synchron@@ ized with data from the camera interface . these data are also written in IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should be the job title of the photographer . this can be a freelance photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the car field , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is a picture agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press ; and if the picture is a picture photo , the group / agency should be the image available here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data to the relevant IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . thus , the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; this metadata is also available in &amp; digi@@ or ; imported or imported without lost .
image label as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you can also add to your photos , with the images embedded in the images . attention : with pictures which have already been inscri@@ bed , they will be over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ ous .
the Settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse po@@ inter will rest in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to fix which file types &amp; digi@@ plug , you can remove the file extensions of this list and remove any of these extensions , which will not have any of these extensions , ignored by &amp; digi@@ plug .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the button updated right of each category .
the settings of the brightness of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page at the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can only get better computing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image field , this indication mode can be switched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the images in higher resolution of lumin@@ ance can be encoded as in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the close explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression settings , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this to a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
using T@@ IFF files , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression utility for T@@ IFF @-@ images . this reduces the size of T@@ IFF @-@ images . it has no influence on image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the adjustment of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can safely save yourself . even if you have the los@@ sy @-@ enabled setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was still not supported , but was in planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it is very quick to manip@@ ulate a tool to manip@@ ulate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are identical to the pixels of sensitive light . if you use this option with minimal loss of details , this option marks a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the image a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 pattern pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the whit@@ eboard used in the camera will be used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white @-@ off is not set . default , it is a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images will get more details into the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your images are being burned down as seen through the in@@ ability of your camera , as they show the sh@@ allow@@ able white in the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing data from the plants .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not so fast sati@@ ated like green and red . &amp; cra@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red shar@@ ehol@@ dings of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how many colour or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you might have to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1 . but this can also later be made into the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug . in order to keep the time for dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should keep conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial data sensor , which have many cameras and is known as a matrix colour pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; and D@@ rap@@ w set you three alternatives at disposal : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ rap@@ w . however , it creates colour business acts on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
if you know the color load of your lenses you can put the red and blue re@@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction correction , as you are performed during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions as these . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information like the colour information of a colour space in the other are thus able to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
behavior , if a picture is opened in image processing , start the image management module with raw files .
color profile folder click here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; examine these folders then during startup .
settings of the ICC Pro@@ files you have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profile settings . everything can be changed when opening the shell file .
the color view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color administ@@ er not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to use the camera organ and model you are using . there are some examples like Canon , which do not have color mapping or g@@ amm@@ ar re@@ structure . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma isn &apos;t corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bits . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are further options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your printer can be restored from one device , as your printer can handle a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . you could manually adjust to the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obviously what color profile is fore@@ seen for them . unfortunately , there is not a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official :
the Canon Profile extension lets you know the style for the purpose : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Ne@@ ut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is a interface that can support &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules support which have been written to work together with each program supporting the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of the available modules . then select the list of the available modules . these modules will then appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview pane .
short commands for tasks specified by modules , can be set in the menu below settings commands .
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be accessed via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust the time between the trans@@ itions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes turn on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right hand there is a button automatic detection that is connected to the computer , and if you want to use it , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode . at the moment , the port settings are supported , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are currently supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field will only be active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera . you must enter the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / ho@@ ist on which you enter your camera .
to use &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer to display and turn on display in the display mode .
try to check if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set c@@ amer@@ o@@ dell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the option dialog dialog for shifting of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ etion of a album .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be used to use and use digi@@ plug ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback . otherwise , you must apply changes to the button changes .
you can also use the viewing screen of &amp; digi@@ plug and when starting . this acceler@@ ates from &amp; stand@@ offs under circumstances .
the setting at the start after new photos are for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ plug to look for the basic folders on new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the starting time of &amp; digi@@ plug . if something was removed from the base file , ask &amp; digi@@ plug , you whether it should delete it from the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ or ; in order to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; you will find further information on this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug . includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and to view and improve your pictures . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the entry and selection of the entry / editing menu .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; therefore , under circumstances , you are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image field .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before adding file Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using from the menu file restore or the button restore the image editing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done at your photo since last saving .
almost any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by changing the editing , res@@ um@@ ing or restore editing from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should und@@ o the keyboard short@@ cut , c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to reverse and c@@ tr@@ l @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the default state or restore button in the tool@@ bar no longer press a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed in between .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made any changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ rad or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ saf@@ ts menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you do not wish to use the tool@@ bar . normally , you can also see the tool@@ bar . if you do not wish to call this in the dialog dialog of &amp; digi@@ plug , you can see this in the settings dialog . see this section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , select the image below and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . all images are printed out of your choice . you only need to select the images from your choice , and select from the menu item export assistant assistance . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
der &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , the important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available , even in image processing . it will be shown if one of the five riders will be clicked :
multiple clicking on the same rider lets the side bar appear or rest@@ art@@ ed back to the edges .
in the label view you can input or insert mo@@ ck with unlimited size . note : the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed , so that you can use the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields to allow you to use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are formed after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after having commented it , use either the button users or simply switch to the next picture , the labels will be stored .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . but you can also read the metadata in the files . this will always be done if you have a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the evaluation section shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be applied in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field written by the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for fil@@ tering out words , the keyword tree and a select box that previously applied in this &amp; digi@@ box ; session attached .
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered keyword . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities when looking for a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief for input keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be stored for quick access .
keyword can also be set by marking the appropriate check box in the tree . all keywords are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if several pictures are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image , if you want a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the lateral bar angle filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their Album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , Key@@ word and search Outlook . if additionally one or more key filters are used in the right hand , only the inter@@ section of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop . suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to comment on . if the keyword is already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and click on the selection . then , a dialog you will ask if you want to set the keyword .
in the top example , the main window displays images on a calendar day . the keyword is selected on no keywords , which have been selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a . they were taken with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards , a keyword will be removed from the right st@@ itch tree to the selection . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes occurs on every start of the program . it can also be switched off other settings .
if you have a rule with and create and find that it would have a or be it , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify a Advanced Search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why didn &apos;t Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr have not been listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly on &amp; digi@@ plug and adapted to concrete implementation .
the reason why you have a color @-@ managed workflow , which may have a predict@@ able devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors print from your camera or scanner and the colours you print or in the web , which correspond to those of your digital dark chamber .
if the subject comes to color administration , then everyone wants to know which buttons it must press for the results which he wants . unfortunately , you will give you sufficient background information about colour management at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make links with deeper information allow you to make your own inform@@ al decisions that you obtain the desired result .
if your image work@@ flows meets all of the criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about color administration .
you are currently working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other picture issues are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB the de facto standard is .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for everyone is doing so easy , then why one should use another color space and thus have to worry about color changes ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB compar@@ ing s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ i area , and colours in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s transparent hand and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to load my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! if you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or do not work , you need to cra@@ cked your monitor because s@@ RGB using s@@ RGB , so you have to use your monitor on s@@ RGB using s@@ RGB , then you have to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool has five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve one image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try to check a further manual processing .
the features norm@@ alize , isolated , automation and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic Cor@@ rection Record automatically from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which best works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lamp@@ stands values about the entire picture , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its colour sh@@ ady . this function is often a mag@@ ist@@ ical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
ab@@ same : this method adjust@@ s the brightness of the colors of the selected picture , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity of light is as flat as possible . sometimes it also produces very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that either caused miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic ab@@ used : this method maxim@@ izes the color area inside the red , green and blue canal . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ o@@ gram@@ m@@ ical area .
contra@@ sting : this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ p@@ sis ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white off of a photos .
the white @-@ like correction is slightly restricted since using a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . in case you can carry out too far from the original image , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ like sal@@ mus which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can launch it via menu input colors white off the image processing .
the window window can be adjusted in size . on the left , you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target range . once again you want to see the original screen , then it is enough to click the image window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of pixel among this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamic is altered as soon as you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ate values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow Adjust@@ ment lets you improve or down the shadow of your photos .
to insert the pin with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pip@@ ette to use this button and then click anywhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white equivalent . in this way , the temperature and green values will also be set automatically .
you can also set the white off on the list of prefer@@ ences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure visual k@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . this will show the combined result in the white template . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons as and loading make exactly this . each setting of the whit@@ eness that you have set can be stored in a text file and later re@@ load them again .
the button settings will return all the filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white @-@ like . note that even neutral settings will be able to create another photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will change .
you can set the code entry per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality pictures , but this encoding is also needed for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color pro@@ fil@@ s . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ fil@@ s . a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used for using color profiles .
another important tool is to be found in the menu under color ton@@ ing correction and allows you to save multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can make use of your camera or your scanner at the same error and therefore you will always need the same correction . in the manual for the calibration correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to remove that you can find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
this &amp; digi@@ plug tool has four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Eff@@ ect and a cant@@ ons filter available .
in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was created when one described a partially developed print of a short flash@@ light . this result was a partial neg@@ ativ of the image . this tool was a partial neg@@ ativ of the image . this tool allows you to adjust these interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity the image shows what chem@@ ically is possible . an additional increase will eventually produce a negative image that is not created on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to em@@ bell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimised color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition by &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth photo structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors , but also some phot@@ ograph@@ s , especially those who have hardly immersed in landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light to contra@@ sting edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the slide repeat the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images , the filter can relie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color con@@ current and the brightness of your photo . you can also experiment with the various colour @-@ effects of your photo with the tools in the menu . once you &apos;re satisfied with the result you can use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you get a photo of bad lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce your satur@@ ation instead . all changes you can perform in preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple cand@@ le@@ ur / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool tonic for the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog becomes very complicated to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool looks very complicated , you need the three sliding parts below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active edge or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ der can be clicked on , and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn operation is to shift the regulator and take care of how the picture changes .
on the right side you can see the original and preview of the picture . viewing is dynamic , using the settings of the picture , the following options are available on the left .
sc@@ aling : with this sel@@ box can be set , if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis is shown . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark notes , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , frequently gam@@ ma@@ zes .
the three color pin@@ boards can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the values of shadows , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two regulator that can be used to change the output value as in the input value . for example , the compression of the output value can be used as a background to create something else in the background .
automatically : with this button , image values will automatically set automatically depending on the image values of the image .
save as and Download : using these buttons , the used values in the file system can be saved and later loaded again . it will use Gimp levels format .
if you use this mode and the three color pip@@ ings , you will be re @-@ adjusted for all shadows , medium and solar notes . enable the colour pip@@ ette that you want to use and click on a preview of the original image for rot@@ ational , green , blue and light channels .
the option over@@ load indi@@ scri@@ be controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect just in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the surgery applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output value is unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image is shown . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically in dependence of your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows you to specify the channel which is changed from the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring large areas of a constant color , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a cur@@ sor to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with dar@@ ker exp@@ anders and the associated pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this mark on the corner which represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and Download : with these buttons you can make exactly this . every turn that you generated can be saved in fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gimp Course format .
if you create this method and the three color pip@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points in the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun@@ shades . enable the paint pip@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all colour channels to view over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the effect displayed only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and sun tones was placed with the color pip@@ ette and applied to curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and adjusted ( 2 ) .
der &amp; digi@@ plug channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels , or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the shades of the pictures . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of the channels you can correct the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be regarded as comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the respective color value .
the control for the module are right below : kno@@ b for red , green and construction allow you to activate these channels . this is particularly convenient if you are also able to reduce the corresponding color component , because the channel mixer is designed to generate excellent black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the color channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color does not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose sound pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the color space first .
save and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer @-@ setup allows you to save and then load them . the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format .
the option over@@ load indi@@ scri@@ be controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect just in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re@@ adjusted . option L@@ umin@@ anz will be activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the painted picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography always was fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step , since colour images can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lenti@@ l filter . this looks great , with all scen@@ eries and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so much like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange Publ@@ isher : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with an orange linear filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so much like the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ fel@@ ter .
Rot@@ Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sides effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar fabrics for the day time . so much like the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ iat@@ ric : produces warm light and medium sound while he adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ att@@ un@@ es . this is very similar to the process of getting a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ iat@@ ric oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug and tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
adding texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a screen , the l@@ urch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged spots or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or tri@@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
to keep the eye of an ob@@ server in the limits of a picture is no easy task . it is possible to keep his attention to the image . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ ak eye . under picture frame the module can be started using image processing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . through the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , it surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a bone fe@@ ather and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original target image , but the original aspect ratio will be larger than the original aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool for aspect ratio earlier .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple format@@ ted text in a picture at any spot . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with your features . the larger the image , the greater the character set . by the end you can simply select a frame to the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . the picture is finished .
each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed by clicking on the button OK . after the image has been saved once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug and tool template , you can put a template on a template .
the menu image templates apply in image processing can be used to lay templates about a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . if you want to add the P@@ NG file format and if you want to add a template of the template &apos;s size , please send us an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mail list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
when you use this tool for the first time , you have to set up your template folder with the button Base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you select the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for templates , the folder structure of the template folder appears . the selection of a folder updates the pre@@ viewing panel of templates automatically .
under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the underlying picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller size : this button shr@@ inks the box below . if you want to use the mouse on the image . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , please check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to shift the image below the template . take the image and put it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your photo . the image is then adapted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug has three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny .
sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
it is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus and most digital images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is the result of the digit@@ alization process to summar@@ ize with just minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed if color pixels are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally need more im@@ min@@ ent shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG pictures often have been used in internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format on the other hand should always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanners do not apply a sharp@@ ly filter during the reading of the picture . if you de@@ activate this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by using a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing counter . you can call Cor@@ rig@@ ate sharp@@ ness using the menu entry .
but in this case you should work carefully , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can focus on the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a bit soft , use the tool to command with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate sof@@ ar and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help process the image . the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask to be strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will produce in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius does like many pixels on each side of a channel caused by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ k pictures best in their final resolution .
the sum provides the percentage between the original and the printed picture , which is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount . you can define a minimum difference for a can@@ oe of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded , and therefore beauty defects in faces , sky and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sponge value = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Re@@ focus re@@ foc@@ ussed on image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the protected de@@ f@@ alt@@ ation filter -@@ Algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to burn a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ us@@ er@@ quot ; in which it is better to sharp@@ ens the photo . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . it is mostly used to use better results than un@@ sharp . you can start from the menu by using colors and focus on image editing .
in practice , the circular sla@@ b works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung also has a very long tail , which is far influenced by the original tor@@ ch . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung will even be very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . that causes undes@@ irable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular F@@ altung . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp , but then on Hei@@ ligen@@ sch@@ ema .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
rou@@ gh@@ ts@@ filter : an increase in the pre@@ h@@ filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very badly . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is added to the image even further .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ sel@@ ess Gau@@ ß is caused . in most cases , you should probably use this value to 0 to increase annoying arti@@ facts , so you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the boot@@ loader .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ ry size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . however , you can select good results especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters which you have set will be stored for later and then may be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , paint@@ - and intensity car@@ c@@ tures on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much sur@@ ger@@ ies changes are not immediately visible , but it will leave un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts .
if you are reading and comp@@ ress pictures , eg . JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture .
generally , un@@ sharp masks produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp masks used a bigger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ spicy mas@@ king always have to produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it may never indicate that it is the optimal lens filter . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better for editing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attri@@ but@@ able to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods of focus on a digital picture , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the kno@@ b plain uses the sharp@@ ness of the area which was bl@@ acked out to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour tin@@ te allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here .
the image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ required arti@@ facts with an un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes various prefer@@ ences as a starting point to simplify the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed post@@ ure &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth smooth curve above the image . if a value of 0.@@ 9 should be provided for greater homogen@@ ous regions . a value of 0.@@ 9 should not be provided . please note that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
directional depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is smooth evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . in case you have a high value of wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts will be best removed at a value nearby 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , adjust this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is difficult to value the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is passing through . usually 1 or 2 is enough .
angle length da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small selected , it should also be selected too small for a long time . you should be able to select this value as much as possible and for your needs .
integral step &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel @-@ smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get by selecting this option is low . but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it .
buttons as and loading make exactly this . correct setting of image errors may be saved in a text file and later loaded again .
image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and a high CPU load . so you can download the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below you can see how image bugs with little arti@@ facts will be corrected . the module is shown in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image appears under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter tail@@ or .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the screen picture above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain noise which can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can stay in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can be sm@@ ooth@@ ed by the radius and the colour in it is smoo@@ ther and thus minor mistakes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the edge of the filter . if it is increased the pixel pitch , if it is increased , you may need to change the edges of the filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can not get more and rocket or dirt starts again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response can be removed or h@@ ash tips can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these att@@ itudes do not influence the smoo@@ thing process of the details -@@ settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these att@@ itudes do not influence the smoo@@ thing process of the details -@@ settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more strongly rou@@ gh@@ ing , but it also toler@@ ates the shadow zones .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is too high , the noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can appear on the edges . it can remove r@@ ushing points and is the recommended method for this .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction could change your lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and adjusted with ( 2 ) the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes , a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw a little soft when doing so much easier than a painting with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate sof@@ ar and experiment with the plain . the preview window on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog shows the Eff@@ ect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ pack features ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ acts .
this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s sound , film gran@@ ting , scrat@@ ches , comp@@ art@@ ments and local mistakes that makes it possible along the image con@@ tours and thereby gets the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the texture is performed with another tool , the image error correction , was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ ich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ e@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact quot ; - small standards which are shown in un@@ compressed picture . this setting is meant to correct these problems .
buttons as and loading make exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and a high CPU load . you can therefore download the calculation at any time with the button closure .
below you can reduce how to reduce a photo with anti @-@ shaped rocket . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . you can see the not@@ orious movie ( 1 ) and the corrected paper ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures was reduced to an old colour picture , which was used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that can be seen from the scanner lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image below ( 1 ) can be seen and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
der &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Hot@@ pixel allows it to remove Hot@@ pixel by photos that have a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially popular with high quality raw screen photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; at the moment there is no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the Dark Screen . the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the right dark picture to the corrected image . note that the wiz@@ ard re@@ members the last dark picture and will automatically download it in the next meeting .
the image range and preview can help you correct the result within the image . the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are emphas@@ ized in all areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : it is determined by an average of the neighbouring pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation it is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all the pixels with a gap of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a batch of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in blo@@ c .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color picture , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
der &amp; digi@@ p@@ sis ; Vig@@ ad@@ mitt@@ ance correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ ad@@ ation , i.e. subject corners , one image .
wide angle lens , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not light up the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ ni@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ Ob@@ jective under conditions also show this behavior .
but it has also dis@@ advantages . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also use the center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or less , otherwise un@@ bl@@ ur@@ able effects are created by movement .
with the great exposure of digital cameras and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter by using an equivalent transformation for an image that is applied without this filter . the algorithm is protected by a C@@ enter@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three Reg@@ ulators , you can control the Vig@@ ad@@ ite correction filter and with three further re@@ exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light power atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of the biggest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is compens@@ ated by a optical filter with an aper@@ ture level of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate the density around a larger degree of Vig@@ ad@@ ation .
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ ad@@ fl@@ ation correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the kno@@ b will only provide positive values when you need to raise the settings .
if you want to adjust a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , adjust the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the layer of the &amp; digi@@ p@@ sis ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ ad@@ mitt@@ ing correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the corrected image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lamp@@ shade and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug included ; Lin@@ den@@ dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colour dist@@ or@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ ric resolution of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex form of the picture .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , fl@@ att@@ ens on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ rical adjustment can be eliminated almost .
general : this value controls the thickness of dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped dist@@ or@@ tions can be corrected and positive values wedge @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the dist@@ ortion fourth count . this value is stronger to change than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter the reverse sign of the parameter general .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and resulting in the correction of the first degree . negative values are larger and larger in positive the image size .
bri@@ ghter : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the dist@@ ortion correction . values that you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as default values .
the tonn@@ age or wedge @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes . best result in this correction as all first . if you have a picture new and then carry a bit shaped correction , the effect is apparent of the wrong .
to help you find the best correction to be found , this tool shows you a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to a crucial place such as the se@@ ab@@ ed or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can correct the ton@@ ne / c@@ apped dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
if you have a rag@@ m dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ing cutting from the image processing or via the Zoom kno@@ b of this dialog .
for most pictures the tons @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives like footage from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you have the camera with your hand you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the relative correction for a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared video from the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org site which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with your mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters and sim@@ ulate film screen@@ ings ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the grains of a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ b changes the quantity of fil@@ ming and domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows will be white like snow !
since the filter channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos since the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the inf@@ ra fil@@ mic label applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image has been set under ( 1 ) and the revised picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO Val@@ ues produce a type A@@ ura in the sh@@ orts .
der &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film production is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film grains on your pictures . this is of classic high @-@ speed movies , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , to increase the sensitivity of the films to enhance the producer of the photo emul@@ sion of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ effectiveness effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image will get rid of everyday life . in case you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photograph , gra@@ y@@ ish sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains , although often higher values are needed , even if you need more grains , then you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film proof effect applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used movie sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
der &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
der &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like oil paintings . natural pictures and sty@@ list@@ ic life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ b to influence this effect . the upper elec@@ ts the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better suited for large images . smooth brush or , from the other hand looks , the hin@@ der@@ eness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the screen is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
der &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients in order to create a k@@ ohl@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . therefore , the lines that change the outline in drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you would have chosen to outline which scene you would have chosen for you . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two kno@@ b with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( sm@@ ooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal recording filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value .
der &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving : your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
der &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
depth allows the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % is the default settings .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
using this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by dist@@ ortion effects . it uses the protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divide the image in cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 , the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button closure .
using this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of sharp@@ ness effects . it uses the protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom in sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ther the picture along the shaped lines run by a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ ale : sharp@@ ness the image by rotating pixels around a centre . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : wi@@ rel@@ essly to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lenses . the object seems to step back in the background .
motion acu@@ ity : wi@@ ther the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or a move , camera .
plastic@@ izing im@@ acu@@ ity : wi@@ ped the picture soft@@ ly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dream and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle bulb .
cont@@ actors : bl@@ ends the image by acci@@ dental displac@@ ement of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of an arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ pen@@ fe : finds the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the picture and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then create it with average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore download this calculation at any time with the button closure .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a shel@@ tered volume by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorithm .
dro@@ pping size allows to change the size of the drop . as the drop@@ let size is not automatically generated with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . count changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can keep using &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing can keep a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that will remain free . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es the area will remain free from ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of ra@@ ind@@ rops fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a peaceful sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or rotating into the right orientation . the tools you find in the menu transform@@ ers turning / sh@@ utter mirrors .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you zoom in a picture ? how can you re @-@ invent a picture ? how can you re @-@ invent the missing information ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information here ? how can you re@@ invent the missing information here ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transition size change in menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is shown below .
using the tool to size , use a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to shr@@ ink the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool to infl@@ ating .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation for the increase of an image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the Rider New Size and are listed below :
please maintain the aspect ratio when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained by entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is difficult to value the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
buttons as and loading are used exactly . each insert for photo may be stored as a text file and later loaded again .
photo infl@@ atable is very quick to do with what it does , but it can take very long and a high CPU load . you can download the calculation at any time with the button fast@@ ening .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating that a small color image was enlarged to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the larger image is the result of the linear output enhancement compared to comparison .
the cutting of a photos is not only a common operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to make a picture . the image processing makes it very easy . to make a photo you need to view a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and asc@@ end the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the button again the field of the photos will be cut off . by this way you can change a good overview as your photo after cutting . a new rect@@ angle can create it by simply changing the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button labeled Edit button@@ ing button in the tool@@ bar and the photo becomes cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save files under the menu to save the newly added photo .
in the scope of view , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle , shift the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains .
in the tool Fol@@ ding to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high format or landscape format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format is assigned to the width .
the tool After aspect ratio is used an relative aspect ratio . this means it &apos;s always the same whether you are able to use it inches , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to select the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
down in the dialog box can be set with the Max . ratio button the area for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation , set .
the tool can cut according to aspect ratio and displays its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . when you use the tool@@ ing tool the EX@@ IF data are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the original image and not the original image .
the settings of the coll@@ isions enable help to hide in , so that you can put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like third el@@ re@@ es , harmonious triangles are possible to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the fl@@ aming leaves of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the Ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used for the ancient Egyptians and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number is equal to 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows is considered visually harmon@@ ic .
the golden centre provides smoo@@ ther relief lines if you put together a picture . these help are listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angle . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . that can be a line or different objects . this one can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfill its purpose .
the Golden triangles are also derived from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , gold triangles are no equivalent triangles . diagonal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic .
when you use golden triangles to break your frame , create a effect of the professional phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting spots and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach anywhere else .
the options horizontal and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adapt the color of the lines to your current picture .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture by any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are rot@@ ated around a angle . you can fix it with the &amp; digi@@ or ; image processing and the tool free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide is specified in degrees . with the button settings you can set the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right side .
for your help , the module features free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line at your disposal . after setting it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a print to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is the function transform@@ ing cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option allows you to do a little bit after rotating . note , however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spective transform@@ ations are performed to a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be new automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces that are caused by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty spaces that are caused by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angles below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for individual adjustment is small but two custom@@ iz@@ ations create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to clean this is the image with transform@@ ing cutting out of the image processing .
the sound tool is used to shift part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module over transformation sciss@@ ors .
sciss@@ ors form your image by using horizontal angles and vertical angles . if you press prefer@@ ences , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the Eff@@ ect will display you and the new dimensions of the target range will be shown on the right of the display .
to your help will create a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the control tool to adjust your image .
after having done the shift , the image is wi@@ thered . for a single shift , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings create twice as much p@@ ud@@ ding and therefore you should avoid this .
after shifting the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is the image with transition cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write in some cases from your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ ili@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . but they will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; displays only files in formats . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is shown on the list , this list of file extensions can be implemented and accepted . in the configuration section you will find further information .
virtually all digital cameras do photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format used . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found on Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug . supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression driving on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save los@@ s@@ less , if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures into JPEG or T@@ IFF with the Roh@@ kon@@ verter of &amp; digi@@ . in the configuration you will find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; stand@@ ar@@ dy ; all support cameras can be shown below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ plug ;
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in the avi@@ d or MPEG format . if you are not able to display or edit video files ; but when you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start playing the program .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you go back before .

K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can carry out the first four alignment with the module White .
many tools that you need for the image processing are in &amp; digi@@ plug ; included . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , switch mark , in@@ tox@@ ication , focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; use a uniform dialogue that displays the effect in a preview before the filter appears on the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture app@@ ell@@ quot ; in this dialog box :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the thumb@@ nail . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected range .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the top section shows the original and the lower part shows the filter in the range below the selected range .
split vertically . the left area shows the original and the right to the effect of the filter .
spl@@ its horizont@@ ally . the upper area shows the original and the bottom to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ Mouse about &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nail and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show excess and under@@ taking . the used colors can be adapted in the general imagination .
( 3 ) : the frame to select Pre@@ view . you can drag this frame with your mouse over the image and on the part of the image you want to see . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all entries from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page features features the essential information on the selected image and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map testing tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can push it out and move it to the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse kno@@ b to draw a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course your pictures Ge@@ o data is included .

&amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graphic programs . graph@@ s are used in science , particularly in science , particularly in the computer , particularly in the computer ; so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI . programs , which are &amp; graphic ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; - programs with only few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph interface ; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; displays Graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; - program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change of graphic in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s newly calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph into &amp; Kate ; open the graphic in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; open in a &amp; Kate ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than those no@@ des )
other required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; - program , which requires &amp; graph@@ ic@@ z ; - tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph@@ s . requires in detail :
the main window shows the open graph , each in an own window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; without a argument , the tool@@ bars only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list last open files . click on the first icon to view the Open file .
after you select one or more &amp; dot ; - files selected , the main window looks like at the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just been changed in &amp; k@@ graphic ; charged file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , so you may change your decision as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up your decision to change the Settings ; Settings ... see also .
if you open a graph out outside of a current &amp; k@@ graph ; -@@ instance ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic card ; instance , or want to display the loading graph@@ s in a window of the already current instance .
as with the last option you can permanently save your choice , but also change the setup dialog .
at program startup , you can open all the graphics of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely elected .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts are stored on one page , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you are keeping the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the page again gives you the opportunity to specify the behaviour when a file was changed on the hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically upload or download the changes ) or download the program every time .
the page opening is the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph ; if a graph is opened outside of a current session , you can open a default behavior for this case ( or in a window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the seat administration site provides the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or specify when you start .
the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , offers further possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graphic ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for pointed graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm lays down the edges into the same direction ( from top to right ) and tries to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for odd graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spring @-@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm uses the same as equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for odd graph@@ s a spring@@ board model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ cri@@ b for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image of a picture . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alise images of geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo will be used to locate it . height , long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want cor@@ relate in the main window and call up the menu . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you have to load a track file with GP@@ X file , of course , which have been recorded at the same time at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ dates are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera has to be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone here .
the adjustment for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera address . the devi@@ ation between them will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality you can place a locomotive in a wide time difference between camera and GPS , you can set this limits here and then press the button cor@@ related .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog box comes to the next place you only have to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map by and after you are found . please choose the relevant region and increase it again until you have reached a sub@@ mitt@@ ent accuracy . the card must always be selected manually . the map can be changed from map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exact tool is used to provide a stack of images using GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set will be encoded with UTF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the tab can be matched . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML . you can quickly select a large number of albums . in this area you can quickly see a large number of albums . in the area below is the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text will appear in the head of the HTML page .
the Rider App@@ ear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is clearly explained by itself . if you then click on a picture a new page will be displayed in the picture . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed .
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder that contains all of you . a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures .
with Other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . this also influences the file size . all other settings are explained by themselves .
the Rider thumb@@ nails allow you some of the settings from the Album Rider for the thumb@@ nails , that are small pictures to be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . push down the process to break down the process .
if the module produces the pages the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program uses to determine if errors during generation occurred . the web browser will be launched automatically at the end to show the preview of the gallery . press Close to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and perform base operations like rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or shifts . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG free module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality .
this module allows to store images listed below , to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is rising , because no compression of the colour information is taking place . this can be found again in P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera cable is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor is currently no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I Team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy the data from one image to another . then select the image selection dialog with which you want to copy the image file , so the image to which you want to copy the password . copy the data to the button OK after that you want to copy the file .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Encoder has a tool to convert a set of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ cel@@ erer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG @-@ Video , with a defined length , to convert the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic training computer between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background colour for the Di@@ ash@@ au . with this module , it is possible to create a DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD file for your DVD player . you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
you first have to packed the images that are packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can create the module via Extras MPEG @-@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . if you are planning to adjust the video format from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture . a low value produces very sudden , high contrast , very smooth figure .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should be able to set them black . in doubt you can specify the name and path of the created file in the name of the MPEG output file . if possible , keep the gro@@ unding mp@@ g if possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go back or enjoy a coffee in the speed of your computer , and enjoy the h@@ ash@@ au if you are back .
if a note appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages above the button settings on the right below .
the printer wiz@@ ard allows you to print several pictures on one sheet paper . the combined images can also be updated automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is currently useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / convert images stored in one of three formats in JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM formats .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original works of Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera controller . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first , select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w video Converter window appears then in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the change process . the first option decides , whether the camera settings are to be used for the whit@@ eboard used . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file formats .
the tagged Image format , T@@ IFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you have to edit your pictures frequently or continue to use in JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations not permitted before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you are JPEG as a memory format , the metadata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings with the button button you can start converting . if you want to break this process back , then you can break it off .
the pile @-@ processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , for example by testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the file automatically . this is helpful if it &apos;s done in a previous attempt . however , the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the convert convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the est@@ amps used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can shr@@ ink or enlarge the image from the image size :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt to your image to the screen format .
not proportional : the propor@@ tion@@ ate size change into two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing preparation : prepare the image for photo pressure . the user can adjust the resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background colour , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images in advance . more pictures can go on the list of images added .
after you have started the module , the pictures show window with the images you have chosen , you can add more images via the button . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and add it to the images that you have to add .
with the button pictures remove the selected pictures from the list of selected pictures .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message to your E @-@ mail client with the button OK . you &apos;ll need to add the addresses and the subject here . the images selected by you are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
please take care of sending many images at a time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it is possible to send some emails when you want to send many images .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used each time again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file the comments are attached to the images into a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images File Format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best to use P@@ NG , if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
when you select JPEG pictures of file format , and the original files in JPEG format will be added to the original image files .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically shut down , so you can view the status message . your e @-@ mail program will however automatically start at the end . by button closing , you can switch to this window . EN .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions such as you want your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here .
the option Open@@ GL trans@@ itions in the presentation use very elegant picture trans@@ itions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slides will be very slow .
the file names indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation .
the Loop Loop provides for this the presentation in a final loop . you can then remove it manually with Es@@ c ;
the option to select randomly so the images are displayed in random order . thus , the order of images in the album is not used .
under the delay between the pictures , the distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen trans@@ itional effect . you should thus be out before you show the presentation of your friends !
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . randomly sel@@ ects from any transition between the images a different effect .
during the slide you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can start the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide .
at the left edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the full number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . in case you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets up the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have received your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse &amp; photo album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , then in people , places and in group key words are available .
in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have typ@@ ed your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumb@@ nails . in the following it is described each for itself .
when you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are shown . by this method of selection , you can restri@@ ct the number of images added to a few thousand pictures on a couple of pictures .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view images to view images of your area .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can store with &amp; photo@@ album ; however , for each person you have an own thumb@@ nails , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined . see also the picture .
to view images beside the name , select the button labeled on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . note that you can view the view for each category . note that you can view the view for each category . ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
you must , however , have to set what picture can be displayed for each individual person . now you can select the image editor window , as shown in the picture menu , as shown in the picture menu , you can adjust the image for the corresponding person . in the An@@ gle window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and therefore select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you visit the entry page in the main window , you will see a dialog box which is very similar to the image for fixed the image properties . this dialog can be seen once again on the picture .

with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like reading hand@@ books , but rather want to try hand@@ books , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick access , screen photos and introduction videos .
start &amp; grab a photo album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time start , or choose the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; please download some example pictures and you can download the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a co@@ her@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . a picture of this strip can be seen here : as the name suggests , this strip shows you date statistics about images in your database .
the timetable can display several different time units . each bar shows a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the most only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be active in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date you will always display the first picture of this date in preview Editor ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the time shown in the preview view .

&amp; Photo Album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book it is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built @-@ in version , which you can view over the menu file HTML ...
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . each area will be described in detail .
first , you indicate the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; HTML Ex@@ ample pages see an example of this settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; photo album ; -@@ Export file should be created on the review page . close information on export files you will find in .
lastly , you can select what information is displayed on the HTML page . for example , you can see that information is apparent without the viewer . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewer .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this will not be made specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this makes those who have to view your website and have a monitor that have the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images which have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer you have set the resolution at any time you have set the resolution at any time . it can browse your pictures with low resolution , as well as if he &apos;s getting a picture bigger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the various folders and URL where your site is stored .
best , select a basic folder for all of your HTML files , and for each subsequent set of a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the root folder , where all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and once again will be added to all future pictures . this folder can be selected for all future pictures . here you can either select a folder or a supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if you &apos;re actually created all for the viewer you have a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL you should have here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files are not yet stored in the final target folder , you need to manually copy it . thus , you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the options described above have all three basic folders and URLs related . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you will set in output folders .
if you &apos;re on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can , of course , you may have a lot of time for viewing the pictures , people on the pictures , recording , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even once again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . image properties will be imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file only a link to the file . the advantage of all images in the file is stored , and the obvious down@@ side is the file size . the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im -@@ file directly from the menu file export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , it will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two times . first , the images that are displayed in the file of .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are displayed in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file , it is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML Export .
in the following , the dialog for Export images are described , which you can invo@@ ke the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three selection options available :
to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed to JPEG , and the XML file itself is usually very small , it &apos;s usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the file export file .
the last option of this page reads a maximum image size . if you don &apos;t want to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be quite large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the export database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folders to import images .
it can be that you are called for the category persons of the imported file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called in your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialog box , which should match the categories of the imported file and which categories will match in your database .
in the fourth step you can see the categories of the resulting file associated with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image .
it must be easy to browse images and view images : if you look at pictures you often want to watch images of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this guide you will find out the various steps from ( 1 ) Put the information on your images , through ( 2 ) to check out and pass through ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ations .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your images . but it was expanded and today also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , the pictures are talking about images , but frequently this also includes videos .
&amp; Photo Album ; stores all of his information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most file of their images . it is a simple XML file , which you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , to back up a floppy or re@@ visions in the CVS , where you want .
&amp; photo album ; remember the folder where your pictures are stored and used it for future Star@@ ts . if you want to insert another folder with pictures , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can download &amp; photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
to create a photo album from the menu entry in photo@@ album ; set up in a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user book you will discuss the various settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call settings the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed assistance is available , which you can call through a button transfer to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it has been described as you can specify several features for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
click on the dialog box , which is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete list groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of one medi@@ ator as in .
in view the settings you are available for setting up the member groups , select the category you can configure . in the left window , you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . please find information on the K@@ ip@@ i homepage .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules are used together with several applications together , it can be used to test the modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; so you should use new modules first with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , which can be some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums . even if &amp; photo album ; this kind of order is not supported , it sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so you can use the &amp; photo@@ album .
be sim@@ ulated &amp; photo album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view , so all images that look at the picture show at the moment .
next to the latest album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be used by the category to set you in the dialog box as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you would like to use the category people , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you would have chosen people to view and give it to the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select module modules which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; starting with your own images .
as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu bar at the top . in the tool bar , you will see the window that you still have no information about your pictures . in this section , we will find no information about your images . now , click on the image to show you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to view each image with notes on the picture , where the image has been taken in etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images shown at the same time . if you are depicted on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box by which you can specify people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again if you will always enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the shifting of the images within the list : if you are shown for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures shown the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the names used up are moved up , the people are coming quickly and assigned .
if you prefer to get a alphabetical list of list , click on the icon button for sorting after the list .
if you have selected not@@ ices for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and add these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right side .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a re@@ mark .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all over the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that displays the USA as a sub@@ group . to show you that it is a sub@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of note talk , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or Sub@@ category . in addition , you can also make an entry into a category of this entry . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories in alphabetical order .
you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking the rim of the boxes , click and move the upper edge of the frame , click and move it . you can also move from a frame also by drawing it outside the window range .
when you have adapted the window of the window to your needs you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also finish a frame even completely . if you want to re@@ sign this window later , use the button Options ... and here then window a / out . this procedure can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or any pictures if you do not have a filter . an example here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simple to bottom pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure it .
if you drop a picture on your desktop background , this image is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete or delete your selection menu or select Edit menu . now you &apos;ll see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; B photo album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; photo@@ album ; namely , you can also use the pictures anywhere , so &amp; photo album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures from the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , is not stored on the hard disk . this is , for example , on the pictures 1 @-@ 9 , however , the preview pictures are present , so &amp; photo@@ album ; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see this feature that you need files from folders and copy them again . if you would like to avoid the recording of your pictures until now , please purchase a bigger disk to store all images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay in a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that you can see for others and you can also see all the images that you can see your little Sister , ch@@ iming and select the menu entry All except above .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the F@@ all . if you want to lock the laptop in your little Sister , so select all the images you have locked , shut down . if you want to get the pictures back , click lock up .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be submitted to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change your password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is not very secure . you can read or delete all the pictures on the hard drive and to the others , the password as un@@ encrypted text can only be able to read or delete the password . this kind of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbid the view of private pictures .
the reason why you can spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; of course , you can spend hours over time so you want to look at some time . for this reason , &amp; photo album ; this is the reason you can start preview , as described in .
the viewer you can see in . it shows of course the image , but additional all the information you have about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc .
if the Info@@ Box can be seen on the upper part of the picture you can see , you can also configure it with your mouse and click anywhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all . all these options are available on the viewer right click the viewer below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser gives you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene as if you would have chosen people from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back , by using the buttons on high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can then run it as a slide . &amp; photo album ; invites you to press a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it can press a new image by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or Min@@ us . launched and stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful skill of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; can it be changed to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to change in full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer you can easily drag the viewer into the image . you can easily draw a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and displays the result of the zo@@ oming .
with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not shown zo@@ oming , so that each pixel is set on the screen of a pixel image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make note to the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you can view images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to set out on the image . in the moment you can watch the check and configuration dialog of the picture , but you might only consider the picture to mark and see further images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the images and select it as good or bad , while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features , while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you are using the corresponding letters . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so you can see all the images you want , print or whatever you choose . this is in detail . then you can use a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and particularly features can be displayed in front view . if you can view the categories in the view screen , then you can add features to the pictures by simply press the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you can watch &amp; photo@@ album ; on the picture .
the painted structure is not stored in the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your cold later .
in a picture you can see a picture on the painted screen . in order to check out the painting of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in order to finish the painting from the context menu . simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to know the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you must not fully control the documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire @-@ screen views yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time , but not the object object of an already chosen object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ etion either from the menu bar under editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply this change . if you have invalid values , you will report a message with error description . then you can click on the input errors and disc@@ ard changes to user .
when you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the self @-@ economic view .
press preview in the self @-@ economic view and a small example of the scene is rounded off with the chosen texture . if you want to render the entire texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check out locally .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model display . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling the mouse throughout the window .
each object has a visual object as a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility of the parent or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only then , if they are selected or their visible cycle is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar chosen for the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window en@@ code as default . the object tree and view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window alignment , or if you need another arrangement , you can set it on any way . you can also save multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anch@@ oring a window over or under one view , drag the anchor to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the anchor on the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be ancho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you would like to sub@@ ordin@@ ate several views one another , drag the anchor in the middle to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card card cutting edge to the views .
the last possible wind@@ ings are floating views : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from the anchor , drag the anchor on the desktop or click on the small arrow above shown arrow in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ tion .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ f@@ water bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are web@@ bing , you can anchor at any point .
the current window view can store you with a view window . it is displayed a dialogue in which you can save the window orders under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . this version is in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering the symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ ame a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can install any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview up to full range of quality .
if you click on icon The R@@ ender icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View View menu ... select the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , it is useful , but a name that lets you know the mode of mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the Sl@@ ender@@ tone image . if you want to render only one small section of the picture , select the check@@ box sub@@ section and enter the image cut into the input fields .
in the drop down quality you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering , using a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection illumination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is planted with only one ray per pixel , you may have different mistakes in curves and lines , and sometimes details do not appear when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technology called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , pictures with this characteristic look better .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is repeatedly split and adap@@ tive because the threshold values depend on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray has a ray per pixel . if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixel , then both pixels are calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth value of a set of 5 additional points , a grid value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r . 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each . when the difference between color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixels in 4 sub @-@ pixel will be divided and the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn off J@@ itter@@ ing , the rays change a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final adjustment for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet complete the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this includes the source text of the object in the open text file in the editor , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the item tree .
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also paste .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called , if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is running . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the Help window , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported are the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you enter files that are not in the folder , you will also need to enter the path to these files . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in camera view and in the window type license number .
you can set the object catch of points on the pitch in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately here for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detail stage for two directions .
if you cross high detail drawings for extended projec@@ tions , all wireless camera views are used further , if the camera has an extended projection screen . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions of perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall displays a wall behind the objects . the wall is represented in a box pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a floor becomes underneath the objects . the floor is represented in a box pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the cant@@ onal centre check the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ recur@@ sive method for the ren@@ dering scenes is used . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . accurate information to parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in section window orders will explain how to create and store window orders .
the combination array Standard window regul@@ ates : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window alignment when starting the program .
the list Add existing window orders displays all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window alignment is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views of the chosen window . new views can be created using the button Add and remove selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with a new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with in@@ lets you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card , the view is not installed in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and now , and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this tutorial , you should get the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a ball at one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you complain that you as a result you can only use a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for the ren@@ dering can be applied as a result you receive a black image .
if you don &apos;t add any light sources , your whole scene is dark and you &apos;ll only receive a black image .
if you have all installed correctly , see &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er at the start of the first set of windows :
take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and icons often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry to delete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you are in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view from the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the outcome of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the content of view object features , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , but note that the camera in view points has to change with which you can change the camera in view points . just click on the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired place .
if you press the button User or the button , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately depending on these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the view of the camera here .
there are lots of ways to create the ground for the scene . you might need to insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ tion Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a logical method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers actually an easier way to use . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button User or button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ top view also displays the level , even though at the moment only as a limited level . if you render the scene , the plain extends up to the horizon .
if you view the object tree precisely , you will find that you can fl@@ atten the entry for the ground . in this case you will see the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line only in order to get to know some of these parameters . select Dis@@ placement and set the values as follows :
first , choose the floor to adjust its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but choose a bit aches in the moment .
in both cases , a dialog box in which you can choose how to insert the object . please choose the name in the object tree . you can see the name in the object tree ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pig@@ ment looks like .
of course , the preview of the Pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material , because you still need to check settings for the pig@@ ment . do you always remember to check the colors of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many options , but take advantage of the easiest option .
if you don &apos;t see a color on Qu@@ ader and Kugel in the preview , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you need to enter two new attributes . here you need to do two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can do this also more often , but the chess board list can be used only with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select each one and change the colors in the view of the object characteristics :
this step should you just be able to accomplish this , as you should have understood the fundamental ways of work &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball . the ball is just as easy as the floor can be done :
in the view of the object features you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the button or the button ) , so the ball would float above the ground , as you have moved the soil around a unit down .
of course , the ren@@ dering now gives a strange result : as before you see , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to you . as already in the ground , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
choose the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then select In@@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screenshot photos and click Apply or press the input key .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you have already lear@@ nt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you are looking for a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ ces , the Ren@@ ate hypo@@ the@@ tical R@@ ays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera to display the scenes ) through any pixel by the objects and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmosph@@ eric effects act like fog . so , the scene pixel is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see it without a camera , the camera is your eye on which you can view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simple black . obviously , every scene needs to be changed , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in default file dialog , you can select a file that you have before using &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored in the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
highlights the scene in the previous version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you do not have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used editing .
saves the current window en@@ code and opens up a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog for change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change the default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands or add new commands .
opens up a dialog for setting up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove commands with this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to perform rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic body . these models are then processed further to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by applying a image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select pictures for viewing .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
you can adjust whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or if all images will always use the same window .
if you are searching for a certain file , simply type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right hand corner . if a password file is displayed , you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialogue setting - &amp; ball show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of work &amp; balls . in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the short@@ cut for the respective windows .
if the picture is selected , then the images will be filled in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is no full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , invites you to watch the next picture in the folder , while you still have the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next picture , and is especially suitable for slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ball show ; when moving the name of the last folder , the next start &amp; the next folder opens ; this folder will open in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with selected color .
you can &amp; ball show ; to set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also represent the program .
with this option the display window is enlarged to the full screen . this option is enabled for default .
specify if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between image changes in a slideshow . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . if set to 0 the slideshow will be canc@@ eled until it is canc@@ eled until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to enter the value , you can use a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
click here the short@@ cut for the various modes of &amp; ball show ; in the flash@@ cards sh@@ ear commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short description .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short description .
the picture is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the images . &amp; ball show ; it is also closed when no browser window is opened .
see the picture in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first signs of fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; Re@@ place photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; image processing based on &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . &amp; place photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; project .

&amp; Re@@ place photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that user and developers will help each other . if you are asked to answer other users of &amp; show photo ; however , you can answer any questions about another user of &amp; show photo ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , and you should be powerful in this language .
the best start to join &amp; place photo ; to take part , it is the developer mailing list . guide to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show photo ; .
&amp; Place photo ; try to give you much control of its working processes as possible . in order to access this settings , you have to set up a lot of options . the setup dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
in exposure inde@@ xes , you can select the color , which is indicated when the sub@@ - or over@@ load indi@@ scri@@ bed has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ies should display colors with what you should display , in contrast . sub@@ exposure should display a bright color and exposure of dark color .
the main window of &amp; space photo ; possesses a side bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also see this page in the image processing . you can view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than pictures to scan and shar@@ per .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and save images , which can no longer power than images , or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before storing .
you can check the status of your scanner at the san@@ e project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ co@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selection of the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop off &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; end .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) do not treat these options .
to can@@ on an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ slide and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the pre@@ set can start by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom out into the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in this way that the complete preview fits in the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if saving a preview display in the settings , then the image is shown in a window showcase , as shown below , when saving is pressed , then the image is saved and S@@ lie ? EN leads to a demol@@ ition and you will return to the main window .
through the button settings , the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; they will automatically save the dialog with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without any fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the store without any fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change it .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the image automatically to save images and is also the given name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved picture will receive a numer@@ ic suff@@ ix of jed@@ es@@ mal if a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to store . this value also changes the compression value when select . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE aid with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; The button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to end .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs short@@ cut . below , you can set up a list of this pump@@ ing click on the Player window , and select a key short@@ cut by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window , click on the Player window and set short commands .
you may need to set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands work . thereby you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok still has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user does not run .
not@@ ifications for &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Er@@ ror error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / template you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can easily use it as a base for your own scripts . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; whatever the K@@ DE installation should be included .
most script@@ ing languages enable the output of external programs and commands . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simply . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends not@@ ifications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are going to monitor their default scripts and react accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to view the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data each script must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok requires the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script might now be &amp; z@@ b ; for example , using D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or part length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . volume level is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu bar , Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined item can be used . to remove the script called d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script by d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script . d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu bar ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok stops ; or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do it for example , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using a web server . we recommend a archive name as for example n@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can optionally also be identified with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be identified with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 you will only accept script pack@@ ets with the extension of amar@@ an@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets correctly .
the key script must be executable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be executable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , yet surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply pull music into the playlist instead of moving through endless menus . maybe you are looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting instructions and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right one for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used to listen to your music . these and yet many other useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; does , like most applications , has some options which can enable or disable the configure tim@@ eline with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
certain depen@@ dencies have to be fulfilled for some of the comp@@ ile options , so that they can be used . details to find in the system requirements .
activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you &apos;re in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; help you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can set up without effort via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several maps for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
to use voice bar@@ ometer , this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this option switches the experimental function of the pac@@ if@@ ometer .
to create atmosph@@ eric design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme for the mood barrier .
if this setting is activated in the music files , this function is only available if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list .
playlist the playlist , save the current playlist to the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you don &apos;t want to lose .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
visu@@ alize actual piece of items visible , that the play@@ lists window can hold / off , in order to always keep the ongoing piece always in the visible window area .
when shifting in the context of context @-@ browser , displays the context @-@ browser automatically , as soon as the next piece is played .
in the appearance of the appearance , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is in three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following area . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player windows and context @-@ browser . push for selecting ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection custom color scheme you have the choice of choice and define your own color scheme . use the selected color selection for front and background colour .
playback at the start Will causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback automatically with the piece at the point , with which it was stopped at the end of the program .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effects of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD card . the check box shadow is shown that the text is sh@@ ady in the O@@ SD .
own colours are you the possibility to adapt the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color area opens the dialog for color selection . if own colours do not use activated , the default &amp; k@@ de is used .
the input field Display text will display the O@@ SD displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adjusted its own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . so you can decide on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment will appear on the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box . some drivers activate more adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the map collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . that includes folders and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for adjusting , as with selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and the sub@@ folders according to music is used .
changes : enable &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search will be done to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import playlist : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your Colle@@ cting folder ( .@@ pl@@ and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) will be added to your collection . then , the play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part Colle@@ ct database is used to select a database for the collection . combination Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another device is necessary in the sub@@ panel MySQL setup .
the MySQL device section is used for inser@@ ting the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it is used on the MySQL database . after that , the database name is entered , using the database name . name : is the database name to which the connection is manufactured .
use username : and password : to enter the data you need for connection to the database .
the flash@@ card v@@ .@@ f@@ m is the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create your own music recommendations on the current piece .
here you enter your User@@ name and Password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send out pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar musicians to retri@@ eve : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar musicians to that played , you can see the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok requires only the k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included in it , for example both modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD requires that your window manager will function the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably you will find one of your files a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can view the file format by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log also . please tell that the file caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and allow the collection again .
mostly this is because Tag@@ lib is crashing while reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit mature .
make sure all of you were compiled by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same compiler version . if you were compiled with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when editing the Meta information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then turn off the machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the email opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is an frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be solved .
this is because many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 in the Meta @-@ Infos , but it is not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; Get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; $ $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random / repet@@ ition / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . these are a well @-@ known bugs in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can specify the status down@@ lighted on grey and semi transparent . note that in some cases you can click on a symbol for up to three times , until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : icon Loo@@ kup error : symbolic symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .conf such that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are easiest to check with the help of a expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or at the developers . please use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ och@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o.@@ c .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error if something is located at the container of a bug in Amar@@ ok .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do you get into music there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window is converted into the statist@@ ic window . you will find it under some ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate each piece , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist and select column column . click anywhere in the new application column , to specify the evaluation of a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button to your selection and then select from the playlist menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist and let it drop down , just as you would do with other files . this is that simple : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the playlist .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config is missing to you . install the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . see also by lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the Equalizer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find it via the menu bar below ex@@ tras ...
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; therefore , uses G@@ ather@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support such pretty thou@@ ght@@ ful audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG code !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied with a MP3 Decoder ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Regist@@ aste
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must be used a bl@@ ender . this can be achieved by a sound card using the hardware Mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software Mixer ) . take a look at the Help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem and help you find a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you might have to specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok , already . don &apos;t forget that media will need to de@@ code first . you can only listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .

use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :

either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less income re@@ acts the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , that is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . run @-@ register to record all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask at IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok earlier ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg file , comp@@ ile and install it . then run the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with file @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run off @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

this command can be done by Amar@@ ok ; it is sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok will start before you go to bed , then you will be spar@@ ked by the soft tones of music that you have stopped at bed@@ time .
how to get this current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpre@@ ter and title of the running unit : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA _ RSA _ user your@@ name - Amar@@ ok player nov@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the windows can be separated on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size of changeable window .

basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a dec@@ lining value based on how often the play was played , the less influence has been played on the overall result .
you can add the valu@@ ation for a piece by clicking on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then , mark the evaluation of a piece in the play@@ lists window , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece , and edit : rating , select or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog metadata .
the developers do not want to release you when you are supposed to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan which cannot be combined with the short notice provided by Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in amar@@ ok , but some users can certainly also find annoying . disable the option icon to play in the general settings .

presumably have been compiled &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you install x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine has not compiled this output modules . you must re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I am &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably use a distribution that is installed the program files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developers are missing . you must now also install the package for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine dev@@ el ; then you have to re @-@ comp@@ ile and install it again .

I have a second sound card and I use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
using settings Amar@@ ok set up ... Audio output specify the device . for example , HW : 0 for the standard sound card and HW : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers of Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
LA@@ ME : a well developed MP3 Decoder can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . LA@@ ME is used by the MP3 Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used from the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for processing various audio formats . for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t wma files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ x : a help program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyze video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard stage ; i.e. , for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 @-@ collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording level can result in the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces can be rendered differently loud .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to re@@ boot from CD and automatically give all videos to the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the corresponding sub @-@ menu provides a list of these projects . one click on an entry brings the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed , with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you &apos;d call for any individual project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what to happen . you can then drop between Save and Chan@@ ges . besides , you can also stop closing and stop the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any saved project what to happen , as if you would have called for any project file .
includes all open projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for any saved project will be asked what to happen , as if you would have called File Close .
when you visit this entry , you can select the same effect as if you view the files directly from the top view into the Project View . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folders of the CD .
opens the dialogue &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog for the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium , it can only open when the project contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can do many projects related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful to use files from a previous session in the current project . this is useful for you to use files for a multi @-@ purpose CD . it &apos;s always been used for you as a help , so that you can already see files and folders on the medium .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the media , it will flash the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use only one image from a CD which will then also be able to burn one CD instead of normal copying . you should also prefer to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this also enables copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use only one image from a DVD with the help of a DVD with the help of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . you can delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
open the dialog for form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format which is completely deleted by the content . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to make the choice between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ ment@@ ell .
burn a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which is then not supported immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools like N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously established DVD image . the dialog will take you after a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned down immediately by pushing the burning button .
a previously released DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog window is commonly used after reading a DVD in the table view , but it may also be used to unlock information about modi@@ fying the video , body settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the covered medium . this information is displayed in the table view and contain properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small glue is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
if the folder view is switched on or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , the content menu will also be displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or throw of the medi@@ ums .
switches the table view or off . the table view allows selecting and pulling files into the project view . the table view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ line is switched on or off the head@@ line in the project view , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks very pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens an dialog window to change key@@ codes for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be adjusted for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator privileges are required , so you must enter the password for system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be performed . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work correctly . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alize and for fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or something more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . therefore , both programs are critical as functions and the type of your task is vital to which the accompanying programs you give .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is launched ; then enter a bit like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; - program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ My@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref creamy Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) : D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref creamy C@@ dr@@ v ( ) void of the void of the void of the void of the void of the void of the void .
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via the # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void of the void void no@@ p@@ add@@ l ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String parent , Q@@ String ) , Q@@ String body , Q@@ String body , Q@@ String path , Q@@ String path , Q@@ String body , Q@@ String _ name ) void with the Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ( Q@@ String )
with this , it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ ders / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p / or fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; is an audio CD ; Reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; it can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the release of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and of many enco@@ ders , which are supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ sy @-@ free compression ) . more co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) is compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ prec@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile something yourself . but if for example FLA@@ C does not use it , its installation will not be required .
what codi@@ fication / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ th@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ bl@@ .@@ cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection . if not the mechanism of copying it is possible . simply avoid the mechanism of cop@@ ing protection . avoid the purchase of head @-@ protected audio CD ; S !
while setting up only once has to be done ( the setup dialog , however , is often called up to a suitable configuration ) , will follow the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) for the slim approach of the user interface , which will often be proud of the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the Free@@ D@@ b comes out of the Internet or can work entirely without network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step for step example are more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program configuration .
the CD@@ DB request of the CD data is set according to the device of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case it must first be connected to the Internet . )
starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoder settings tab in the directive al@@ ogue - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of the available encoder , so that the option can be read from another encoder as the standard . it is to be observed that the encoder is configured in the tab settings dialog in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already released file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; copies and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as protocols , pie@@ p@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ates ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter contains sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder &apos;s choice .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and no available commercial devices that can play these files .
under the audio formats , which lose information through data comp@@ ress depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences will produce less important , as both Ko@@ th@@ inner is very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be provided with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality when compared to deeper bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing og@@ g @-@ playing equipment is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most music
the --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting is usually meant for most people and most of the pieces of music @-@ acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires ever 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint Stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ ug for music by yo@@ ungst@@ ers , portable devices and auto@@ graph@@ e@@ o@@ plants . but not good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo equipment .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which manually input or retri@@ eved through the program automatically from the Free@@ D@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used to create files and file names to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switches on these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) , if MP3@@ s are encoded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added to l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gies ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... w@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gens ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database , in which people can download / enter the audio CDs instead of playing in the calcul@@ ator . it is to be noted that here only by text can be downloaded here : &amp; CD ; titles , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( apart from the U@@ e@@ ber@@ iser ) I &apos;m not an attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither can &apos;t be added to the artist or CD ; more or less worth@@ less , no other information can be received by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ da ; it is actively used to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used when calling the server ( this can only know the program@@ mers who reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ke is set up ; for use of Free@@ D@@ b , the ge@@ ographic is to be used on the closest mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; for information on reading a &amp; CD ; or alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which display program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that are using cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; if you want to know it more precisely , look at the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading Audio CD ; . to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed first if this is not done .
to save the original WAV files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab on this tab . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the codi@@ le package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the codi@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined Ko@@ th@@ erer . more information on Ko@@ th@@ erer are found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ th@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information about its switch can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) &apos; l@@ ame &apos; to be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this may have many causes . please check the device of the device number of the CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read real of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to specify both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might give us a note of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still in@@ secure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , arrange everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to use MP3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
it must be installed cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame on your machine . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile a search engine , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which of course you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to them ( eg ; by trying to copy something into account ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ da , something that is thought to be done only once , and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for each tap@@ ered &amp; CD ;
here we are determining the used co@@ di@@ ers for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program to use the Free@@ D@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it when reading a &amp; CD ; change when the right settings are found .
the device number is handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; - data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stick and a try with the existing entries for the CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives .
the card card General Settings . here you will not have much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything is left / typ@@ ed as shown on screen photo .
only in case of incomplete information , so you will be informed when data are missing from keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download over the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; so that it can be connected to the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; found immediately the release of the CD title and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , can be easily changed with the database name and the default directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ;
apart from this example , you can continue to note : if you want to use everything manually , you can use the Free@@ D@@ b locally in offline mode , if you want to use the database before . however , it is worth watching the two selection fields , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data enquiry for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the Free@@ D@@ b server on the Internet . how knows the system that data will get the CD ? read the section on Free@@ D@@ b . put everything as shown on screen photo .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look at a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load is distributed between the computers . this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls are using the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf on the web .
in this example , we don &apos;t want &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check box should be used .
simply apply the settings of your screen photo . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously allow@@ able pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and coding ? the author does not know it , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last part , please tick this on the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user defin@@ itive folder for temporary files : if you can specify this , then the path / folders are specified , in which the WAV files is stored . this can &apos;t be useful if only space is installed on a different drive . if you don &apos;t forget to do the files in a private folder , you don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files .
all so as it is on the screen picture . the command is a little bit long , under circumstances must be blind@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the record &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of creating tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in your screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : a single @-@ core or multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic device of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; termin@@ ated . this configuration is used as a standard for every release of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
in this section is described as described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is described , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ D@@ b will be set up . the process is described in this section , must be repeated for each tap@@ ing &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet included in Free@@ D@@ b , the screen photos will see a bit different from the free@@ ware of Free@@ D@@ b . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually to pick it out of the Internet . comments will point out to the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as on the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully from the Free@@ D@@ b , all tracks of the songs are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; specifies a window to your &amp; CD ; and you can select the database entry , which is best suited to your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ Settings in the dialog for the Settings ) . if you do not have any local database , but need data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the play in the first line of the &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; field .
the artist must no longer be entered in the &apos; Up@@ eller title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ger@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eve of the data from the Free@@ D@@ b , the CD editor is not blank , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e. g. all words with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album , and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have to set up an unlimited field of field ; at least , this option will be set up in the tab settings &apos; tab settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the Tag Editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the Ko@@ edi@@ an to get more information .
simply select an entry , which is obviously not correct with the style of the trigger CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are available under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields have already been filled with the recorded data , which we have covered for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the song in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
note that it has a check @-@ out before each line of one piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of each piece , or use the button all the pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at a time .
was started by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process , so this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is running out .
click on the Rider &apos;s orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read out on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you &apos;re trying to work with a co@@ di@@ aler , which you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error has occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , output and coding are parallel . observe the status review in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . at powerful machines the machine used with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous expres@@ sing and coding ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ gies , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; it is today maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS , as part of the iconic media package . if you are familiar with CVS , you can already read from there an anonymous copy . if you &apos;re reading this package , you may already read this package from your distribution . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is addressed to persons , comp@@ iling from source files , and not for users who are using a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step example of the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , ever read yet ? even if only the help menu is clicked after the first time start of the program , without any trading point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what about it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no E @-@ Mail . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it is the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ster ; it is intended to do it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this passage and is therefore agreed with this suggestion .
strange when we managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others he does not have some real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real read@@ just@@ ices of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players did not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project drivers , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel as caused by raising the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go into &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from one &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; windows can be dra@@ gged onto K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ orders or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; ch@@ mid ; you can also work with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and activate the button play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry strip from the menu item or enter the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; - ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one another . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b and forth .
if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows to turn left and on the right of the tempo switch . to get back the original speed , double click on the tempo LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure affects the space bar as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu click in the menu , supp@@ resses the space bar while no play is played , k@@ icks off &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use Lie@@ dt@@ exter@@ ity and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is used automatically , so you will need to manually set the Karaoke text . but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to specify a type of events you choose from the menu Settings menu items or song events . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these will be played by the series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . find this in the menu collection under the point organizer .... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included at the beginning of the same songs as original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the time in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to no other collection .
when leaving the application this collection is not saved . remember that if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to add a song . in turn , you can select the file dialog , with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the option auto adding to the collection .
if automatic add @-@ up to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . then this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click away .
you can select the order in which the songs are played off . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu image sequence of the menus , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list on the Karaoke text .
to jump a song , select the Next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button in the previous piece , the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to clear a collection , open the collection manager , select the gathering collection here and click the button to delete .
temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is stored on leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer which are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create an MIDI @-@ Map that converts all events of the Change patch Serum to B@@ right piano in events of the Change patch Serum to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always allow a trumpet to be heard if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all required changes to play a piece .
each section may only appear , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as many times as desired . the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for this is , however , that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you can see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patches from General MIDI to be depicted on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ator is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and do not leave the line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to lay all the sounds that use this instrument to sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do so , wear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
if now an MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( ri@@ f@@ ice ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant , in which every sound represents another per@@ cent@@ ering instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one in which the sound does the pitch of the always same drum ( like some keyboards have it ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are primarily used to form tones on the perc@@ us@@ sions channel . take a look at the supplied key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to change the first and the second channel , make it easy for the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option for this channel , all events will need to be ignored in the file ! if you try to change the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will need to change the patch on this canal . in this case , patch is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ us@@ sions @-@ patch on the perc@@ us@@ sions channel .
the value for P@@ itch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio can be multiplied in which ratio pitch @-@ ben@@ der events will be multiplied by the value n , this will be used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to do so in the map file ( no dec@@ imal comm@@ as ) .
this setting is needed because GM is prefer@@ able to play a pitch with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards do not need to play two tones up to a oc@@ tave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use an MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu , dot MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this Kla@@ vi@@ aturen you can see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to view the played tones . in the menu , select Settings under the Point channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays speed to play with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . therefore , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to turn left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the scores , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can perform in two different devices with very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; because it happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add into &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; - Window .
in advance , you need to add automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow keys left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard speed , click the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; cont@@ ent@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play an MIDI file or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window , and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ) .
if you want to listen quickly a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off the settings Automatic Add to Collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection .
let us assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ C and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so , put the settings Automatic Add to Collection and open A@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this an MIDI file .
then you decide to play also B.@@ M@@ ID and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , animated me , continue to program &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; but I try to take a bit time for my hob@@ bies . as Hob@@ bies , I have a bit of time for my hob@@ bies . as hob@@ bies , I have a bit of time to make MIDI files , making music and prove phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ k@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all of you will send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to receive a MIDI file , but if you want to contact me , I might already have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written completely in my spare time and made by no eman@@ ating money for it . I would like to emphas@@ ize that I only accept news , because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it runs as if you could have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .

&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD , or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central list . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when displaying information in it .
it is possible to save the preferred links using the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category permanent playlist .
naturally , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy of hierarchy . if you add an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the selected entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and continuous playlist can also be changed by direct Edit@@ ing of XML configuration files . of course you can only do it by default , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category click on it from the menu View and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when processing mode or a different group is selected without the playlist to the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation at starting and running can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ server option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation while starting does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening a source . this would be distur@@ bing in the end animation , however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of an animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path from the player and the cache size of the data flow from the network and other things can be adjusted .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this r@@ end@@ ition device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; you can even insert the special field of Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages must be re@@ activated , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog File assign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be found in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module . if there are no errors , the Back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to keep a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been obtained ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on will be retri@@ eved for all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play on TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before the TV channels can be configured , the scanner should be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port is to be found , one of which is selected to be selected . ( for example , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably included a DVB input .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is also the only one that works ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server should also be working . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , this must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally they are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they begin to start playing the playlist .
are there indications as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play off from it ( not from the VCD / / / ? ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely secure that / dev / c@@ drom show on the CD@@ ROM drive .

QT ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile .
latex ; : professional Writ@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be accessed by the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Distribution included . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be cons@@ ulted .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project also contains some compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow an easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; web site included .
this manual is suitable for anyone , regardless of the experience of latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ha@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this hand@@ book . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation should be desired , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; - website .
please ask questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ; on or if expan@@ sions requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling , editing and bug@@ ging tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to find out more about &amp; Kate and its opportunities to learn the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ha@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; latex ; is the correct pron@@ unci@@ ation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . is difficult to use , also a loader ( English lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros can also use it . a less sophisticated but realistic setting is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here just a good visibility to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to be given . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
the same as other mark@@ er languages contains &amp; latex ; an introduction , with which the common characteristics described as paper format , page number@@ ing and text bur@@ ners , the Cologne begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } again .
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a substantial function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard offers for the creation of the document . it can also be applied to the document related settings .
document classes : with this , the type of document is shown : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; book &#93; , articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , projector &#91; ... &#93; &#93; or user defined .
coding : this allows the encoding of the system to be used . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UTF @-@ 8x encoding should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the usually used additional packages for latex ; for the integration they can only be selected in the check@@ box .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used when creating German texts .
new users are now not worried . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about it is given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; it offers - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ones ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; you should have noticed that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it saves you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it saves you through the emphasis of time and over time .
with the automatic adjustment of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ ) , { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for input text ) and the added line to close the command ( e.g. \ \ by { command } ) . this function can set up in the menu items ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; provides the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ cut@@ ted element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective .
when creating the own &amp; latex ; - files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; female unlimited file &#93; . once a DVI ; -@@ viewer : by one click with the middle button in DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font or font . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and print of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and spaces .
when using the door search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file has been clicked on an element in the DVI ; file has been clicked on the exact opposite . once on a section in &amp; latex ; source code was clicked on , it will jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a Master @-@ Document , work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . in the use of a project , a project management project can be set to project project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result automatically displays ( unless an error occurred in the source code ) .
file watch : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ File will be on the hard@@ board , and no appeal is made by &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; following the speed@@ way .
when considering the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be followed for the fast link of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The contractual &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for the division are :
the drop down is for items such as words , rows , notes or references . these are :
name : with this command , a designation for a section , image or different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a fixed name ( selection above a sel@@ ector ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; - files are appropriate editors ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and / k@@ bi@@ b ; - files can also be attributed to &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; - files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ .@@ e is used for the definition of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the boxes no@@ des , etc . there are the following text notes for distribut@@ ing :
with the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two sel@@ ections are available for the purpose : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fixed st@@ ack@@ able settings . 2 . the document can be attributed to the hand by hand .
the cl@@ amps according to the command \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ aries contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the fonts in the command . if the font is not set to the beginning , this may also be published in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; latex has to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu building or button extension .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
conclusions of the document fail@@ ures should be sought in the recording after the errors . if using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; if it is not the case , the protocol should also be started .
an environment ( English @-@ environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font names shall have been created , and only a couple of places should have been given to a different font . the command \ \ &apos; , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ by { environment } can be added to the full view of the font inside the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the human changes are only c@@ auti@@ ous within the environment ( from \ \ &apos; to { environment } up to \ &apos; end { environment } ) . there is no detection ( number ) for the current changes within one environment .
there are many opportunities to listen to the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . it can be found for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , short pressure , sub@@ str@@ ations , etc . these commands are either related to the command \ \ &apos; or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Vie@@ wing } : this command is for the short pressure and is available as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be illustrated with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; begin { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ by { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to write the source text with latex ; mark@@ up language is presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once the wiz@@ ard has been given a bit of text , a few adjust@@ ments should be completed for the better read@@ ability of the document . you should have a quote , a few places in the fat and short pressure and a poem to be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor display or C@@ tr@@ l E can be turned back to the editor ( when an external viewer ) the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; -@@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a medium file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ beam ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - can be printed on DVI ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar support the conversion of the DVI ; -@@ file in other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; latex ; source code has been created , the conversion could start in more formats by using the Kn@@ Ã ¶ PF@@ E in the tool@@ bar .
the for@@ age search encouraged the direct jump from the editor to the added position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ aries only need to set up Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... tools for building full .
in order to express the advance look , the mouse cur@@ sor must be placed in a row of the source text , and close on pre@@ ference . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then carried out .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with one click of the Middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; designated and to the corresponding line . this must be &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; defined as text editor ( setting ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ... editor )
if using quick @-@ making of the &amp; DVI ; viewer can &apos;t be able to make an error . if a bug is present , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file extension refers to the source code in source code . in the editor you can see the buttons used between errors . in order to view the error file , the log file must be clicked on the error in the log file and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the error in the log file .
once on the button labeled in tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template used for the document . the default toll is :
for selecting an empty document , a document can be re@@ written either by reason or the wiz@@ ard for quick creation of a new document . further information about this is included in the section .
average user of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either must be either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; -@@ file open or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using the existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings General .
when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string is used by typ@@ ing in document class . typically it will be used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the related commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps were completed :
when creating a new document can be used to create your own template instead of def@@ aults .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created . a simple way to create a template should be selected according to one on the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Hot ; used &amp; Kate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for a programmer with the ability of reading and her@@ b@@ ating of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made out of volume tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
to know more about Kate and Kate . to find out the things the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ha@@ ile ; can you start reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called for the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X Reference . you can find a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; you can find them as well as their syntax .
double click with penet@@ rated Str@@ g key to eliminate the &amp; tex ; that means that this way will be selected on \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ .
when pulling the text with penet@@ rated left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated reverse , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most different types of source texts and emphas@@ ize them . for example , the &amp; latex contains ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another colour .
many assist@@ ants are possible to trade . this is a unique type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu will also encourage the jump to the last or last jump brand . this jumping stamp is also highlighted , so that it is automatically added to the first input of a character .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate . great functions for writing a &amp; latex ; contains important functions for the writing of a &amp; latex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit menu , the following commands are included :
if a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which included on both sides of a blank line ) . this extended meaning is not a text with continuous lines of text ( like in other text editors ) . this is the only beu@@ ti@@ fying thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the only beu@@ ti@@ fying thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the precip@@ itation is separated by two empty lines .
if the word commands a current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an advanced meaning , since this command also contains &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to listen to a part of this document , it can be easily removed and removed by pressing the key . &amp; Kate ; provides a faster solution for a faster connection . under editing , the following commands are provided for a faster result :
a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit fail@@ ures .
it has already been clear that environments such a central role in &amp; latex ; for this reason , &amp; k@@ ile ; for example , offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under edit environment , for a really good work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command to jump to the beginning of current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to dis@@ connect the surrounding area .
with this command to jump to the end of current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ &apos; birth place } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many w@@ aved ambient commands , the most recent environment can quickly be lost . this command touches the last open environment , so that the missing environment structure is not consumed .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are intended to be determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands to those from the Edit environment .
this command is to jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the current bracket .
this command is to jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded tu@@ b@@ ular bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the th@@ wart@@ ed cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
during the input of many w@@ aved groups of cl@@ amps , the previous group can quickly be lost . this command touches the last party &apos;s structure , so that the f@@ ailing structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be dis@@ continued .
in &amp; latex ; the sign used for the purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for the purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for the purpose is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and offers two close contact signs for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic access code can be set up with Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and will be sign@@ posted .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ text or French ) , and with it German or French appropri@@ ations . there are also many other languages available .
at the drums of Shift ; Regist@@ aste &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( such as enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , available &amp; k@@ ha@@ ile ; not only a line breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
in a tables environment , connect &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ , with a close line breaks .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line default &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . set up these can be added to Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users wanted to arrange the columns in tables environments and all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) ; searches &amp; k@@ ha@@ ile ; after the highest table in the opposite line . even though this tab@@ ulator is not the added table , for stu@@ gt &amp; k@@ ha@@ ile ; some spaces for the columns are added to the current tab .
although &amp; Kate , this is a good source of source code , it was added in &amp; k@@ ile ; for some specific commands ( mostly available for &amp; latex ; ) , three modes have been built for automatic adjustment . all of these modes can be set up for different work@@ ways under att@@ itudes K@@ ile ... can be set out .
when starting a new environment through the command \ \ &apos; starts { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ by { environment } on an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the button bar , the last letter is removed from the input and you can &apos;t be fool@@ ish@@ ingly , the list can also shr@@ ink by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameter . the descriptions are nat@@ ured by selecting an command . alternatively , it is possible to jump to these positions with the editing markers of the bottom mark@@ er mark , and the known parameters will then be frozen .
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Full settings to these lists can be performed . it can be selected to be selected by various W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as to the general usage of the general language .
the command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . it is always used a few letters with \ \ &apos; s time and the call of the completion is used . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ha@@ ile ; a special mode for the adjustment of the environments to be used .
when inv@@ ading the full editing mode , the command can be closed automatically and it will appear \ \ &apos; s start button . after that , the environment will be continued in the easiest way and will be completed by selecting the input key .
after this is accomplished the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command will be included .
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Full Settings to these lists . this mode uses the code list of the default mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ score user @-@ defined lists of deliber@@ ate cuts , which can immediately be set up by default strings . the lists can be set up with att@@ aching K@@ ile ... K@@ ile comprehen@@ sively serves as an example of an ab@@ rup@@ tly list . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
if the letter is entered , for example , the letter L is entered and the word processor should be added to the code or the CTR@@ L + Alt space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large w@@ rest@@ ors are not helpful for automatic adjustment . however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ens are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion for all written sites are written .
this mode can set up in the menu Settings ... K@@ ile must be deported . here , the swelling can be specified for the display of the adjustment .

the dialog graphics are designed to form graphics so simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , sections and sections should be considered .
PS @-@ files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for all the changes and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is provided , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools are re@@ arranged and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to watch the result of the work , you have to be compiled in the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menu creation , creating comp@@ iling and creating view .
for the compilation of the source code for be@@ holder as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further conversion may be used by pressing alt ; 3 viewed , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file into a PS file converted and using Alt ; 5 the PS file is regarded .
when using the command quick , a viewer is normally called upon comp@@ iling . if there is no embedded viewer , then every time will open a new window .

if the file should be selected in &amp; quantitative , then you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file select file by using the other file .
enter the name of the file as the result will have been named , and the file is usually stored in their home folder .
the plug@@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ anti@@ des ; la@@ im , have with &amp; quant@@ um . even if the plug@@ in system does not have to do so much . you can &apos;t wait until someone does not need to do so . plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . these plug @-@ ins can be used in more detail below .
to install a plug@@ in or a part , we begin with the Edit plug@@ ins menu . thus , the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the plug @-@ in plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe every &amp; GUI element :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a memory place is used &amp; quantitative ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several persons in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relation . &amp; quant@@ um lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties -@@ Dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the name of the user and serves as a unique identi@@ fier .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can select himself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates who he is . this happens when he expresses the team member from the list and press the S@@ etz@@ e button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of your team , there is another advantage by the members of the team : it can be an event for information about the team leaders , if something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are carried out if something specific in the project happens . an example would be the recording of the opening and closure of the project , so that later you can see if a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
events can be edited , edited and deleted by the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see list selected address . the address can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i are set up such ladder .
notes are special comments in the document . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note : you can either select the note message from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a commentary area followed by note text .
notes can be a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the first name of the team member , is a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team Manager Head of the area and sub@@ project lad@@ ders should be given the corresponding range or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles are independent of large or small ch@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation , but spaces around the stap@@ les and the : do the re@@ mark invalid .
&amp; quant@@ um lus ; is a development environment for script@@ ing and form@@ atting languages that DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is supported and web @-@ based form@@ atting and script@@ ing languages supported .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; quant@@ um , -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using settings Quant@@ a ... This dialog extends over a few pages that will be dealt with .
the behavior of &amp; quantitative information ; concerning tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
big / small ch@@ ab@@ ortion of tags : large / small ch@@ ab@@ ortion of automatically added tags . normal large / small ch@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation means that tags are added , as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / dec@@ lining of attributes : large / small shr@@ ink of automatically added attributes . normal large / small ch@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation means , the attributes are added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
no optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
update and closing day automatically : if switched on , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during ti@@ pping .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for detection of different types of files . using the Standard can restore the default settings .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or used in other ways than with file open open files ( where the encoding of the file can be addressed here ) , but this setting is downloaded from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is charged .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected , but this setting is downloaded from the same in project features , if a project is charged .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quantitative Analytics ; creates regular backup copies , so that the document can be restored from this backup during the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . this is not the same as saving of the file . this is not a backup regular , according to the set time created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or in an own view ( or documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings back to the standard next start is useful when the user interface by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by accumulation of no longer en@@ quiries .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in split mode .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ de in the document , can be set in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , it is possible to change the action taken by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structural settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be automatically opened to the editing and how deep when changing the structural tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups such are found in which there is no item found in the current document .
the area for determining ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations ( one type of templates ) , which are un@@ folds during the editing at a larger text . this means it can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ ic@@ ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are part applications of third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the best known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be stated :
ad@@ ress : the path to the plug @-@ in if there is not at a stand@@ ar@@ able as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be handed to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the current file ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to store this option if this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : if it is activated , then check &amp; qu@@ anti@@ de ; if the plug@@ in is correct , then the plug@@ in in the moment is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ um lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely new developed . the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in concept was implemented , enabling various implement@@ ations over plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ; Inclu@@ ded .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug into the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a project is enabled for a de@@ bu@@ gger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative interface ; -@@ U@@ I :
a view in which the content of the monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view , in which all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this promotion is used for de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug@@ in to listen to de@@ file claims by default , if a project is opened by default , which does not normally have to be considered a de@@ bu@@ gger .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , or end the sound according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to introduce a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be shown on de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
indicates de@@ bug@@ gers to start with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the current introduced line . if this happens , the execution is continued , before a de@@ br@@ ation requirement has begun , the script starts with the request .
indicates de@@ bug@@ gers to start with the execution of the script without inform@@ ing information and the current line number . if this happens when a script has been made , the execution begins as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will conduct the next statement in the script without going into the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , and if possible , in functions and includes faul@@ ts .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over and go to the next one as if there would be the current one .
opens a dialog box , in which a variable , or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the superior value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be input or a new value of a variable can be set .

documentation type Edit@@ ing pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ um . they enable &amp; quantitative ; abilities to perform mark@@ up and scripts . your simplicity and flexibility makes out of &amp; quantitative ; A fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic strip of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions faster in a document as a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , A &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quant@@ it@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bar allow a quick paste of tags in a document without a risk of writing .
tag Fol@@ ders are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the record@@ able language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so many users can have better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes any element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is displayed in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing but an element type about itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
valid only for the tag@@ typ class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( family only 2 )
yes , the day has a common attributes and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
requires a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for any attribute . additionally , it is possible to describe the name and type of attributes . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed , etc ; This is an only element type element .
specifies the source code used for filling the attributes in Tag @-@ Edit@@ ordi@@ alog , and the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative interface ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name is used within &amp; quantitative ; it is used to achieve data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method@@ ology name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % day name , that means the name of the current tags .
a container tag allows the elements of a list together . it can occur only once . it is an only element type element .
specifies the attribute text of an tags found within a dialog . this tag can only occur once in a dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; attack &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is an only element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with one &amp; XML ; - De@@ lar@@ ation start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding = 1.0 encoding .
spaces influence nothing , but look for &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog box above is in the &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not yet available . at present , checking only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functional family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; version _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is as fairly simple and there is an editor that can be handled via DT@@ D ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :

( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
a promotion can be set with Settings ... Click on New action leads to the same dialog :
the keyboard assigned to this action . with clicking the User button , a key symbol can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be input text in the detailed settings and insert this text in the document on the current cur@@ sor location . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which will change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) , even the Schnell@@ start @-@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter should be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ c@@ script@@ .@@ sh .
even though qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % script@@ ing variable in the command line , such as sh % script@@ .@@ / share / apps / qu@@ a / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we will replace the current document in the case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; only one instance is being replaced by the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; dos@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used .
the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods mentioned above , a script input from &amp; quant@@ um . in the selection box can be specified , which is to be sent to the standard input . options are :
selected text : the selected field of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal Edition , which is written on the standard output ; error messages can be done using the text written to the default output by default , by default :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in this case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you will need to add actions and configure settings .
the parts of this window are quite self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add them to the right tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes has and you plan to plan , check the dialog &quot; tag when available , so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ nat@@ i ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graph Other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 to change this , select editing size .
please note that the created symbol no longer helps you to mem@@ ori@@ ze what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day start , is , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually referred to as a symbol ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be indicated that clicking this icon will add a &amp; lt ; -@@ day in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it still needs to be associated with the promotion . this is done on the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ um ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue it with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ anti@@ de ; -@@ functions to tool@@ bar , or it should set it to better overview by some separ@@ ator in several groups . make sure the tool@@ bar is selected for the tool@@ bar .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top right ) for my tool@@ bar . after the selection of the element to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the tool@@ bar element to the tool bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note that separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; - button on the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by test@@ ifying all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
if re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ bal file , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder , so that its tool bar ( s ) should be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the respective type .
perhaps the most mentioned enlargement of &amp; quant@@ um , for the normal user is the opportunity to like documentation for the script@@ ing language or the form@@ atting language you may like . so this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , please check in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ de ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory whether someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then , we need to tell you the second part we treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these docum@@ ent@@ ations , e.g. php@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2.@@ html day = tag@@ 2.@@ html day 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html day = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 , PHP 4.2 , = Table of Cont@@ ents , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction = Mo@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syn@@ thes@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . it shows that it is about sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you can note that the contents page is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and then consequ@@ ent at the upper end of the building supervision &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but look for &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ um ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the contents section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed for designing the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context help would display the documentation directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file binding .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and go to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you read it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you &apos;re sure that these are good and worth it to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation is used to use by the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places there will be send an e @-@ mail menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; quantitative information can be downloaded , and only available when our team needs them as correct and us@@ full for publication , where@@ with it an GP@@ G / PGP key needs . thus , the source of resources will be ensured , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys to enter a new resource ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the upload will be started .
the up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , to upload tool@@ bars , and files in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , even before installation , examined &amp; quantitative ; the integrity of the resource is war@@ med and it may be canc@@ eled . please read the warning messages carefully and the resource is given correctly , a message appears with specif@@ ying the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; quantitative . however , the creation can be more time consuming because hundreds of tag files can be required in everyday XML format . there is the simpler Way to convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D store and conver@@ gence of DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target characters : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! do@@ ct@@ ype definition line : the string that will appear in ! do@@ ct@@ ype day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 /
fine tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , provides &amp; quant@@ um , following the conversion and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quant@@ um , there are some key concepts . to understand this and use full use of &amp; qu@@ anti@@ de ; this chapter will first try to bring these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative ; little benefits .
the work@@ space in three areas is divided into three areas : global , locally , and projects relating to this distinction , as a number of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quantitative ; use , available . by tool@@ bars over actions , it is saved , in the common folder structure of &amp; quantitative . this allows the group of administ@@ rators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and samples in a global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web@@ developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user folder , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special promotions are set aside for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which provides common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , tree views , flash@@ es with information and tool bar . please beat in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the boxes with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching , re@@ loading , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click on the editing pane highlighted in the editing area , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the file under the mouse cur@@ sor , or open the file when the string is described under the mouse cur@@ sor of a file .
at the top end of the editor window , the tool@@ bar of the editor is the tool@@ bar . currently , &amp; quantitative ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is shown as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars are shown . in the course of further construction of &amp; quant@@ um , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really light . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click the icon that represents the day . you may need to insert the data for this just inserted day . you should have a tag that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate in the information on &amp; quant@@ um ; to navigate , to open and to ro@@ am . in the display with card holders stand for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation of building views .
project Management is a powerful tool , which provides &amp; quantitative information ; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project via the right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all options open to you .
templates can be classified into three categories , depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects . more to templates is in place .
here you find information on the available script@@ ing languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the information available to a script . through the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send by email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the Element@@ um . by right click an element opens a list of commands concerning navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree prospects . with it one can change some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the content @-@ related application system allows changing all of the available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for Web @-@ technology for your development . you can create documentation for &amp; quant@@ um ; of the quant@@ um , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; two cases at the bottom of the window that can be achieved using the us@@ eless information : the message window and the problem window .
this cardboard box shows information on any current script in quantity . such as the current DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this cardboard box shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ um , execute all error messages ( such as it gives in this window ) .
the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define its own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ um .
another feature of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email ; and when they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can be able to secure it into &amp; qu@@ anti@@ de ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has made a number of options to get to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here .
if you have problems when starting up &amp; quant@@ um , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 I folders . you should also make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ um lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ um lus was optimized for rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ um , started to deal with an obvious mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it perfectly the most treas@@ ured web development tools for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; is limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now , already on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; quant@@ um , then should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above @-@ mentioned requirement has to be noted that &amp; quant@@ um ; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; - odo@@ urs is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; quantitative Analytics ; allows to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can improve productivity almost every task . by the program Com@@ pre@@ macy , it can be expanded , without any script@@ ing language syntax . ( more you can find them in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; quant@@ a ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more information in detail is with help : / quant@@ a ( either type this URL into &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ centre help : / quant@@ a ) .
&amp; is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ encer @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick @-@ access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not found on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . should you try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project unit folder , only a bug is reported .
converted when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ sp@@ elling , so it does not display correctly and are not understood by browser as form@@ atting .
convert the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; it is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are available !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the window window or not . this is the window , where you can see the viewing of script@@ ing and de@@ bu@@ gger .
trigger and Swit@@ ching of the problem rep@@ orters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ; the main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated , once you change to the structural tree .
displays the symbol column left from the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when there is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries predict@@ able or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
a existing project of the hard disk . &amp; quant@@ um , -@@ projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory after new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folders or sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project .
invites the files to your project high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings such as &amp; quantitative lus ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; quantitative Analytics ; - Projects expl@@ aining the details .
downloads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by default actions . tool bar must be saved through tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool@@ bar from the range of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you still haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
in order to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; quant@@ um , -@@ Team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item will open a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where any other one can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you have made or anything else and convert to the &amp; quant@@ um of the &amp; quant@@ um .
loading / Rel@@ ax@@ ing of entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be changed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is globally and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , the store will fail .
this menu includes a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is available , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent entries of tags . currently , this does only work with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; quant@@ um ; the paste is denied by the tool bar if this day is contra@@ dic@@ ated to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins in the menu are listed below . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in .
choose the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available haz@@ ard schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ates ; -@@ version .
select the type of line identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to the development . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D document ; using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
instant change between the different types of user interface . through some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can cause time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default mode , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the presentation in &amp; quant@@ um , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open window . with selecting a single application the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
indicating the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main window to or out .
the changes in this dialog affects any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the Edit@@ or@@ window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate , you can find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add or add sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the maus@@ oleum , but it is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative product ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ake ; -@@ Development in financial form , please find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the best of the project named after completing the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Tab .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ um lus project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( eg f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , one , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
once you use this field , the default log settings will be used . depending on the remote computer setting , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows files to include files from the local file system to the project . several files or folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you want to download and modify the static web content you want to download and change . in case @-@ sided scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
note , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included . if a project is started ane@@ w , not an@@ ha@@ ze .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection for good th@@ inner .
this displays a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ ha@@ ken or , by removing the check@@ box , clips from the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu area or with the key symbol shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some of the settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are re@@ written in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
in supple@@ mentary option to the above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views .
the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed is being used . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in can be selected using the Options tab . in this , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a server view for each profile , representing an own custom view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window managers , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as mailing list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration you can turn event actions and add these actions , change or delete any actions . event actions will be executed if a previously defined event occurs , as the f@@ ender of a file . see in the details .
by default &amp; quant@@ um lus , the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at the moment .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol Open from the tool bar . the Open Project will be shown and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ um , it will be saved , the project file will be saved automatically if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; quant@@ um ; changed files . the same happens when you invite a new project .
the project manager provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders also be@@ have , however , the entries opening and opening ... in the context of the right mouse pop @-@ up menu :
various profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information on the site of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is only more a profile , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forget on program@@ ing . this possibility is useful if common up@@ loading files is needed and the rather in@@ secure password on the plate does not come in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ um , many high load profiles and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service to the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple di@@ pping of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened or deleted by tool@@ bar within the menu or project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ um , with which one has to do most . this does not only improve productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative ; to its own work@@ ings .
as mentioned above , tool bar in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; best accessible via the menu bar . use and adding them . adding tool bar is treated below in the added tool@@ bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either by the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which you can set different actions such as tool bar , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions will be shown on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries action will be removed and the action are displayed , which are self explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions on them can set up settings in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings to set .
templates are in key documentation , code car@@ vings and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates to link existing files with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or use each at the system existing in the storage room . templates have in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ ap@@ lus in about the limitations , which one imag@@ ines to the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quantitative reports ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries are normally inserted into documents using links ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . more information about templates is available .
documents can be created from any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple framework for the purpose and organiz@@ es work in an appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found under global templates . see for more information about templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system on Javascript and per@@ l basis . some examples are listed under global templates . see for more information about templates .
as the name says , these templates are used for whole web sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative .
create a document structure according to your will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File When presentation Save As Local template ....
once this is done , note that ( even if it is saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the repository . watch under the repository .
select text in your document and click File As a template to save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and laying on the tree view templates .
binary templates is simple : the file is only used in a template folder . it can be used to execute all the file management functions , such as pulling and inser@@ tion or insert on the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files to select a folder , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very purpos@@ eful procedure . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; in addition you can add some things to using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the lower window template is based on the files specified in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ a / Templ@@ ates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ a / Templ@@ ates / share templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as described above .
to specify the behavior of a folder is in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder , and select the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this option is low as soon as ter@@ restri@@ al attributes can be scanned .
this is enabled by default and fits all except for the main folders in the system table . if a master folder would be set off , it would explicitly appear in this path . if nothing appears , the B@@ lah would appear with something like text construction . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder .
allows forward or presented text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and enables copying of contents in a folder with special header lines / foot@@ er a whole presentation already fitted with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show that right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from a place to another .
&amp; quant@@ um , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor , which are accessible via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second split the editor window in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and edit your code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ler of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor is still necessary to change this behavior . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode is just like the first , except that the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is visible and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , if the keyboard is shifted from a window to another , whereby the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via settings Quant@@ a .... In case you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatic . in principle , the recommendation can be set automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow PCs .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tool documentation is possible . therefore , the editing of invisible tags is also possible , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the editor is created . this can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pushing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows changing the contents , e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key wor@@ d@@ 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to create pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as with the Meta @-@ Elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing the file open button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is as usual in a text process , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves like usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by R@@ Ü@@ CK@@ TA@@ ST@@ E or removed .
adding tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bars as in the source code editor . it is to be aware that the inser@@ tion of tags is already existing already existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for testing sty@@ list@@ eners . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feeding , the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the breast@@ plate can be prosec@@ uted .
to be able to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; you need lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available for a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; they are already available .

there are many graphical tools for the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ing had changed many changes and at the same time had changed a lot of changes at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of changes in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging .
the program used by me was only showing me the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the reverse was changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent the differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , lots of further useful functions have been added later .
if you would like to compare text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and add it to one of the compar@@ ative windows .
a function made a lot of work was the compar@@ ative and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned into mut@@ ated &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge operation is also fully supported . this is useful if two people are able to work independently of one piece of co@@ ils and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to solve the result . in this editor you can even process the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen photo shows three source files at the merge command :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also like the same and merge complete file . this screen saver features &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folders :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and look similar to the possibilities of today color monitors . if you often need to check Ko@@ en , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no worry if no one changes the shift . )
when a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color indicates that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can ease your ti@@ pp@@ work by typ@@ ing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
diff@@ use folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder
the opening dialog allows manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will be displayed again . if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder , if you select a folder , if you select a folder , for B and C , a folder will be used for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ges are crossed , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file , even later in store .
the setup process opens up a dialog with settings . here you can set options before using the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can easily connect the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use pulling and dismant@@ ling : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes contains a file for example several similar functions . if you want to figure out how much the functions are , they would have to compare two appropriate files , to copy them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can easily copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only to remove text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and inser@@ tion of text into another program as cut@@ ters and inser@@ tions ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such cases , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source window is the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional , then leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are associated with letters A , B and C . a color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these prefer@@ ences may be changed over the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one sees in the color , which is different . if both files differ is the default color for it is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good .
left next to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . with some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , relevant to the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare instances . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column of the text , is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison chart ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ wand@@ s &#93; if you already have the outcome . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ b@@ anded , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use buttons to find next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons can be used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also be the first line in the windows . ) this group will be highlighted in the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes it is left through automatic merge or manual editing no more line longer in the group ; then this is only a wild@@ card for the case that you may change your mind , and perhaps a different source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; M@@ erg@@ einf@@ o conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy this text from the result window . carefully go to this function .
note : when selecting the sources select numbers , ignore or ignore options C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the image and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can also use the arrow keys left , right , end , Str@@ g @-@ Beg@@ inning and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w how you can also use it from other programs . the saf@@ est column next to the vertical panel bar can also be used by entering the navigation bar .
in the window window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and writ@@ able mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the coll@@ ision columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the section and explained the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool@@ bar includes seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture Down ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture Down ) or for the next / previous conflict . therefore , between solved and un@@ solved conflicts can be distinguished .
to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you will need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this is enabled , you will also automatically copy the clip@@ board . be careful with this option but be careful because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ ing are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ in @-@ line \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car revers@@ al + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ for@@ ge \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the lash@@ ing of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start . ( menu In@@ stell@@ un@@ gen@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a type@@ face with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog is used with variable wid@@ ths to choose from , but you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font is not supported , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be shown . on these systems , the button will automatically create an un@@ locked color .
when this option is enabled , the tab@@ ulator button will insert the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator @-@ sign will be inserted .
if you press entering or return , the recovery of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy the clip@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ up type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used option on the operating system used .
when compar@@ ing files are tried &amp; diff@@ use ; first , all identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step is not ignored every line . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . white characters won &apos;t be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back sign &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; however , if this option is enabled , the wagon covers are visible , but if this option is activated , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
the default value is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
the auto @-@ skip mode determines this setting , as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is going to continue .
trig@@ gers automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you are able to ignore all the functions in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in chapter to scan folders and flow of interaction . check for details under documentation of the folder comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already there is such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original file , it will be deleted without any further backup .
does not fit the interface language . changing this option does not concern the current running program . you need to quit and re @-@ launch it . ( this option is active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is currently used globally via the control center . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activated this option , the upper settings will be used for all entries .
over the drop @-@ fields for encoding appears a brief reference , which is the local codi@@ fication . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
custom@@ ize the file code for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which codi@@ fication should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you may not need to work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unicode . ) With this option , you can define the coding of the output command commands .
turn off this down to supp@@ ress any changes in white characters in the text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two of three files . but sometimes you want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is still a second , saf@@ est column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
if the comparison window is adjacent to each other , it can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge command and uses the file name of the last source file as default for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot the merge , then the name of the last used file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will be given first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which equ@@ ates to your own requirements . you can use this function , for example , to remove bo@@ ther parts or to correct the re@@ tention .
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command , then the output of the command is used only when using this command processor . the output of the command is used only when it matches your own requirements . each input line must have an associated entry line .
the idea behind is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it . however , good news is , however , that in most cases it will suff@@ ice or per@@ l perfectly sufficient .
please use this pre @-@ processing command for line parts to change the input in upper@@ case : S@@ ed &apos;s / \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; in one line . the \ \ U lists the found text in the first plain text . the \ \ U converts the found text in capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ st@@ itution ) . all follow the same pattern $ Key@@ word product \ &apos; s / \ &apos; \ &apos; \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \
while you experiment with S@@ ed , you might start to understand it and maybe like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignorance of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example for another pre@@ fabri@@ cation command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ sent@@ . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and every match is replaced by nothing , so virtually er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple translations at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the needs of each other . example :
instead of used , you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; Ho@@ wever , per@@ l some details differently . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and to merge . further operations just change the data that the Z@@ eil@@ le @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the cell @-@ off pre@@ processor looks the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the lyrics changes or differences , you acci@@ dentally don &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal from the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and show the sim@@ ulated changes , without having to perform it ,
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the default and mer@@ ging of single files . you just have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the merge . to start the merge button , select the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . )
during the reading of the folder , you will find a small news window over current progress . if you susp@@ end the folder , only the files are listed until then .
if the scanning of the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and any folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click .
the folder structure is usually folded together , by clicking on the + / - click on the line or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
if you double click on a file , the file will be started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation can not be selected automatically . if mer@@ ging is started , you will be informed by problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , in columns A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
ste@@ wards are considered to be identical if you are all identical content . then , folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its colour .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green then yellow and later when it is old , red will be red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such faul@@ ts exist , the merge can not be started .
... A and B cannot have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such faul@@ ts exist , the merge can not be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder have been specified and if the option is synchron@@ ised and then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B do exist but not identical : together and save the result in both folders . ( the user will see the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; de@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New files are activated , then exam@@ ines &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the same date . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merge can &apos;t be launched .
during the merge , a file after the other operates . it status column indicates that when the mer@@ ging was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages , if something unexpected is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is everywhere in order .
when the setup dialog has chosen fully @-@ constant analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only appear if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can merge either the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have not specified the target folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode C , the two @-@ folder merge will be used as target and for synchron@@ izing is A and / or B as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are to be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure , there are some options to be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to bring together all entries : select directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ note sign ) . to run only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears on the faulty elements . you can select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options running , stim@@ ulate and breaking .
select Sim@@ ulate when you only want to see what would happen without the really changes done . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( see the screenshot one ) .
when you are ready with a file , select again directory together / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you still haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , you will see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that you should try to skip the cause of the problem or to resolve the problem of the problem or to solve the problem in any way before you continue with the result .
if some entries were compiled individually , these entries are noted ( in the current session ) and results in later stages of all entries . even if the merge changes have been taken up or not saved , these entries will change as performed . only if you change the merge action , these entries are collected again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern , are displayed in the element tree . separate wild@@ card with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many authors generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be folder specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a default attribute . this option allows you to decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links will show . this is disabled in the default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared to . if the option is switched on , the links are treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that the link does not include a link to itself . ) This option is shut down in the default .
results in full analysis of any file by and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when used to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding Anti @-@ Pat@@ tern )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the date of change and the file size . however , this option is limited to caution . please use caution when default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to , e.g. when copying the chan@@ ges@@ date . please use caution when copying the chan@@ ges@@ date . this option is def@@ aults to default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was selected . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are selected . also , the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is shut off in both folders .
if there are differences will be suggested instead of mer@@ ging the newer file as action . ( this will be considered in@@ secure , because the other file is not altered as well . you should check this in any case . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ original If an old backup file is already existing , this will also affect the normal interaction of individual files , not only the merge to all folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge operation always remains visible to the merge single files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the window lists in the window menu and switch between the two opinions between the two opinions .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , in the directory menu , you can also use a single file directly , so you can use the current file to run it , and the file will not run once again , and the file will not run again if you run the folder .
this status is , however , lost when you read the directory : read here : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively t@@ und@@ . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space mark &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link is displayed on a file or a folder . then there will always be a file as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no way to process author@@ iz@@ ations or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date are removed from the original . ( note this option only if possible . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main objective is currently available as the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op always starts the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . to start with K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then choose In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ part view from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the input file needs to exist in the Unix file . at least one of the files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ reducing 3@@ Part . please note that it doesn &apos;t work if there is none of the original files . besides , it is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since generating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ ist com@@ bs ) are already available . moreover , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs very long and I have learned a lot by learning in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers that have gone out or going to go .
you have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script for the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find detailed information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white characters is different , the line is not treated as identical . i@@ F ho@@ lines the next to teach other , this is co@@ des@@ patch this bl@@ is O@@ FT@@ EN the case .
the editor appears for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to create a conflict easily by clicking in the source code and selecting the button if the result is simple as a text file , and it is too much effort to design extra a private file format that could store this information .
the effort was so far too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; no sr@@ c left ; and the text cannot be removed . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and lack the purpose . please use another editor for that .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the function updated . )
there are only entries to display the differences . this also leads to that identical files are not already being copied to the target folder . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are missing in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons on select the source with lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly .
default , this option is disabled . Under@@ sho@@ ots in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
der &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work spaces . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the working areas to stop them or move it . this works both within a desktop and for several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as those in running applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle bar button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click , the context menu will only be clicked on the application and the name of the application and the entries minimum , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and Finish . the commands are following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of desktop . only appears when clicked on an application .
it sends the application to select virtual desktop . only appears when clicked on an application .

if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ amp ; otherwise , only the empty space areas will be shown to make their selection .
here is the view of the program window . icon displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the display functions of the program window . icon displays the window with its standard icon and pixel shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .

&amp; Qu@@ be ; is a very powerful application that constantly extends to new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you may start , a window appears as pictured above . the main window of the screen appears . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window . the image that is shown in the magni@@ fication window is a larger area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; can be magni@@ fied ; the area around the cur@@ sor as a moving tray . alternatively , you can have a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse line on the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , select the default cur@@ sor position . please note that the mouse cur@@ sor is able to see the form of the mouse line . this is still not able to see the form of the mouse line ; this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse po@@ inter .
in select mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can shift it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlar@@ ging window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fication window and move it . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press or use the M@@ MB ; move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; I like ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy the image to insert it later ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
/ or stops the updating of the display . stopping the update process causes the needed CPU time to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , medium , high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&amp; may ; automatically uses your set commands to store files , opening a new window , print , ne@@ c@@ ades ( with the button document again in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Ver@@ less@@ er &amp; etc ; .
may also be known as &amp; k@@ glu@@ fier ; it is a screenshot of the screen . you can use a magni@@ fier ; it is used to use a micro@@ bar in order to use the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is suitable for different people of use : from search engine or artist to web designer or cra@@ ft@@ able .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor takes a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( repet@@ itive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and each mouse hit pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor causes pain in the same place . it is meant to help people who can em@@ ulate pain at the repet@@ itive strain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the mouse with the mouse . this requires a bit of exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can cope with pain while clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , suffer from pain associated with your computer . if you &apos;re looking for a doctor if this is not done .
to make it even clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to arise when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the desire of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic ai@@ ds , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click when you stop the movement briefly .
is the intelligent d@@ ump@@ ing enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it is executed by pushing the mouse button . in this way , you can run the drag by pressing the mouse button . it requires a bit of exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this dist@@ ortion period must be stopped after the end of the maus@@ oleum before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the turning time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after supp@@ ress the mouse button is waiting , before there is no desire for the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , followed by a break , followed by a break , followed by a break , a slow move , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to make the reaction time to sh@@ orten it , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the Sound System and here the rider General . there is a slide sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation to determine how you start a program automatically .
sets all settings back to the values when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button applic@@ ant , the settings are reset to the level after the last hit by users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially use the prefer@@ ences . in particular the intelligent d@@ ump@@ tions you should initially be used at first . if you then click the automatic mouse , you can later take the smart shift .
if you use the audible click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first of all , you should make a mouse click on which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window does not have a link . you can park your mouse on such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse is ru@@ ined , you should clean your mouse . this is usually fairly simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first of all , you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
when you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are placed on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the so@@ iling can be easily scratch with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are just started an im@@ min@@ ent , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by the release of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; move under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . this is reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you input text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse click and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to have it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you are looking for a neutral mouse click . safe zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey surfaces around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shift , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text .
the intelligent d@@ ump@@ ing is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time to copy it , to copy it to the clip@@ board or move it again . but it will probably only prepare problems with you . here are some advice :
do not use smart shifts if you just start working &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . select text instead as follows : execute the Shift key instead , while you move the mouse cur@@ sor over the other end of the text , and once again enter the mouse button .
so use the audible mouse click . this way , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the smart shift begins . later , you can use smart shifts without the audible mouse click . but it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be the case on most systems already .
the functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are properly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activated the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor is short . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and to which the actu@@ ating of the cre@@ st pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to configure a certain period of time , that a pulling process begins to release before the mouse button will release . in this way , pulling and playback can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the dum@@ b user can speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , mu@@ te users can speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of phrases which should be spoken once again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screenshot ) give the command to be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup .
on the second page you choose the standard text @-@ fitting document . you can often choose text pass@@ ers , without requiring typ@@ ing . the text pass@@ ers can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( ri@@ ght@@ ful screenshot ) you specify the dictionary for the choice of words . in addition , you read the pron@@ unci@@ ation of the individual words . in addition , you can retri@@ eve the words of individual words . in addition , you can read the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly stab@@ bing words are included in the words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains basically a input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white box in screenshot ) and a run @-@ time of the already spoken sentences ( the top white box in screenshot ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the phrases which you want to hear . any spoken proposition is attached to the disk space . you can select from it sets that should be spoken once again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ nal , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the voice card , you specify the command to call the voice generator . in the drop box below the field command you specify the character encoding , with the text is passed to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . choose the check box if the text will be distributed as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , text is passed as parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the order will depend on your language generator . in this command you will find in the documentation on your language generator . examples are given in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if you want to use as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to continue the text for the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , further settings are developed for voice output , and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N ; the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
when selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text pass@@ agen@@ buch , or in the case for text pass@@ books .
with the selection of immediate words , the selected text passage will be spoken directly and additionally inserted into the box memory . with the selection of in the input field , the chosen text passage is only entered in the input field .
with the second drop down of the edit box , you can specify whether the text @-@ fitting notebook is to be saved automatically when closing the edit window .
with the selection of text pass@@ agen@@ buch , the book is stored . if you choose changes , the text pass@@ agen@@ buch is not saved . dial before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ agen@@ buch is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ination Site contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the ad@@ dic@@ ation . in the main window , next to the entry field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop box in which this list contains more than a dictionary . with this drop @-@ down dictionary , you can select the currently used dictionary .
with buttons on the right side you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list , you can adjust the name and select language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the refund . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to include only correctly written words in the new dictionary .
using this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries should be merged .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re@@ pressed words into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window to the processing of text pass@@ ers is divided . in the upper part , the text pass@@ boards are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key@@ note . if you have selected a text @-@ fitting document , you can change only its name .
actions such as new passages or books add or delete books or books you can either reach the menu bar in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or over a folding menu .
the order of text pass@@ boards or text pass@@ ers can be changed by pulling the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the chosen text will be cut and copied to the clip@@ board . if the input field is selected a text section is used , otherwise the selected areas of the memory cache is used .
the chosen text is copied to the clip@@ board . if the input field is selected a text section is used , otherwise the selected areas of the memory cache is used .
the currently active movement is spoken . if text is in an input field , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected sets of the memory cache .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow glue in the bottom part of the main window with notes over the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable rim for text pass@@ boards with entries is displayed directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the ch@@ art@@ ed left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output , or not fully typ@@ ed . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up , open the page General Settings and specify the command for voice speech on the voice card . ( see Settings dialog for Language Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a voice program of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and further spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the file / us@@ r / local / festival . the order for voice command is then :
Free@@ TTS is a language generator established in &amp; Java . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS for free and no restrictions on any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the setup of voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the file / us@@ r / local / fre@@ et . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the Free@@ TTS application . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ eme into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to em@@ it the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA is installed in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ lo@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swallowed up the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more elab@@ orate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / her@@ ro@@ la / s@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / s@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ r / local / mb@@ lo@@ la / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the input data must be switched on as standard input .
the voice of voice dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; - continued language service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being used in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the speech@@ es only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you will only have to use the arbit@@ r@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ;
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service that appears in the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ not ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 Mb of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) but depends on the detail of your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t talk with people who cannot say text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences can be saved , which the user can re@@ produce again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language value added . the calcul@@ ator must be installed on the computer .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ops ; in the k@@ de Acc@@ essibility mailing list . here you can find the list via htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ boxes / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility . the developers can also find at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you can use &amp; read , you must install the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly .
after the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are set up , the card box will be shown . see also . if you have a minimum of speakers , the card card will be displayed .
most TTS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that are in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard driver .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple printers for the same printer .
if you click on the card card champion in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card box will appear . this will appear automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no speakers is established .
all featured speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the first speaker is used for voice output if any application does not exist .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker on the list a line further down . the sequence of speakers in the list determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ System .
choose a voice type here , three male and three female voices , as well as a boy and girl agree on the selection .
when you click here , the new spokes@@ man will appear on the card box . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can already use it . go back to the card card , so that the TTS Service starts by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ on ; then click on the map card to create and manage text jobs . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can launch the language system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card card leader to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box in order to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this is successful start with the K@@ DE TTS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . is this start successfully , and you can make text jobs and read off . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and download the TTS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when ct@@ t@@ sm@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ on ; further , if the field voice is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ on appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the procedure is complete .
with buttons in this row , you can start text jobs , stop , stop and record again .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ clip@@ board , or open a text file to preview . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be adopted on all sides .
the card card orders will only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card card leader , and cross the voice card ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , you can then read the text which is read before , and select your lyrics in the main menu Tools text . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ Vor@@ spann@@ er and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed before . then check first if you read the text , which should be read , and select the main menu Tools text . then the voice output should begin .
this works even if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ a ;
K@@ Not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; , which you informed about you specified events . you can read the text of this messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read on .
in &amp; conversation ; you can set up a message from the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can see different types of messages , for example , that you can see a message in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ on , you can then read the IR@@ C news code .

filters for drawing support offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ on ; in@@ correctly stressed or incorrect to correct messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml which is delivered to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that can be accepted in most cases as required . read it too .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ on ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters do not require filters .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations , a matching language and voice to handle certain defects of language syn@@ thesizer and their voices .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program works &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; with a text . &amp; kt@@ on ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen Saver has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these assign@@ ments . if the output of the screen reader is read , the received orders will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and regular text . these orders will continue after the warning of the warning .
News have the next amount of messages . a message inter@@ ru@@ pts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . while you are looking for a long text on a web page , you can also enter the room . &amp; k@@ mouth ; al@@ erts are also messages . read it too .
the rest are simple text jobs . each order that you use by the card card is a text job . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text jobs . text jobs are intended for the edition longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen Re@@ aders . if any application sends the output of a screen @-@ reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such message is reading , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters can never be applied to the output of Screen Saver . they are used for normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter process the text and give it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the replacement parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ats ; used by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ forms use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from a format to another format . in scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ats ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML format .
with speaking selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of text or depending on the program , which has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ on ; if you have submitted a female voice for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it .
each of these different filters is adjustable , after which it is applied for a voice output . if the filter indicates that its rules does not apply , he gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text job , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ ification of &amp; kt@@ ats ; sent to them by all activated filters , which were set up on the page below . editing through the filter occurs in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this displays the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not checked and is not used . filter will follow the range upward down@@ wards .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be displayed on the following setup dial@@ ogs .
please enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison pattern . these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be replaced with the appropriate replacement . large and small nar@@ rative is not considered by comparison .
type a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you want . it just needs to differ from names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replace it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place by . the list is handled in the order shown above down@@ wards .
click here to shift the marked word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load or delete a list of words or regular expres@@ sions of a file , save the current list or delete a list from a file , entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker for the text job is one of the languages registered here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , K@@ mail
you can get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers have to be om@@ itted for example . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID head @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be set .
the string hook script will only apply to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box di@@ esen filter . if all input fields are blank , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the batch replacement filter uses regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s word . so words must be limited by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this guide you can find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can find it in dial@@ ogs Add or edit as help to merge these expres@@ sions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls package .

enter the path to x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
for example , you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up on the card box , or on a speaker with certain properties . you can define for example that texts by K@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before making a text to the filter , it searches a speaker for the text . the speaker is presented on the subject of the speaker , which gives the text to &amp; kt@@ on ; sends , and the characteristics of the speakers submitted by the speaker card . with the speaker optional speaker you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if the text is entered here , the filter is applied , if the text has the entered regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can enter it with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster workmanship , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you specify the properties of the required microphone . if the text fills the above shown filter conditions , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements . click on the button right to display the dialog box selection .

the speech output API , von &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer may give their applications TTS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers add to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ on can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re@@ formed filters , but not read by using the module for the festival .
due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ ode to do it even if you do not need to use this voice to read web pages . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just che@@ wing worlds . what can I do against it ?
first make sure that the option set character encoding is set to the correct level . there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string hook @-@ up filter . see .

the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want &amp; read , use the development team in connection with the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from the source code for k@@ acc@@ acc@@ essibility or download all night @-@ created tar@@ ball , translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language controls . to do so , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ats ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the device of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text will be de@@ composed into single sentences . the user can re@@ vo@@ ke sat@@ z@@ - or dec@@ ember , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
if any application text can be submitted to &amp; kt@@ on ; for example , you can request the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have a speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be automatically elected the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ on ; a speaker will be selected .
for example , if you click on the map speaker on Add , and to edit a speaker on the list or click Edit button , the card box is shown in the following . as an example , the module setup will be shown in the module for details of the modules .
enter the path to the executable festival program . if the path to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you only have to type festival .
choose the character encoding for text , which will be delivered to the festival . in general , this setting will be made automatically . in general , they will use Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak . ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these shooting test , adjust the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t choose some kno@@ b , and this grey can be displayed , the voice of your chosen voice will not be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you load this check box , these voices will already be loaded when the first set is faster than the first set is faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have a speaker ( or forget to click on the user ) .
if this check box is marked , the program window is displayed in the system window , but not the program window is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ on is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the ability to read or otherwise control .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card box .
with buttons in this range , you can be on behalf in the order that is selected in the list below , before or back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( even on the other cards ) will be taken on the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card . see also .
here only text jobs are listed and managed . expenses of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . further information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ on ; either compiled without support for corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ops ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select an audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to have at least one module . have you choose the PC@@ M device here . see also
put the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % are about double normal microphone speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed SO@@ x .
click Apply to Apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this map , you can set special actions , which will always be executed when the text job is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ on ; processes four types of speech :
the output of Screen Saver has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and re@@ tains these assign@@ ments . after the output of the screen reader was read , the received orders will be resumed .
War@@ nings is a priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning will keep the output of news and regular text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ ru@@ pts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you are &amp; eg ; just to welcome a long text on a web page , you can still get someone who enters the room .
if a text job is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen @-@ reader , add &amp; kt@@ on ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
the audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sounds are active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special promotions for messages , al@@ erts and expenses of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders , if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; t ; K@@ Not@@ ify messages , start @-@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card not@@ ifications will appear .
select this check@@ box to turn the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ ification cannot be selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no notification .
if this setting is marked , not@@ ifications for which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ats ; not read before .
use these buttons to add events to the list or click it . if you click on button Add , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops ;
use this drop down area to determine what &amp; t ; if an event arrives . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter here the characteristics of the requested speaker . standard elec@@ ts the speaker that is shown in the list on the card box as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if a particular event is specified for any particular application , the action will be executed for any other events of the particular application . otherwise , the action will be specified for any other events of the particular application . otherwise , the action will be specified for carrying all other events specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All not@@ ifications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can specify the default messages as follows :
use the button Save to save the settings in a file to store the settings stored in a file . if you want to start using an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all notification will be deleted .
the speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice output , the speech speed , volume of speech and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of the pron@@ unci@@ ation of for example ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ats ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , which is used in the SS@@ ML edition .
if the settings for speed or sound conditions at the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is adjusted , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; htt@@ p : / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .@@ dt@@ d . who slept in my bed ? asked Mama Bear . who was sleeping in my bed ? &#91; ... &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . this can also start reading or cancel the entire text contract , as only the first sentence has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text contract . thus , you can also stop or stop or stop , even if the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers do not support this directly .
here you can see the Sat@@ z@@ est recognis@@ able filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ on it is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add another sat@@ z@@ est @-@ recognition filter , but beginner is not recommended .
the easiest way to learn the installation of the speaking selection by trying . turn the microphone selection again and specify some features and check out how the speaker &apos;s selection has changed . of course you have to have set up more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ on ; then , faster with the pre @-@ reading can begin , as only the first set must be processed and not all text block , which can last very long ,
they can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers do not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ limit filter will be set automatically when you start typ@@ ing sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed , just change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
typ@@ ing filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ular ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the typ@@ ist limits ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the typ@@ ist ( automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard proposition filter provides the string .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ man ) , warnings , news or the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have a look from the normal set @-@ limit filter , you can re @-@ paste it by using the default _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c standard .
on the map selection menu you can write the microphone settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
using the default word ( the top on the card box ) . with other words , no speech characteristics are specified .
use of the most suitable microphone , which has all properties of a furnished speaker . if you don &apos;t delete or edit the user &apos;s settings ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise elec@@ ts &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise elec@@ ts &amp; kt@@ ops , who originally set the properties .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
choose the properties of the requested speaker . if this property doesn &apos;t play any role , don &apos;t give anything .
select this check@@ box if the property should have priority over other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue is , it is always used as a prime property . you might want to use this property if you possibly know that a specific application is provided in another language as in the working environment .
to delete all properties in the field of speakers , which is closest to the following , click on the select button standard speakers and then apply to speakers who are closest to the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text job in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and &amp; kt@@ ops ; probably you must register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x . if the problem is not resolved it is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install a G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application music . if I start a text job , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message on the &amp; console ; appears : the open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem that conflicts at AL@@ SA will occur , which will prevent the same time opening of several PC@@ M devices . references for possible solutions will be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ Mas@@ t@@ .org .
I have downloaded another Voice for Festival from the Internet . I installed it and can not use them at festivals , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / sec@@ ts / Vo@@ ices , add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice to the developer .
on the card card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be installed instant and over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive can also offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this function is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ reading . ( this is your own tag , which is controlled by the speed . ) De@@ activate the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ shaping filter , and set up the microphone speed up .
I don &apos;t make that web pages have been read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ on ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . so the X@@ SL @-@ file throws no mistakes in converting SS@@ ML to SA@@ BER the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own animation filter copy and now I can go into &amp; kt@@ on ; on the box office , orders will be displayed only from one proposition . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation mark ( point , question marks , fire sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not fil@@ tering . use a filter for pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition instead .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA &apos;s conflicts at the audio output . if your system also counts as well , you can &apos;t start playing music and start reading a text when you start a text job and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still supports no real breaks . if you hold a text job in &amp; kt@@ on , the current set will still be read .
the audio program So@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the microphone speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install So@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs are already included .

Festival is one of the best free TTS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops ;
you need to install at least one language . help you to read in the tut@@ orials , which are delivered with Festival . want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ ode .
for these voices , you must comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the sour@@ c@@ ec@@ ode of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions .
this voice continues Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stages stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to set up the voices at ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ ode . select a C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 bit@@ - ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions for distribution as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for instance KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .

this manual describes the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows to manage the network interfaces , the routing and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Centre ; can be called by selecting from K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to provide the administration of TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the user with the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displays the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t need to install and configured it , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed with install and set up . network units are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings will be loaded when the network settings will be selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; - Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , the platform used to detect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform is not recognized , the hands will be offered out of the list , which is best to choose from the list and the release date . by marking the setting non @-@ again questions can set the definition permanently . in the next start of the network settings , then this selection will be set automatically .
the change of the network settings is possible only in system administration mode . in advance , all options are displayed grey , which means the settings can only be considered . in the system administration mode , you can click on the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
in the system administration mode , the whole functionality of the module is available . these are divided into three men :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
setting @-@ up network interfaces can set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box can be processed .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click for the dialog with further options .
with the selection of Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further settings are required . in the list box , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , will be selected according to the system .
with the selection manually , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration must be done . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be fixed .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization does not wish to be checked , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the box list .
it should be ensured that the IP address of the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the required network device , by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specifies the IP address of the computer in the local network , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ net .
if there is more than a network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain parameter by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the machine htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator &apos;s name for nam@@ esp@@ ace part of the e@@ quest@@ rian nam@@ esp@@ ace allows an easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be added by selecting a single request and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons .
by clicking the button Add ... from the batch calcul@@ ator for nam@@ esp@@ ace , a DNS server can be added . it will add the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server , then click the button Add . the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator for nam@@ esp@@ ace , select an entry and then click the Edit Edit .... It will display the Edit Edit .
the list of well known calcul@@ ator describes the machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting , if no DNS server can be available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually , the list includes well @-@ known computers several entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this is still in the final version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... The New API dialog box is indicated .
enter the name of the well known host name and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias name , add button Add several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known host from the list and select Edit .... the dialog box is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in Module settings are not immediately available in the system . in order to activate the changes , it must be removed in a &amp; console ; the following command must be removed .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distribution ( usually rpm packages ) is enough , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s simply the rpm package to download and in a &amp; console ; using rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with a graphic interface , such as k@@ package or install tool can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; but additionally , the development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should accomplish this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given in the second , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed .
this area cannot substitute any further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC are medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 never has big spread . from IPv6 it is expected that it is now concentrated in the near future . this description is based on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the know@@ led@@ geable IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator address the contact address , which can be used as DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when placing an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially designed area to avoid IP address conflicts using the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are mostly used in the range from 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the power mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the network address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , there are the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified in DSL connections , so it is not surprising if in the case of active DSL connections another content is specified there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file will be sorted by scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ ony . another stand as expected may occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was the respon@@ ding to a question for quick , sel@@ ective un@@ packing . the second goal was the respon@@ ding to a question that my wife ordered : how much longer does it take if you sec@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it has to be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the tape on the tape will not be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the spell check it searches for the right index on your record . cannot be found if the band index is to be created new .
everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the tape drive , in order to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the stat@@ us@@ bar there will be a corresponding message . the contents of the tape can now be searched by issu@@ ing the entry for the tape .
before throwing the band , first must be solved at first . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be recognized by a change of symbol for the band , that the binding for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the band can now be kicked out without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band cards must be format@@ ted before you have to be format@@ ted to store data . this process does not necessarily have to form@@ atting a band before using . floppy disk drives usually do form a form@@ atting of the tape ahead , DA@@ T drives on the other hand .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the band . all data on the tape are lost . after completing the form@@ atting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you push the backup process , you must select the secured files , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folders are secured .
select a profile profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in a local file tree with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree and select back in the menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog for backup is opened . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive . it will only be checked for selected file or folders .
select the files in one of the archives in entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are tested .
with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry check ....
once the test is started , the dialog settings dialog appears . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears to check this dialog . this dialog indicates the progress of the test process as well as data throughput and time periods .
before rele@@ asing the restore , the files must be restored , which will be restored . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the tape drive . it is only restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the so @-@ selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu .
once the re@@ creation process was launched , the dialog for Rest@@ oring . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for recovery .
when you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog indicates the progress of recovery , as well as data throughput and time periods .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ xed file based on the band &apos;s content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types from the band :
this is a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should be done . the list of saf@@ est files will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only those files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder that can be found on other file systems , you can apply separately using backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ circle backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine changes since the last in@@ circle backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; gt ; lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of preparation of this documentation .
the settings can set you up through the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path ben@@ ds to the non @-@ re@@ v variant of the band device .
is this setting active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is un@@ loading , it is necessary to load the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; put the dat ; this setting doesn &apos;t work on all drives .
if the option is switched on , the sol@@ dering of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically disc@@ ard the tape . use this option not with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ full block size for tape drives . not all drives support variable block@@ formats . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drives .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only take a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are compiled as follows :
( n Byte ) The Band ID . the format of this string is the machine name : seconds , where computer name is the complete name of the system , on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time has been format@@ ted in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the Band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archive , which can manage directly with &amp; GNU , tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not concerned about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup material . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer right for system logs . the program is intended for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows for the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems focusing on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your machine makes in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified ID of the protocol @-@ files of your own system . the program is intended for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system lays down the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information on the problems encounter@@ ing on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , some advanced functions are trying to work and analysed the protocol @-@ files certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screenshot one see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the various protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol will open , and it will not be displayed with system @-@ swal@@ ter@@ right . the protocol files are usually not included in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually does not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out the filter bar , so that only log messages can be displayed in the filter bar , so that only log messages can be displayed in the filter bar , so that only log messages can be displayed on the filter . then a protocol line is displayed only when in one of the columns contain the string of the Filter search engine .
you can also select another entry on this site . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and enter it in the filter bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors are displayed with a striking colour as protocol @-@ lines of the level . the colour display of protocol lines can be shut down dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example , in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example , if you want to investigate the output of a particular command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use the filter bar .
in addition , you can jump to the new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new lines of the coming Protocol .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage an additional window , select a log message in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has a dedicated website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V In@@ it system quickly develops into the standard for controlling the system start @-@ up system in the &amp; Linux ; hence , because it &apos;s easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go to historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without any re@@ installation and re @-@ format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service that you want to start at the system or when switching to another round level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it actually doesn &apos;t have much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something that has to do with the serial port .
the kernel searches at different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have a bit confused , then you will repair it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that no right files are in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
just like starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written that it is a argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will be called stop stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple kind of machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level , that only htt@@ pd , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; can also be run ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six rounds to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within one level by removing it elsewhere . this will only be done if it does not occur if you want to extract an entry from the field of dispos@@ ition .
note : entries will be postpon@@ ed if you move them into a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and even then , if the same entry has previously been in the target range of the promotion .
the sorting number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the bo@@ unding entries , before you can try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the different working ranges ( Available system services , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to hit a selection top or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change sorting number or the name of a single entry manually , press the button key to open the Properties button in order to accept the Properties button in order to accept the changes , or push Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of the data loss , all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . settings will be saved in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise , changes to the prefer@@ ences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard lap@@ tops , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have made some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting the run@@ level X , but they will not be executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual distribution .
the way , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , but does not simplify the configuration for the proprietary integration programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are needed ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) are simply without a message , if their configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual may be added .
this documentation relates to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made any changes you have to store this . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or record store in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user groups list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog User or Group Features .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have enabled users constra@@ ints ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will be created when Shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes .
the card card statement appears , if Shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears if you are activated and initi@@ alized for at least an integrated file system constra@@ int ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alize ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ as / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user parameters , whereby the number of space is in KB :
these parameters can be individually adjusted for each file system . the current file system is selected using space constra@@ int with the help of the fil@@ esystem .
the card groups informs about the assigned user of the selected user . the standard group that belongs to the user is in the field of Pri@@ m@@ alt@@ z . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting these in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user on the list .
to add a user or a group , choose from the menu user or group or click on the matching button of the tool@@ bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group is analog@@ ous .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO Boot@@ Manager to modify , remove and modify the time to bo@@ oting the standard operating system , to remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , modify and more .
