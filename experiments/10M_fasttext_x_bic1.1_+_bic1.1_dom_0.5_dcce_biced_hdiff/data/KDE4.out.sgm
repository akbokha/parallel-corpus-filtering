<seg id="1">You can translate the module website in & Conqueror; -Menu via Extras Website. select the output and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated to the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions depending on the translation, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated into the web. other texts should be translated into the Babelfish site yourself, where you can insert it to skip texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains different modules for & Conqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & Conqueror, by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & Conqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual, & Conqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & Conqueror; select Settings to set up, select the card tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the package kde; add-ons. please note that you might have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & Conqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & Conqueror; then you can view the page, the & Conqueror; for crash, or the list of crashes, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module (also called folder filters) can be found in the & Conqueror; menu bar with extras. with the module you can filter & Conqueror; 's current directory of work on different kinds.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree view inside & Conqueror; then select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM page. as default, the display is starting with the root notes of the document, example: documentelement, all other nodes are elements of this root nodes.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & fsview; for & Conqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text screens to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & fsview; consists of spinded folder archies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property, that the sum of sizes of subordinate objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">& fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries in it. consequently, large files can be recognized even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & fsview; as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview, an entry in the Treemap parameter is a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. to simplify navigation have the right colour view and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either be either a depth for the slight detection of the stress-depth or the figure of another file extension as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various features of the appropriate file or folder. if it is displayed at all, only if sufficient space is available for the display or if the surface is displayed by restrictions on the sign of the Treemap. moreover, you can specify the relative positions of the label in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of events for Treemaps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview; this frame will not always be followed. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As distribution of an entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation will leave. here it is necessary for the labelling and to avoid space losses through frame always advantageous that rectangles can arise, which are square. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns, or recursive second healing.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimized area for an entry via the menu entry. instead, a Rautenal pattern is drawn in the area of the overarched entry, in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an orderly entry.</seg>

<seg id="56">& digiplug. includes a quick image processing with basic training tools. you can view this to evaluate your photos, comment, evaluate and correct. editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plugins (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & standared; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional abilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the conversion by libraw, DNG-Export and ICC colours.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via camera or lens, via which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digiplug; an open source project. this means it is dependent on the support of end users. you should therefore report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digipsis; attempts to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in error report. all required information is already registered here. follow only the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digipist; is a project that is supported by a community. therefore, if you are a regular user of & digipist; then ask you to answer other users of & digial; and hopefully you can answer any other user questions. in this mailing list, you should be spoken in English, but you should be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digipack; homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about & digiplug; to be experienced.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digiplug, is the application in the developer mailing list. guide to report in the developer mailing list from & digipist;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you've got & digiplug; for the first time you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply type a local, remote or remote folders. enter the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your machine. this path is stored for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add so many folders as you'd like to add. & digiplug. will use additionally as Albensis as well.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the images you have. & digiplug; considered every subfolder as an album. no picture is changed. during the search of the folder you will see a progress indicator as these:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiplug; for recursively perform the library path in all its depth. you can't let down subfolders, unless it was in petrified folder. this you can insert aggerbs & digiplug as you insert a point in front of the folder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as basic folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist have no photos as symbols. you can change it by using any photo from the album, and this will then be used as an album icon. more details can be found in the Albums section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the Base folder, you can set up & digiplug. after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My Device box to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the blank mode of your camera, it may also handle tape; possibly, the support is based on the librav library. if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu of Rohkamerasupport.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh-workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy to use camera interface will be provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and get your photos directly in & digiplug. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library of photo2. of course, every media and every card reader is supported by your operating system will work with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are used by using Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera will then appear as a USB storage device (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras can also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; used the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras, which has a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras. GPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions on the serial port are slow. & digiplug. supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support, so that the EXIF support is not provided by some libgphoto2 camera drivers. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not spare any thumbnails or production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things of & digiplug, is how easy to expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plugins interface Project (manual) is a joint module structure for & digiplug;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and Gwenview. goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate pictures in virtually any way as it can also manipulate how it is also a user. your advantage is that it is much easier, & digiplug; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes did in & digiplug; even perform.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your machine, then you don't need to find out more than 1000 photos. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you don't use & digiplug.. if you don't even know how many photos you don't want to store very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need and know what to do in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether other access to your photos will have to save them to a reserved drive, or on a network drive & etc; Please note that you need to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. pictures can be found quickly over your location. if you are taking sufficient photos in one year. if you are taking sufficient photos, then you will be able to use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then use a folder for pictures you will print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like e.g. versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option in the setup page of the metadata in & digiplug; this ensures that EXIF data and IPTC data can be written in the file. if you forget it, then you can select the metadata from the database in the files you can select the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? it presents & digiplug, to give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. of course these are the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should select every photo keywords, captions and an evaluation. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now talk to keywords, keywords, as you are frequently called on other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import Catalogised images from another source with embedded keywords, then the tree is not going to insert the images in the right place. the change of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by the drag of a subtree to another. the modified keywords are being updated by & digious; updated throughout the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very coarse representation, since each block of metadata is composed of many sections. filenames and calendar data are features of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keyword - the next section refers to excerpts or comments, the third important tool for cataloging your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to see most of your photos simply, you want to share it with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer to see some details, people, space.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the landers of the allies & quot; Omaha Beachot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing is. wow! you begin to hear memories, the historical period of time is present again, you might even hear the silence. so you can even change your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others, consider the title itself more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is it the meaning of the viewer you need to understand and understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if a picture is not perfect, when it has the strength to work only with a labeling for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can also use a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8) and you can even export it to a selection of images at the same time. if you export your images in Web galleries, you will have to tell you a second time for your wishes and / or the title of Web-Galeriesystems. so you don't have to tell the story a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find yourself in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with images, the train of the spatial presentation is now running at light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation during the future are countless and will be able to repeat that one day, in the near future, you can also export your travels through images with geographical data. you can also export KML files using Google Earth format. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; using the Google map viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for working others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information about & digiplug has to be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for authorization and author): this field should have your name, or name of the person who has created this photo, for example, if it is not desired to be used the name of the photographer, for example, the name of the photographer has to be used. this field does not have to be changed once more. this field does not support Komma nor Semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autographer (synonym for author line): associated with the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples here can be titles, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. as this is a note to the author's field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editors (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who the photo offers. this must be not necessarily the author. if the photograph is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, the picture will be shown here, then the group / agency will provide the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they cannot provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator, this is the solution for the majority of your photos. for individuals and Halb professionals, this protection is very important to this protection.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digiplug and will provide such a module for staple processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnout error, record failure, power breaches, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, deserts, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you by using traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section you can solve problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Roll Ontrack, the largest data reproduction company in the world, has some interesting statistics that has caused the reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem in case of CDs / DVDs, you may have to buy them more than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archequality. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your messaging space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good discount and good recording devices. the best DVD recordings are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you are much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control function mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for the formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a affordable program called IsoBuster that doesn't work miracles in CDs and DVDs. but there are also similar applications that are not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data of damaged floppy disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to save the format of DVD Blu-ray disc and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8,5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs, of course, also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">If you are slowly burning with a good recording device on high quality media in one not proprietoric format. please do not forget to copy the media with a description, date and author license and then in front of a clean, dark dry and before pets protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before using the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk-makers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturer include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks: floppy study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos keep up the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In the temperature temperament you can't find this error. some of SMART identified error announcing the directly impending failure. these are especially Lesefehler and publishing houses. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also get data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses are normally used without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of power, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. this allows these anomalies blocked keyboards, complete data loss, hardwareaging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against raps is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and the rest is earthed. however, it is usually in the form of a plug bar. remember that not every plug bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you look for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it protects against lightenment and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since there is a overvoltage of each cable to your machine, you should also ensure that all peripheral devices are connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems, which also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can result in the loss of irreplaceable data. it may therefore be meaningful to invest in a break-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overvoltage, these devices can automatically shut down battery energy. this gives you the opportunity to store your data until the current run. if you have a USV you should be sure that they have the same quality standards like a overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare your safety in power disorders at the cost of this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you think so good your computer is protected. at the end you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer you can store any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home, however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions therefore only occur as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-community 23hq.com make online storage services that are based on photos and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional variant provides you more at your disposal, in the case of Flickr. for $25 a year you get unlimited memory, which should only be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">Data backup is very safe from the point of view of the data backup. transmission errors are automatically included thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies offer a backup and a partial memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem zfs and btrfs determine at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection for it. no one seems to have thought in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is much safer than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transfers, as they generate interedences within the data streams. these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transfer problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates which can handle and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope to see it soon also for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Don't estimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss during the notebook and 46% for the job systems. with notebooks already the percentage of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most chisels think. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has long been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the examination process is avoided by a sudden break during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if however, a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are removed from fundamental physical limits. it's meant that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise levels for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are in direction of 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so make sure not anyone else responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected in any year of a data loss. so, do not secure your data after a plan and test this back before you do something dangerous like reinstallation of your operating system, replacing plates or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster beats locally and destroys a lot. forget plane gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft is dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention means an not local storage. bring up the stairs up, into the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a more common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: to the complete backup and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Inkremental backup: backup the files that have been changed since the last backup. it generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such backup has been made. this backup comes to a versioning system next with the exception that it is just off and not progress.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machine. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this happens and if you want to increase the security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to recover and restore losses. at the same time, you come to backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. every additional dilution should be done manually, after which you made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, retrieve photos and metadata, copying images, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you have to review and reassess what time flies. unfortunately, there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system are used backwards. the less variants you have used in the past, the more light it is easier to assess the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document. use or change open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional pressure to change a system in its size. this is actually getting bigger.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have the scalability with your plans and the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmesg, whether your new plate has been detected by the system, but do not hang them up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Connect; dd if = / dev / SDB [#] of = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC / SDC # source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS; residual / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software you can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard, but it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can handle many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format we would like to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossy compress salmus (deflate). a problem is, however, that this format is adapted to many people. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. a handful camera controller is now available and we hope to use the Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology; Extensible Metadata Platforms;, a mixture of XML and RDF; Extensible file information is available with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the file for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it from an original size of your photo, mostly in the raw format, because it can sound the metadata separately from the image file. therefore, it can be noticed at the link between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should be considering whether you use DNG as container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible online metadata standards, which support a large range of application purposes and business models. the activities of DCMI will be working on a wide range of architecture and workshops, standard conferences and workshops, standard connections and reconnaissance efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the reader or scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine layer you can use external programs. if you return the pictures with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off under circumstances of the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. then export it into webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug. in the context of adding a photos to an album you will find a description of how you already have photos that you already have on your hard disk, but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your album base.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use & digiplug; to use your digital camera with & digiplug, connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if this is the case, a Fertig indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file assignment will appear for each file, photos, films, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your machine, you may need the camera information about each entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog features file properties and the photo information that is internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your machine. note that in some digital cameras not all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, production remark, GPS etc of the image. these information is the same as with the Metadata page from the main window of & digior; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then the selection from all of them. this will download all photos of their camera in a single album in & digior. we will download all photos of their camera in an album before downloading the photos from your camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all the photos you can only download the desired choice of boxes of & kde; as soon as you select the photos, use the button download and then download the chosen ones. download the chosen ones as long as you choose some photos selected.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option can be downloaded here. these pictures have not yet been downloaded by & digi. in this case, the new pictures have been selected with a star in front window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download or download selected buttons, select a dialog with which you can select the target album, in which the pictures are sorted, displayed as normal folders. please select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete this from the camera. you can delete all of them once you delete the button delete all. if you only want to delete a few, then you must select it first and then remove delete files.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to restore photos you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check that the photos will be removed successfully in the trashcan; if you want to delete it completely. if you want to erase the camera memory, you should make sure that it is much faster than the camera memory.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos frequently not very meaningful name. the file names are usually recycled again after the photos of the camera were loaded, so it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been made to integrate into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dators based underwear. if you use this last option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three further options which are performed before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the EXIF data are copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M. switch to the option Date & Time. for further adjustments you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the possibility to change the filenames in lowercase. or in uppercase, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digipack; for a photo is used, below the name displayed, the camera will be stored in the preview. your settings for renaming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to take time in recording, not all cameras are ready for use. in Section sidebar Metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not supply these information, the photo is mounted in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button labeled and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made available on the date you can use this photo, can be used to download the picture data. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the picture data. all pictures with the same date will be downloaded to the picture data. in Section sidebar Meta-data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, stores & digiplug. if you want to change this option, you need to disable this option and select the date-based underwear at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the button download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you should select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection selection is done, ask & digiplug; you, where the pictures are to be loaded high. select the folder settings dialog for the camera. select the desired folder, and press OK to delete the upload. images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographer, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to address an area by automatic intake of GPS data. environment planner, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can view a browser which indicates the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digifile; users who want to locate the place of the photo, or simply document this aspect, it is well to save position data of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 is supported by many GPS data fields, such as direction, articulated and map references. it is at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographic assignment (manual) and lastly via manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few working together with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be saved with gpsman or gpsbabel, as this is the only format which is the only format supported by the module to geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS which can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page, you can make the same under & Linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">When you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script using the Exifield of Phil Harvey. it uses the signs of hairy coordinates, e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road types. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digipsis; tries to give you much control of its working processes as possible. in order to access this settings, you have to set up in the Settings menu; set up in eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be set on a set preview or image processing. you will thus specify the default behavior of & digiplug if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardidacy and copyright data. these data will be selected automatically in the respective IPTC data fields, even if the option is synchronized with data from the camera interface. these data are also written in IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for author line: this field should be the job title of the photographer. this can be a freelance photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the car field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for vendors: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if this is a picture agency such as Reuters or Associated Press; and if the picture is a picture photo, the group / agency should be the image available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data to the relevant IPTC Felder. thus, the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digiplug; this metadata is also available in & digior; imported or imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image label as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you can also add to your photos, with the images embedded in the images. attention: with pictures which have already been inscribed, they will be overwritten by & digious.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer will rest in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to fix which file types & digiplug, you can remove the file extensions of this list and remove any of these extensions, which will not have any of these extensions, ignored by & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the button updated right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the brightness of & digiplug; can be set on this page at the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can only get better computing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in the image field, this indication mode can be switched off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, the images in higher resolution of luminance can be encoded as in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the close explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression settings, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this to a high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using TIFF files, you can compress the deflate compression utility for TIFF-images. this reduces the size of TIFF-images. it has no influence on image quality, since the deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can safely save yourself. even if you have the lossy-enabled setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was still not supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digiplug, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently it is very quick to manipulate a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are identical to the pixels of sensitive light. if you use this option with minimal loss of details, this option marks a bit soft, eliminates the image a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 pattern pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the whiteboard used in the camera will be used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white-off is not set. default, it is a fixed colour balance, which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images will get more details into the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shlichter, so the parts of your images are being burned down as seen through the inability of your camera, as they show the shallowable white in the settings. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing data from the plants.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not so fast satiated like green and red. & craw are therefore trying to reconstruct the missing green and red shareholdings of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how many colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the possibility to set a level. this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value according to your taste. you might have to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1. but this can also later be made into the image options of the & digiplug. in order to keep the time for demosaicing, you should keep conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial data sensor, which have many cameras and is known as a matrix colour pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digipack; and Drapw set you three alternatives at disposal: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Drapw. however, it creates colour business acts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color load of your lenses you can put the red and blue reproof values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction correction, as you are performed during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions as these. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information like the colour information of a colour space in the other are thus able to translate the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior, if a picture is opened in image processing, start the image management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder click here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / user / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digiplug; examine these folders then during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC Profiles you have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profile settings. everything can be changed when opening the shell file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color administer not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to use the camera organ and model you are using. there are some examples like Canon, which do not have color mapping or gammar restructure. currently, dcraw gamma isn't corrected for conversions at 16 bits. this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options such as the Soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate how your printer can be restored from one device, as your printer can handle a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. you could manually adjust to the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obviously what color profile is foreseen for them. unfortunately, there is not a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is naturally inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile extension lets you know the style for the purpose: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Portraitand S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin interface. it is a interface that can support & digiplug; many modules support which have been written to work together with each program supporting the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of the available modules. then select the list of the available modules. these modules will then appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks specified by modules, can be set in the menu below settings commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) via KIPI modules can be accessed via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjust the time between the transitions, usually 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes turn on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras. on the right hand there is a button automatic detection that is connected to the computer, and if you want to use it, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image display mode. at the moment, the port settings are supported, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera. this field will only be active if you have a USB or FireWire mass storage camera. you must enter the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / hoist on which you enter your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your computer to display and turn on display in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try to check if & digiplug; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camerodell and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option dialog dialog for shifting of &gt; images in the trashcan you can set the talk of & digious; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details when deleting a photo and deletion of a album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be used to use and use digiplug; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback. otherwise, you must apply changes to the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also use the viewing screen of & digiplug and when starting. this accelerates from & standoffs under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting at the start after new photos are forcing & digiplug to look for the basic folders on new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the starting time of & digiplug. if something was removed from the base file, ask & digiplug, you whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digior; in order to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug; you will find further information on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug. includes a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and to view and improve your pictures. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the entry and selection of the entry / editing menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; therefore, under circumstances, you are not part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can be found in the image field.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current file number, and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before adding file Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can save you with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using from the menu file restore or the button restore the image editing in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done at your photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by changing the editing, resuming or restore editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should undo the keyboard shortcut, ctrl; -z to reverse and ctrl-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; via the default state or restore button in the toolbar no longer press a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be reversed in between.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigational buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made any changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo in and out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; Mausrad or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the Ansafts menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you do not wish to use the toolbar. normally, you can also see the toolbar. if you do not wish to call this in the dialog dialog of & digiplug, you can see this in the settings dialog. see this section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, select the image below and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences. all images are printed out of your choice. you only need to select the images from your choice, and select from the menu item export assistant assistance. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">Der & digiplug; main window has a side bar on the right edge, the important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available, even in image processing. it will be shown if one of the five riders will be clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same rider lets the side bar appear or restarted back to the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view you can input or insert mock with unlimited size. note: the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed, so that you can use the EXIF and IPTC- fields to allow you to use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are formed after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After having commented it, use either the button users or simply switch to the next picture, the labels will be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. but you can also read the metadata in the files. this will always be done if you have a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be applied in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field written by the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering out words, the keyword tree and a select box that previously applied in this & digibox; session attached.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can restrict the number of possibilities when looking for a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief for input keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they will be stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keyword can also be set by marking the appropriate check box in the tree. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image, if you want a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The lateral bar angle filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their Album, - Datum-, Keyword and search Outlook. if additionally one or more key filters are used in the right hand, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop. suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to comment on. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and click on the selection. then, a dialog you will ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays images on a calendar day. the keyword is selected on no keywords, which have been selected with Ctrl + a. they were taken with Ctrl + a, and afterwards, a keyword will be removed from the right stitch tree to the selection. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes occurs on every start of the program. it can also be switched off other settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and create and find that it would have a or be it, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify a Advanced Search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why didn't Picasaweb or Flickr have not been listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I used it mainly on & digiplug and adapted to concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you have a color-managed workflow, which may have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors print from your camera or scanner and the colours you print or in the web, which correspond to those of your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color administration, then everyone wants to know which buttons it must press for the results which he wants. unfortunately, you will give you sufficient background information about colour management at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make links with deeper information allow you to make your own informal decisions that you obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows meets all of the criteria listed below, you do not need to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are currently working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture issues are by e-mail or web, where sRGB the de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and the life for everyone is doing so easy, then why one should use another color space and thus have to worry about color changes?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB comparing sRGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufei area, and colours in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's transparent hand and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to load my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in sRGB colour space or do not work, you need to cracked your monitor because sRGB using sRGB, so you have to use your monitor on sRGB using sRGB, then you have to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool has five automatic corrections available, which can improve one image in most cases. therefore, use it before you try to check a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The features normalize, isolated, automation and contrast extend from the menu Corrigate Automatic Correction Record automatically from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which best works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the lampstands values about the entire picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its colour shady. this function is often a magistical correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Absame: this method adjusts the brightness of the colors of the selected picture, so that the histogram of the intensity of light is as flat as possible. sometimes it also produces very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either caused miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic abused: this method maximizes the color area inside the red, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogrammical area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrasting: this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & digipsis; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white off of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is slightly restricted since using a color space with 8-bit per color. in case you can carry out too far from the original image, which works in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-like salmus which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you can launch it via menu input colors white off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window window can be adjusted in size. on the left, you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target range. once again you want to see the original screen, then it is enough to click the image window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of pixel among this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram shows that dynamic is altered as soon as you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small Luminate values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadow Adjustment lets you improve or down the shadow of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To insert the pin with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette to use this button and then click anywhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white equivalent. in this way, the temperature and green values will also be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">You can also set the white off on the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure visual kator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. this will show the combined result in the white template. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons as and loading make exactly this. each setting of the whiteness that you have set can be stored in a text file and later reload them again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button settings will return all the filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white-like. note that even neutral settings will be able to create another photo as your original. if you save it, your original image will change.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the code entry per color channel of the machined image. 8 bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality pictures, but this encoding is also needed for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profils. it uses the change and assignment of color profils. a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used for using color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to be found in the menu under color toning correction and allows you to save multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you can make use of your camera or your scanner at the same error and therefore you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the calibration correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to remove that you can find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">This & digiplug tool has four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and a cantons filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect that was created when one described a partially developed print of a short flashlight. this result was a partial negativ of the image. this tool was a partial negativ of the image. this tool allows you to adjust these interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity the image shows what chemically is possible. an additional increase will eventually produce a negative image that is not created on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is the (1) and the processed intensity (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an optimised color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition by & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth photo structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors, but also some photographs, especially those who have hardly immersed in landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight to contrasting edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the slide repeat the strength of the neonlight. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color concurrent and the brightness of your photo. you can also experiment with the various colour-effects of your photo with the tools in the menu. once you're satisfied with the result you can use the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo of bad lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce your saturation instead. all changes you can perform in preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple candleur / contrast / gamma is the tool tonic for the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog becomes very complicated to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool looks very complicated, you need the three sliding parts below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, an histogram, the active edge or the selected area. under the graph, three slider can be clicked on, and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn operation is to shift the regulator and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side you can see the original and preview of the picture. viewing is dynamic, using the settings of the picture, the following options are available on the left.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selbox can be set, if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic y axis is shown. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark notes, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, frequently gammazes.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinboards can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the values of shadows, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field. there are also two regulator that can be used to change the output value as in the input value. for example, the compression of the output value can be used as a background to create something else in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, image values will automatically set automatically depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Download: using these buttons, the used values in the file system can be saved and later loaded again. it will use Gimp levels format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipings, you will be re-adjusted for all shadows, medium and solar notes. enable the colour pipette that you want to use and click on a preview of the original image for rotational, green, blue and light channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overload indiscribe controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator that means you get the effect just in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the surgery applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output value is unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image is shown. the preview will be updated dynamically in dependence of your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows you to specify the channel which is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures featuring large areas of a constant color, the linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a cursor to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with darker expanders and the associated pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see. if you want to change this mark on the corner which represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Download: with these buttons you can make exactly this. every turn that you generated can be saved in filesystem and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp Course format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points in the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sunshades. enable the paint pipette that you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposure Indicator controls all colour channels to view overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the effect displayed only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo that was corrected in the Luminanzcanal. shadow and sun tones was placed with the color pipette and applied to curves. the original image is (1) and adjusted (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">Der & digiplug channel mixer; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels, or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the shades of the pictures. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of the channels you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be regarded as comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the histogram will show you the respective color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The control for the module are right below: knob for red, green and construction allow you to activate these channels. this is particularly convenient if you are also able to reduce the corresponding color component, because the channel mixer is designed to generate excellent black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the color channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color does not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose sound pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer-setup allows you to save and then load them. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overload indiscribe controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator that means you get the effect just in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. option Luminanz will be activated. the original image is below (1) and the painted picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography always was fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step, since colour images can be easily converted to the machine. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford X5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a green lentil filter. this looks great, with all sceneries and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so much like the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Publisher: simulates a black / white film coating with an orange linear filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so much like the 002 Cokin (TM) Oranfelter.</seg>
<seg id="454">RotFilter: simulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sides effects and can simulate lunar fabrics for the day time. so much like the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film coating with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiatric: produces warm light and medium sound while he adds a bit of cold in the shattunes. this is very similar to the process of getting a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatric oner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digiplug and tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a screen, the lurch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged spots or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or tridimensionality of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and changed under (2). the parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Using the & digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of an observer in the limits of a picture is no easy task. it is possible to keep his attention to the image. this is a psychological barrier for the streak eye. under picture frame the module can be started using image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. through the image with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), it surrounds it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a bone feather and decoratively adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original target image, but the original aspect ratio will be larger than the original aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool for aspect ratio earlier.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple formatted text in a picture at any spot. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with your features. the larger the image, the greater the character set. by the end you can simply select a frame to the text and / or a semi-transparent background. the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed by clicking on the button OK. after the image has been saved once, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digiplug and tool template, you can put a template on a template.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image templates apply in image processing can be used to lay templates about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. if you want to add the PNG file format and if you want to add a template of the template's size, please send us an e-mail in english to the & digiplug; mail list digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">When you use this tool for the first time, you have to set up your template folder with the button Base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you select the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for templates, the folder structure of the template folder appears. the selection of a folder updates the previewing panel of templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview, there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller size: this button shrinks the box below. if you want to use the mouse on the image. if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture, please check the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to shift the image below the template. take the image and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your photo. the image is then adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug has three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but especially in dark areas, grainy.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it's not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">It is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digital images need a correction of the sharpness. this is the result of the digitalization process to summarize with just minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed if color pixels are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more imminent sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures often have been used in internal sharpness. images in the raw format on the other hand should always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners do not apply a sharply filter during the reading of the picture. if you deactivate this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by using a photo with the sharpening counter. you can call Corrigate sharpness using the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But in this case you should work carefully, as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, you can focus on the menu entry Corrigate. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a bit soft, use the tool to command with the menu entry Corrigate sofar and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right-hand side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help process the image. the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first amplify the effect. if you make the sharpness mask to be strong, noise and the impression of grats will produce in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius does like many pixels on each side of a channel caused by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore shark pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The sum provides the percentage between the original and the printed picture, which is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount. you can define a minimum difference for a canoe of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded, and therefore beauty defects in faces, sky and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the painted picture (2). unsharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; Tool Refocus refocussed on image by improving the sharpness. it used the protected defaltation filter -Algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to burn a picture to & quot; refocuserquot; in which it is better to sharpens the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. it is mostly used to use better results than unsharp. you can start from the menu by using colors and focus on image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular slab works much better than the Gauss's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung also has a very long tail, which is far influenced by the original torch. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's Faltung will even be very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. that causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular Faltung. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be very unsharp, but then on Heiligenschema.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Roughtsfilter: an increase in the prehfilter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very badly. a useful value is 0,03. a high value is added to the image even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your unseless Gauß is caused. in most cases, you should probably use this value to 0 to increase annoying artifacts, so you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the bootloader.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizenry size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. however, you can select good results especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the Gauß's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameters which you have set will be stored for later and then may be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, paint- and intensity carctures on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much surgeries changes are not immediately visible, but it will leave uncomfortable artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading and compress pictures, eg. JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masks used a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unspicy masking always have to produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it may never indicate that it is the optimal lens filter. practical is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters. practical is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters. the FIR Wiener filter is often better for editing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of focus on a digital picture, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob plain uses the sharpness of the area which was blacked out to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinte allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unrequired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various preferences as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed posture [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth smooth curve above the image. if a value of 0.9 should be provided for greater homogenous regions. a value of 0.9 should not be provided. please note that no sharpening should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value is smooth evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. in case you have a high value of wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts will be best removed at a value nearby 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, adjust this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is difficult to value the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passing through. usually 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle length da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small selected, it should also be selected too small for a long time. you should be able to select this value as much as possible and for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel-smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality you get by selecting this option is low. but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons as and loading make exactly this. correct setting of image errors may be saved in a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and a high CPU load. so you can download the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image bugs with little artifacts will be corrected. the module is shown in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a unique black artifact that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image appears under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digipack; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter tailor.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen picture above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain noise which can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can stay in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can be smoothed by the radius and the colour in it is smoother and thus minor mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the edge of the filter. if it is increased the pixel pitch, if it is increased, you may need to change the edges of the filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can not get more and rocket or dirt starts again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response can be removed or hash tips can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these attitudes do not influence the smoothing process of the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these attitudes do not influence the smoothing process of the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly roughing, but it also tolerates the shadow zones.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts on variations of luminance. if it is too high, the noise and phasenjitter can appear on the edges. it can remove rushing points and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction could change your lives. the original image is marked with (1) and adjusted with (2) the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes, a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw a little soft when doing so much easier than a painting with the menu entry Corrigate sofar and experiment with the plain. the preview window on the right-hand side of the dialog shows the Effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digipack features; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoring gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's sound, film granting, scratches, compartments and local mistakes that makes it possible along the image contours and thereby gets the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the texture is performed with another tool, the image error correction, was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labs in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it produces some compression & quot; artifact quot; - small standards which are shown in uncompressed picture. this setting is meant to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons as and loading make exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and a high CPU load. you can therefore download the calculation at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce how to reduce a photo with anti-shaped rocket. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded using a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. you can see the notorious movie (1) and the corrected paper (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures was reduced to an old colour picture, which was used with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that can be seen from the scanner lighting and photopapier. the original image below (1) can be seen and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Der & digiplug; Tool Hotpixel allows it to remove Hotpixel by photos that have a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially popular with high quality raw screen photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; at the moment there is no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Dark Screen. the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to discover the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the right dark picture to the corrected image. note that the wizard remembers the last dark picture and will automatically download it in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image range and preview can help you correct the result within the image. the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are emphasized in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is determined by an average of the neighbouring pixels. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation it is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all the pixels with a gap of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a batch of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in bloc.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color picture, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Der & digipsis; Vigadmittance correction is a tool to correct the Vigadation, i.e. subject corners, one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially the medium and large photo format, can often not light up the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignitierenquot; (shady) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there. TeleObjective under conditions also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it has also disadvantages. many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also use the center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, otherwise unblurable effects are created by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure of digital cameras and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by using an equivalent transformation for an image that is applied without this filter. the algorithm is protected by a Centerfilter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three Regulators, you can control the Vigadite correction filter and with three further reexposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light power attenuation at the point of the biggest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which is compensated by a optical filter with an aperture level of 1, or by chance to compensate the density around a larger degree of Vigadation.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the Vigadflation correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the knob will only provide positive values when you need to raise the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust a finer re-adjustment of the exposure of the target image, adjust the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the layer of the & digipsis; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vigadmitting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the corrected image in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a lampshade and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug included; Lindendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric resolution of the lens, and can correct the concave or convex form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometrical adjustment can be eliminated almost.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree. with negative values, tons-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values wedge-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth count. this value is stronger to change than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter the reverse sign of the parameter general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and resulting in the correction of the first degree. negative values are larger and larger in positive the image size.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview the distortion correction. values that you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or wedge-shaped correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes. best result in this correction as all first. if you have a picture new and then carry a bit shaped correction, the effect is apparent of the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to be found, this tool shows you a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to a crucial place such as the seabed or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in connection, you can correct the tonne / capped distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a ragm distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu transforming cutting from the image processing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tons-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives like footage from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you have the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the relative correction for a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared video from the Gimpguru.org site which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with your mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters and simulate film screenings (ISO). if you want to simulate the grains of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the quantity of filming and dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows will be white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos since the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra filmic label applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image has been set under (1) and the revised picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO Values produce a type Aura in the shorts.</seg>
<seg id="595">Der & digiplug; filter film production is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is of classic high-speed movies, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, to increase the sensitivity of the films to enhance the producer of the photo emulsion of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-effectiveness effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image will get rid of everyday life. in case you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photograph, grayish sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains, although often higher values are needed, even if you need more grains, then you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film proof effect applied to a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used movie sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">Der & digiplug; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">Der & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like oil paintings. natural pictures and stylistic life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to influence this effect. the upper elects the pin size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images. smooth brush or, from the other hand looks, the hindereness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the screen is marked with the (2). pin size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">Der & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients in order to create a kohleskizze. therefore, the lines that change the outline in drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you would have chosen to outline which scene you would have chosen for you. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal recording filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">Der & digiplug; filter engraving: your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">Der & digiplug; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10% is the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the painted picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">Using this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion effects. it uses the protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: divide the image in cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the shaft blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="614">Using this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of sharpness effects. it uses the protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom in sharpness: wither the picture along the shaped lines run by a central point. this simulates the sharpness a zooming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale: sharpness the image by rotating pixels around a centre. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: wirelessly to produce the effect of a non-focused camera lenses. the object seems to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion acuity: wither the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or a move, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Plasticizing imacuity: wiped the picture softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dream and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle bulb.</seg>
<seg id="620">Contactors: blends the image by accidental displacement of the pixels and simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpenfe: finds the paddling pool in the picture and wipe them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then create it with average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore download this calculation at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural your pictures a wet look. it uses a sheltered volume by Pieter Voloshyn protected by protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dropping size allows to change the size of the drop. as the droplet size is not automatically generated with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. count changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep using & digiplug; image processing can keep a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that will remain free. if you start the filter Regentropes the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of raindrops filters. the original image (1) shows a peaceful sunset and the painted picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or rotating into the right orientation. the tools you find in the menu transformers turning / shutter mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you zoom in a picture? how can you re-invent a picture? how can you re-invent the missing information? how can you reinvent the missing information here? how can you reinvent the missing information here? the CImg algorithm is used here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transition size change in menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Using the tool to size, use a linear interpolation method to shrink the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, try the tool to inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation for the increase of an image. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the Rider New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Please maintain the aspect ratio when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained by entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is difficult to value the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons as and loading are used exactly. each insert for photo may be stored as a text file and later loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very quick to do with what it does, but it can take very long and a high CPU load. you can download the calculation at any time with the button fastening.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating that a small color image was enlarged to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the larger image is the result of the linear output enhancement compared to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a common operation, but also a often underestimated tool to make a picture. the image processing makes it very easy. to make a photo you need to view a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and ascend the rectangle, you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the button again the field of the photos will be cut off. by this way you can change a good overview as your photo after cutting. a new rectangle can create it by simply changing the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting edge, use the button labeled Edit buttoning button in the toolbar and the photo becomes cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or Save files under the menu to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the scope of view, you can change the size of the rectangle, shift the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folding to aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high format or landscape format. in the high format, the larger value of the height and in the transverse format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio is used an relative aspect ratio. this means it's always the same whether you are able to use it inches, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to select the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in the dialog box can be set with the Max. ratio button the area for cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relation and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool can cut according to aspect ratio and displays its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). when you use the tooling tool the EXIF data are stored in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the original image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the collisions enable help to hide in, so that you can put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like third elrees, harmonious triangles are possible to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division of different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flaming leaves of a sunflower. it dives in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used for the ancient Egyptians and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number is equal to 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows is considered visually harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides smoother relief lines if you put together a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangle. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. that can be a line or different objects. this one can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfill its purpose.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also derived from the above-mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, gold triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create a effect of the professional photographs dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting spots and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't reach anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adapt the color of the lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture by any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are rotated around a angle. you can fix it with the & digior; image processing and the tool free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide is specified in degrees. with the button settings you can set the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module features free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line at your disposal. after setting it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a print to the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is the function transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option allows you to do a little bit after rotating. note, however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed to a fixed point in the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then be new automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty spaces that are caused by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty spaces that are caused by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angles below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit dirty. for individual adjustment is small but two customizations create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unwanted triangular holes on the corners. one way to clean this is the image with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The sound tool is used to shift part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module over transformation scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors form your image by using horizontal angles and vertical angles. if you press preferences, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of the Effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target range will be shown on the right of the display.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help will create a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the control tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having done the shift, the image is withered. for a single shift, this effect is usually negligible, but two chings create twice as much pudding and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shifting the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is the image with transition cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write in some cases from your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiliated. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression driving on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save lossless, if this is indicated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the image format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format pictures into JPEG or TIFF with the Rohkonverter of & digi. in the configuration you will find further information about using modules with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphs; is a KDE program for viewing and graphic programs. graphs are used in science, particularly in science, particularly in the computer, particularly in the computer; so far, there was no modern & GUI. programs, which are & graphic; - or & tcltk; - programs with only few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraph interface; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all features of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs; displays Graphene with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; - program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & Kate; and & Conqueror; (such that a change of graphic in & Kate; the graphs newly calculated and in & kgraphviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph into & Kate; open the graphic in & kgraphs; open in a & Kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a hack to show more than those nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & kgraphs; is a & kde; - program, which requires & graphicz; - tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. requires in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the open graph, each in an own window. initially, if you start & kgraphs; without a argument, the toolbars only contains the symbol file and the (empty) list last open files. click on the first icon to view the Open file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you select one or more & dot; - files selected, the main window looks like at the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is bigger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right at pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has just been changed in & kgraphic; charged file from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change, so you may change your decision as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up your decision to change the Settings; Settings... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph out outside of a current & kgraph; -instance; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphic card; instance, or want to display the loading graphs in a window of the already current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option you can permanently save your choice, but also change the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program startup, you can open all the graphics of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely elected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts are stored on one page, the aspect ratio is ignored. if you are keeping the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The page again gives you the opportunity to specify the behaviour when a file was changed on the hard disk, eg; from another program. you can define a default behavior (automatically upload or download the changes) or download the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page opening is the possibility to specify the behaviour of & kgraph; if a graph is opened outside of a current session, you can open a default behavior for this case (or in a window of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localise images of geographically in the spherical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo will be used to locate it. height, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data, you need a GPS track as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want correlate in the main window and call up the menu. in order to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you have to load a track file with GPX file, of course, which have been recorded at the same time at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed in red. GPS Spurdates are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera has to be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. this can be done with the time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time variance gives a top deviation for the GPS time and camera address. the deviation between them will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality you can place a locomotive in a wide time difference between camera and GPS, you can set this limits here and then press the button correlated.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place. as the dialog box comes to the next place you only have to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map by and after you are found. please choose the relevant region and increase it again until you have reached a submittent accuracy. the card must always be selected manually. the map can be changed from map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exact tool is used to provide a stack of images using GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages. the character set will be encoded with UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the tab can be matched. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML. you can quickly select a large number of albums. in this area you can quickly see a large number of albums. in the area below is the Albenpreview and the text will appear in the head of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Rider Appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this rider is clearly explained by itself. if you then click on a picture a new page will be displayed in the picture. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images. select a folder that contains all of you. a folder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth, you can change the standard color depth. this also influences the file size. all other settings are explained by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Rider thumbnails allow you some of the settings from the Album Rider for the thumbnails, that are small pictures to be displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. push down the process to break down the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module produces the pages the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program uses to determine if errors during generation occurred. the web browser will be launched automatically at the end to show the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and perform base operations like rotations, zooming, or shifts. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG free module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store images listed below, to save images in JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is that the file size is rising, because no compression of the colour information is taking place. this can be found again in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera cable is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. in case you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor is currently no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-Imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI Team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy the data from one image to another. then select the image selection dialog with which you want to copy the image file, so the image to which you want to copy the password. copy the data to the button OK after that you want to copy the file.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder has a tool to convert a set of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kocelerer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG-Video, with a defined length, to convert the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic training computer between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background colour for the Diashau. with this module, it is possible to create a DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD file for your DVD player. you can finally use the K3b program to burn the medium.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first have to packed the images that are packed into the MPEG Diashau. then you can create the module via Extras MPEG-aschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should customize the other settings. if you are planning to adjust the video format from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. a low value produces very sudden, high contrast, very smooth figure.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should be able to set them black. in doubt you can specify the name and path of the created file in the name of the MPEG output file. if possible, keep the grounding mpg if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, then it will be integrated into the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go back or enjoy a coffee in the speed of your computer, and enjoy the hashau if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that codiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages above the button settings on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print several pictures on one sheet paper. the combined images can also be updated automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is currently useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import / convert images stored in one of three formats in JPEG, TIFF or PPM formats.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original works of Him is: do not expect the same results as the software from your camera controller. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw video Converter window appears then in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the change process. the first option decides, whether the camera settings are to be used for the whiteboard used. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file formats.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you have to edit your pictures frequently or continue to use in JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations not permitted before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you are JPEG as a memory format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings with the button button you can start converting. if you want to break this process back, then you can break it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile-processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, for example by testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite the file automatically. this is helpful if it's done in a previous attempt. however, the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the convert convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the estamps used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can shrink or enlarge the image from the image size:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt to your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: the proportionate size change into two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepare the image for photo pressure. the user can adjust the resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background colour, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the added images in advance. more pictures can go on the list of images added.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures show window with the images you have chosen, you can add more images via the button. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and add it to the images that you have to add.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures remove the selected pictures from the list of selected pictures.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message to your E-mail client with the button OK. you'll need to add the addresses and the subject here. the images selected by you are already attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Please take care of sending many images at a time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of the e-mails. it is possible to send some emails when you want to send many images.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used each time again until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in an attached file the comments are attached to the images into a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images File Format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it is best to use PNG, if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">When you select JPEG pictures of file format, and the original files in JPEG format will be added to the original image files.</seg>

<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation use very elegant picture transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slides will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file names indicate that the filename of the images in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop Loop provides for this the presentation in a final loop. you can then remove it manually with Esc;</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select randomly so the images are displayed in random order. thus, the order of images in the album is not used.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under the delay between the pictures, the distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect. you should thus be out before you show the presentation of your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly selects from any transition between the images a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>

<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date is currently no documentation. in case you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets up the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have received your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse & photo album; by these browses, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image, then in people, places and in group key words are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories, for which you have typed your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumbnails. in the following it is described each for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press with the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are shown. by this method of selection, you can restrict the number of images added to a few thousand pictures on a couple of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view images to view images of your area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name. you can store with & photoalbum; however, for each person you have an own thumbnails, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images beside the name, select the button labeled on the right outside on the toolbar. note that you can view the view for each category. note that you can view the view for each category. (if you don't have any suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>

<seg id="907">If you are looking for a string in the field of label or description, you may also enter a date, you can also enter a date, so for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a part of the whole date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like reading handbooks, but rather want to try handbooks, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick access, screen photos and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & grab a photo album; and select the demo in the first dialog, if you start & photo album; for the first time start, or choose the menu entry kphotoalbum; please download some example pictures and you can download the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the window of & kphotoalbum; see the time bar. a picture of this strip can be seen here: as the name suggests, this strip shows you date statistics about images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timetable can display several different time units. each bar shows a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the most only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be active in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date you will always display the first picture of this date in preview Editor) and in addition, the timeline will always display the current date of the time shown in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button, and the mouse over the lineal of the time line, so the time indication, so, when you select a range, you can break the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Photo Album; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user book it is described in & kphotoalbum; built-in version, which you can view over the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. each area will be described in detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, you indicate the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on photoalbum; HTML Example pages see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & photo album; -Export file should be created on the review page. close information on export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select what information is displayed on the HTML page. for example, you can see that information is apparent without the viewer. for example, that all pictures are exported from a party. for example, all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this will not be made specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this makes those who have to view your website and have a monitor that have the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images which have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer you have set the resolution at any time you have set the resolution at any time. it can browse your pictures with low resolution, as well as if he's getting a picture bigger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the various folders and URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a basic folder for all of your HTML files, and for each subsequent set of a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the root folder, where all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be saved and once again will be added to all future pictures. this folder can be selected for all future pictures. here you can either select a folder or a supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if you're actually created all for the viewer you have a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL you should have here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files are not yet stored in the final target folder, you need to manually copy it. thus, you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The options described above have all three basic folders and URLs related. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you will set in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you can, of course, you may have a lot of time for viewing the pictures, people on the pictures, recording, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work is not even once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. image properties will be imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the file only a link to the file. the advantage of all images in the file is stored, and the obvious downside is the file size. the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim -file directly from the menu file export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, it will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two times. first, the images that are displayed in the file of .kim file. if the images are displayed in the folder of .kim file, it is only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export images are described, which you can invoke the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act on internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">To copy the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatic to copy the .kim file, copy & photoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed to JPEG, and the XML file itself is usually very small, it's usually not to compress the files. if you want to compress this, simply select the file export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page reads a maximum image size. if you don't want to send your friends pictures, as the .kim file would be quite large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select & kphotoalbum; the export database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, afterwards, in which folders to import images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are called for the category persons of the imported file to be imported (if you are a Dane), while this category is called in your database. therefore, you will be imported into the third dialog box, which should match the categories of the imported file and which categories will match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can see the categories of the resulting file associated with the categories of your current database. for example, see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and view images: if you look at pictures you often want to watch images of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this guide you will find out the various steps from (1) Put the information on your images, through (2) to check out and pass through (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your images. but it was expanded and today also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual, the pictures are talking about images, but frequently this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Photo Album; stores all of his information in the file index.xml in the uppermost file of their images. it is a simple XML file, which you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, to back up a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; remember the folder where your pictures are stored and used it for future Starts. if you want to insert another folder with pictures, you can start a different folder with pictures, you can download & photo album; with the -c option. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">To create a photo album from the menu entry in photoalbum; set up in a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user book you will discuss the various settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call settings the preview and options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed assistance is available, which you can call through a button transfer to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described as you can specify several features for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog box, which is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete list groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of one mediator as in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the settings you are available for setting up the member groups, select the category you can configure. in the left window, you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digikam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin Interface. please find information on the Kipi homepage.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page, which you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with several applications together, it can be used to test the modules with & photoalbum; so you should use new modules first with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. don't say, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI together are very different, which can be some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums. even if & photo album; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules, so you can use the & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Be simulated & photo album; the current album, which corresponds to the current view, so all images that look at the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the latest album & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here's & photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used by the category to set you in the dialog box as a category for virtual albums, for example, if you would like to use the category people, will do & kphotoalbum; so if you would have chosen people to view and give it to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog, and select module modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; starting with your own images.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, you will see a menu bar at the top. in the tool bar, you will see the window that you still have no information about your pictures. in this section, we will find no information about your images. now, click on the image to show you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the opportunity to view each image with notes on the picture, where the image has been taken in etc. you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images shown at the same time. if you are depicted on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by which you can specify people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again if you will always enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the shifting of the images within the list: if you are shown for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures shown the same 5-10 people, you can find that the names used up are moved up, the people are coming quickly and assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetical list of list, click on the icon button for sorting after the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notices for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected pictures and add these pictures with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a remark.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all over the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that displays the USA as a subgroup. to show you that it is a subgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of note talk, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or Subcategory. in addition, you can also make an entry into a category of this entry. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking the rim of the boxes, click and move the upper edge of the frame, click and move it. you can also move from a frame also by drawing it outside the window range.</seg>
<seg id="980">When you have adapted the window of the window to your needs you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options..., which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also finish a frame even completely. if you want to resign this window later, use the button Options... and here then window a / out. this procedure can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or any pictures if you do not have a filter. an example here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simple to bottom pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on your desktop background, this image is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete or delete your selection menu or select Edit menu. now you'll see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& B photo album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use with & photoalbum; namely, you can also use the pictures anywhere, so & photo album; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures from the hard drive can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, where the right upper corner is cut off, is not stored on the hard disk. this is, for example, on the pictures 1-9, however, the preview pictures are present, so & photoalbum; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this feature that you need files from folders and copy them again. if you would like to avoid the recording of your pictures until now, please purchase a bigger disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to stay in a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that you can see for others and you can also see all the images that you can see your little Sister, chiming and select the menu entry All except above.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the Fall. if you want to lock the laptop in your little Sister, so select all the images you have locked, shut down. if you want to get the pictures back, click lock up.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be submitted to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change your password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is not very secure. you can read or delete all the pictures on the hard drive and to the others, the password as unencrypted text can only be able to read or delete the password. this kind of password protection is only for those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; of course, you can spend hours over time so you want to look at some time. for this reason, & photo album; this is the reason you can start preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. it shows of course the image, but additional all the information you have about the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox can be seen on the upper part of the picture you can see, you can also configure it with your mouse and click anywhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all. all these options are available on the viewer right click the viewer below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene, the browser gives you all pictures of Anne Helene as if you would have chosen people from your browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back, by using the buttons on high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can then run it as a slide. & photo album; invites you to press a new image after a few seconds. how frequently it can press a new image by pressing the Ctrl button and Plus or Minus. launched and stopped by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful skill of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; can it be changed to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to change in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer you can easily drag the viewer into the image. you can easily draw a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button, you can zoom out the Plus button in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and displays the result of the zooming.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot button, you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not shown zooming, so that each pixel is set on the screen of a pixel image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make note to the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can view images, you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to set out on the image. in the moment you can watch the check and configuration dialog of the picture, but you might only consider the picture to mark and see further images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start the viewer with the images and select it as good or bad, while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features, while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you are using the corresponding letters. in view a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so you can see all the images you want, print or whatever you choose. this is in detail. then you can use a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and particularly features can be displayed in front view. if you can view the categories in the view screen, then you can add features to the pictures by simply press the letter for the feature after the image has been selected. you can see here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case you can watch & photoalbum; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted structure is not stored in the image, but in the database. on the way you can undo your cold later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In a picture you can see a picture on the painted screen. in order to check out the painting of & kphotoalbum; in order to finish the painting from the context menu. simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to know the application of the program & Povray; you must not fully control the documentation of & Povray; you should absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire-screen views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select several objects at the same time, but not the object object of an already chosen object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deletion either from the menu bar under editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply this change. if you have invalid values, you will report a message with error description. then you can click on the input errors and discard changes to user.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the self-economic view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the self-economic view and a small example of the scene is rounded off with the chosen texture. if you want to render the entire texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), check out locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can pull these control points with the mouse and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model display. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling the mouse throughout the window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual object as a wire model. you can specify this value relatively to the visibility of the parent or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only then, if they are selected or their visible cycle is smaller or equal in the toolbar chosen for the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window encode as default. the object tree and view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window alignment, or if you need another arrangement, you can set it on any way. you can also save multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be installed properly. this version is in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering symbol Rendering the symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rename a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can install any number of Render modes, from a fast preview up to full range of quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on icon The Render icon in the toolbar or in the View View menu... select the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can type any name, it is useful, but a name that lets you know the mode of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the Slendertone image. if you want to render only one small section of the picture, select the checkbox subsection and enter the image cut into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the drop down quality you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering, using a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection illumination. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is planted with only one ray per pixel, you may have different mistakes in curves and lines, and sometimes details do not appear when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technology called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, pictures with this characteristic look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling is adaptive; recursively, because each pixel is repeatedly split and adaptive because the threshold values depend on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray has a ray per pixel. if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixel, then both pixels are calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth value of a set of 5 additional points, a grid value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r. 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each. when the difference between color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixels in 4 sub-pixel will be divided and the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you turn off Jittering, the rays change a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final adjustment for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detail stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail drawings for extended projections, all wireless camera views are used further, if the camera has an extended projection screen. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>

<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in section window orders will explain how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination array Standard window regulates: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window alignment when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list Add existing window orders displays all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window alignment is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views of the chosen window. new views can be created using the button Add and remove selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with a new column, create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with inlets you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card, the view is not installed in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have straight & Povray; and now, and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you can follow all steps in this tutorial, you should get the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a ball at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you complain that you as a result you can only use a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for the rendering can be applied as a result you receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add any light sources, your whole scene is dark and you'll only receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all installed correctly, see & kpovmodeler at the start of the first set of windows:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation that you can expect an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and icons often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry to delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you are in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view from the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the outcome of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the content of view object features, in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation of & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera, but note that the camera in view points has to change with which you can change the camera in view points. just click on the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button User or the button, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately depending on these settings. as a result, you can see the scene from the view of the camera here.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are lots of ways to create the ground for the scene. you might need to insert a quader (insertion Body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a logical method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers actually an easier way to use. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button User or button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-top view also displays the level, even though at the moment only as a limited level. if you render the scene, the plain extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you view the object tree precisely, you will find that you can flatten the entry for the ground. in this case you will see the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line only in order to get to know some of these parameters. select Displacement and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First, choose the floor to adjust its material characteristics. there are many different materials, but choose a bit aches in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box in which you can choose how to insert the object. please choose the name in the object tree. you can see the name in the object tree (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks like.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the Pigments only shows a matt black material, because you still need to check settings for the pigment. do you always remember to check the colors of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many options, but take advantage of the easiest option.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on Quader and Kugel in the preview, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you need to enter two new attributes. here you need to do two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can do this also more often, but the chess board list can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select each one and change the colors in the view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you just be able to accomplish this, as you should have understood the fundamental ways of work & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball. the ball is just as easy as the floor can be done:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object features you can immediately change the settings. put the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the button or the button), so the ball would float above the ground, as you have moved the soil around a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now gives a strange result: as before you see, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to you. as already in the ground, enter the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose the first subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on ball pigment, then select Incolor and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshot photos and click Apply or press the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully, you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you are looking for a scene raytraces, the Renate hypothetical Rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera to display the scenes) through any pixel by the objects and broken, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects act like fog. so, the scene pixel is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see it without a camera, the camera is your eye on which you can view the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simple black. obviously, every scene needs to be changed, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in default file dialog, you can select a file that you have before using & kpovmodeler; created</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to perform rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a Bump-Map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic body. these models are then processed further to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, by applying a image file as a color card.</seg>

<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable the output of external programs and commands. this way, dcop &gt; is usually called exec (). this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively simply. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are going to monitor their default scripts and react accordingly to events. of course, a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to view the setup dialog. to store and load the setup data each script must take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarok requires the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>

<seg id="1194">Customize Menuclicked: submenu bar, Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined item can be used. to remove the script called dcop Amarok script by dcop Amarok script. dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu bar).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok stops; or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do it for example, e.g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using a web server. we recommend a archive name as for example nzip2 (.bz2) which can optionally also be identified with bzip2 (.bz2), which can also be identified with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 you will only accept script packets with the extension of amaranscript. for this reason, you should name your script packets correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The key script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD requires that your window manager will function the relevant standards of freedesktop.org.

<seg id="1492">With this, it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b K3b Interface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolders / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder / foo dcop / or file.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioster; is an audio CD; Reader for & kde; with it you can easily read audio CD; it can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the Encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioster; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the release of & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and of many encoders, which are supported for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossy-free compression). more codiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) is compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudioster; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggprecbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed, so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself. but if for example FLAC does not use it, its installation will not be required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What codification / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kotherer gives a small introduction to Kodierer, Audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already mentioned, used & kaudiobl.cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection. if not the mechanism of copying it is possible. simply avoid the mechanism of coping protection. avoid the purchase of head-protected audio CD; S!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once has to be done (the setup dialog, however, is often called up to a suitable configuration), will follow the daily handling for reading a & CD; this leads (hopefully) for the slim approach of the user interface, which will often be proud of the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; information from the FreeDb comes out of the Internet or can work entirely without network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main window. on the page step for step example are more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB request of the CD data is set according to the device of inquiry in the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case it must first be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoder settings tab in the directive alogue - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of the available encoder, so that the option can be read from another encoder as the standard. it is to be observed that the encoder is configured in the tab settings dialog in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already released file will be selected instead of a full & CD; copies and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as protocols, piepsen) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminates).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudioster; with different card cards (such as Encoder, to set the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter contains sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder's choice.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'Monkey', which may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and no available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats, which lose information through data compress depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences will produce less important, as both Kothinner is very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be provided with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality when compared to deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing ogg-playing equipment is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">"--preset medium '= This setting yields good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">The --preset standard '= This setting is usually meant for most people and most of the pieces of music-acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires ever 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint Stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music by youngsters, portable devices and autographeoplants. but not good enough for hi-fi stereo equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which manually input or retrieved through the program automatically from the FreeDb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be delivered / used to create files and file names to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codierprograms there is often a combination of program settings for the codiers and these parameters. the manual or help to the Kodiers explain the switches on these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: tag), if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switches must be added to lame and the title parameter of & kaudiogies; the result looks like this: '... wtt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiogens; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDb is: a free database, in which people can download / enter the audio CDs instead of playing in the calculator. it is to be noted that here only by text can be downloaded here: & CD; titles, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (apart from the Ueberiser) I'm not an attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither can't be added to the artist or CD; more or less worthless, no other information can be received by a & CD; business, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioda; it is actively used to select a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used when calling the server (this can only know the programmers who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioke is set up; for use of FreeDb, the geographic is to be used on the closest mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; for information on reading a & CD; or alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which display program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that are using cdparanoia; if you want to know it more precisely, look at the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading Audio CD;. to note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed first if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the original WAV files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be selected. in the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the tab on this tab. other encoders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codile package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the codierer can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined Kotherer. more information on Kotherer are found in the chapter Welcher Kotherer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, more information about its switch can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console) 'lame' to be replaced by the name of the installed codierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many causes. please check the device of the device number of the CD; / DVD drive, the write and read real of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to specify both programs with a command line in a terminal. that might give us a note of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still insecure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, arrange everything and use our first & CD; we will lame '--preset extreme' to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be installed cdparanoia and lame on your machine. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not necessary to compile a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which of course you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to them (eg; by trying to copy something into account).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting of & kaudioda, something that is thought to be done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD;, which must be repeated for each tapered & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we are determining the used codiers for compression of music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to use the FreeDb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it when reading a & CD; change when the right settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device number is handed over to the reading program to read the & CD; - data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed, a look into the file / etc / fstick and a try with the existing entries for the CD-ROM, and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General Settings. here you will not have much to do. here, an additional transformation can be defined. in our example everything is left / typed as shown on screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, so you will be informed when data are missing from keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically download over the Internet from a FreeDb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading of the & CD; so that it can be connected to the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, a & CD; found immediately the release of the CD title and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, can be easily changed with the database name and the default directory names / filename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde;</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, you can continue to note: if you want to use everything manually, you can use the FreeDb locally in offline mode, if you want to use the database before. however, it is worth watching the two selection fields, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDb. these are settings for the data enquiry for calling the & CD; information from the FreeDb server on the Internet. how knows the system that data will get the CD? read the section on FreeDb. put everything as shown on screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the page freedb.org and look at a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way, the load is distributed between the computers. this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls are using the protocol 8880 standardly, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf on the web.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want & CD; data to the FreeDb server. the first check box should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply apply the settings of your screen photo. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously allowable pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? paralleles reading and coding? the author does not know it, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last part, please tick this on the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User definitive folder for temporary files: if you can specify this, then the path / folders are specified, in which the WAV files is stored. this can't be useful if only space is installed on a different drive. if you don't forget to do the files in a private folder, you don't forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All so as it is on the screen picture. the command is a little bit long, under circumstances must be blinded to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the record '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of creating tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in your screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: a single-core or multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic device of & kaudioster; terminated. this configuration is used as a standard for every release of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described as described as the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is described, as we are convenient and the & CD; data from the FreeDb will be set up. the process is described in this section, must be repeated for each taping & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not yet included in FreeDb, the screen photos will see a bit different from the freeware of FreeDb. therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually to pick it out of the Internet. comments will point out to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example can be found. it's a 'special' output of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, the & CD must now be inserted into the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as on the screen photo. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up successfully from the FreeDb, all tracks of the songs are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; specifies a window to your & CD; and you can select the database entry, which is best suited to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of FreeDb (on the page & CD; -Settings in the dialog for the Settings). if you do not have any local database, but need data from the Internet, you need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD editor - entering the CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the play in the first line of the 'Current title', the rest of the data in the 'Album' field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the 'Upeller title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidigerell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieve of the data from the FreeDb, the CD editor is not blank, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor (e. g. all words with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album, and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have to set up an unlimited field of field; at least, this option will be set up in the tab settings' tab settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the Koedian to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which is obviously not correct with the style of the trigger CD; in this example, this is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are available under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields have already been filled with the recorded data, which we have covered for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the song in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear when you have downloaded the data from the FreeDb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check-out before each line of one piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of each piece, or use the button all the pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at a time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process, so this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is running out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Rider's orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read out on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you're trying to work with a codialer, which you have not yet installed. pieces which have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error has occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. thus, output and coding are parallel. observe the status review in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. at powerful machines the machine used with a amd64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous expressing and coding (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded, and a third order is coded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiogies, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, how the program can be adapted to your needs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variants of settings. it is best to read the step by step example of the options and settings. it shows screen photos of the various flashcards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these will be played by the series. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. find this in the menu collection under the point organizer.... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection is included at the beginning of the same songs as original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the time in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to no other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application this collection is not saved. remember that if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song to add a song. in turn, you can select the file dialog, with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the option auto adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add-up to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emptied. then this collection will then be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click away.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played off. if you select the series from the submenu image sequence of the menus, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list on the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the Next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button in the previous piece, the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To clear a collection, open the collection manager, select the gathering collection here and click the button to delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">Temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter since it is stored on leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer which are not General MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create an MIDI-Map that converts all events of the Change patch Serum to Bright piano in events of the Change patch Serum to Trumpet and therefore always allow a trumpet to be heard if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards GM -compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file that stores all required changes to play a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as many times as desired. the prerequisite for this is, however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches from General MIDI to be depicted on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equator is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and do not leave the line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to lay all the sounds that use this instrument to sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do so, wear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If now an MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (rifice), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant, in which every sound represents another percentering instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;), and not the one in which the sound does the pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you just have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are primarily used to form tones on the percussions channel. take a look at the supplied keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to change the first and the second channel, make it easy for the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option for this channel, all events will need to be ignored in the file! if you try to change the ForcePatch option, all events will need to change the patch on this canal. in this case, patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio can be multiplied in which ratio pitch-bender events will be multiplied by the value n, this will be used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to do so in the map file (no decimal commas).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is preferable to play a pitch with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards do not need to play two tones up to a octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu, dot MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on this Klaviaturen you can see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to view the played tones. in the menu, select Settings under the Point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays speed to play with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. therefore, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to turn left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the scores, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can perform in two different devices with very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; because it happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder that you want to add into & Conqueror; select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; - Window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, you need to add automatic add to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow keys left from Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard speed, click the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop a & contentor; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play an MIDI file or I want to play a file, only in the & Conqueror; -Window, and drag the file into the window of & kmid).</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen quickly a file, without adding them to a collection, turn off the settings Automatic Add to Collection, and the new file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.C and C.mid. first, you just want to play the first file. so, put the settings Automatic Add to Collection and open Amid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this an MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play also B.MID and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animated me, continue to program & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I'm studying mathematics at the university of Maacute; but I try to take a bit time for my hobbies. as Hobbies, I have a bit of time for my hobbies. as hobbies, I have a bit of time to make MIDI files, making music and prove phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all of you will send me a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to receive a MIDI file, but if you want to contact me, I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; written completely in my spare time and made by no emanating money for it. I would like to emphasize that I only accept news, because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM radio or AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a soundcard, you have to compile & kmid; with parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it runs as if you could have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links using the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Naturally, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy of hierarchy. if you add an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the selected entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and continuous playlist can also be changed by direct Editing of XML configuration files. of course you can only do it by default, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category click on it from the menu View and next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected from the menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when processing mode or a different group is selected without the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at starting and running can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 observer option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation while starting does not need to be short, it will automatically terminate by opening a source. this would be disturbing in the end animation, however, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of an animation can be displaying a favorite photos: & lt; / lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; In the source package of & kmplayer; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; supported by & kmplayer; supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. here, the path from the player and the cache size of the data flow from the network and other things can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition device in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>

<seg id="1726">To keep a given backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this has been obtained), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon will be retrieved for all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play on TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before the TV channels can be configured, the scanner should be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port is to be found, one of which is selected to be selected. (for example, PAL for West Europe), the correct name has probably included a DVB input.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is also the only one that works). this is why the videoforlinux extension for the X server should also be working. for the XFree86 server, this must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings can be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is used by typing in document class. typically it will be used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the related commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps were completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document can be used to create your own template instead of defaults.</seg>

<seg id="1827">This command is to jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the current bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is to jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded tubular bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the thwarted clamps of a & tex; group # is located at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">During the input of many waved groups of clamps, the previous group can quickly be lost. this command touches the last party's structure, so that the failing structure of the & tex; groups will not be discontinued.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plugins, the & quantides; laim, have with & quantum. even if the plugin system does not have to do so much. you can't wait until someone does not need to do so. plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI. these plug-ins can be used in more detail below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we begin with the Edit plugins menu. thus, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all the plug-in plugins and add new ones. we describe every & GUI element:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a memory place is used & quantitative; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarchical relation. & quantum lus; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties -Dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the name of the user and serves as a unique identifier.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as team leader as well as Subproject leader.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select himself from the list of teammates who he is. this happens when he expresses the team member from the list and press the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identification) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and notes. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of your team, there is another advantage by the members of the team: it can be an event for information about the team leaders, if something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are carried out if something specific in the project happens. an example would be the recording of the opening and closure of the project, so that later you can see if a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">Events can be edited, edited and deleted by the event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee list selected address. the address can be a team or subproject leader. see in, wei are set up such ladder.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the document. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note: you can either select the note message from the editor-context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary area followed by note text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be a definable member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname of the first name of the team member, is a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities: team Manager Head of the area and subproject ladders should be given the corresponding range or subproject names, as in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantitative information; concerning tags including car completion can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / small chabortion of tags: large / small chabortion of automatically added tags. normal large / small chaggeration means that tags are added, as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / declining of attributes: large / small shrink of automatically added attributes. normal large / small chaggeration means, the attributes are added as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if attached, for tags, for which the closing day is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">No optional tags automatically include: as above for all other tags except for the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update and closing day automatically: if switched on, the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa.</seg>

<seg id="1956">MIME types: Mimetyps for detection of different types of files. using the Standard can restore the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created or used in other ways than with file open open files (where the encoding of the file can be addressed here), but this setting is downloaded from the same in the project characteristics, if a project is charged.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected, but this setting is downloaded from the same in project features, if a project is charged.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantitative Analytics; creates regular backup copies, so that the document can be restored from this backup during the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file. this is not the same as saving of the file. this is not a backup regular, according to the set time created.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or in an own view (or documentation in a cardboard box), which makes it possible to preview the documentation and source code simultaneously.</seg>

<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by accumulation of no longer enquiries.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change behavior of & VPL; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behaviour of the VPL- and source text view in split mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here, the parser and the structural tree, which represents the figure of the parser node in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structural tree, it is possible to change the action taken by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structural settings, the visibility of nodes can be automatically opened to the editing and how deep when changing the structural tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text, while empty groups such are found in which there is no item found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for determining abbreviations (one type of templates), which are unfolds during the editing at a larger text. this means it can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means it can be a valid group for PHP in which the ificabbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins can be managed by plugins. plugins are part applications of third page, which can be reused by any part-enabled application, the best known & conqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be stated:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Adress: the path to the plug-in if there is not at a standarable as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>

<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-Lese" mode: check if the plug-in is denied. only-Lese-KParts refuse to store this option if this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if it is activated, then check & quantide; if the plugin is correct, then the plugin in the moment is not available, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantum lus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely new developed. the support for the dbg debugger. instead, the support for the dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented, enabling various implementations over plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantitative; Included.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a matching debugger plug into the project settings. with the button options next to the debugger plug-in selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a project is enabled for a debugger, some additional elements appear in the & quantitative interface; -UI:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of the monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, in which all holding points are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that is shown in the output (as in HTML) of the debugger. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This promotion is used for debugger, if necessary, or it shares the plugin to listen to defile claims by default, if a project is opened by default, which does not normally have to be considered a debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger, or end the sound according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP request to the server to introduce a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request will be shown on debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates debuggers to start with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the current introduced line. if this happens, the execution is continued, before a debration requirement has begun, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates debuggers to start with the execution of the script without informing information and the current line number. if this happens when a script has been made, the execution begins as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will conduct the next statement in the script without going into the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger leads the next statement in the script, and if possible, in functions and includes faults.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points the debugger to go over and go to the next one as if there would be the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog box, in which a variable, or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the superior value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be input or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Documentation type Editing packets (DTEP; s) are used in & quantum. they enable & quantitative; abilities to perform markup and scripts. your simplicity and flexibility makes out of & quantitative; A fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic strip of image buttons (above the editing window), the text and instructions faster in a document as a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details of conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool bar. short, A & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property dialoges, the & quantitrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bar allow a quick paste of tags in a document without a risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Folders are nothing as a folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the recordable language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">Table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declare whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so many users can have better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes any element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is displayed in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but it contains nothing but an element type about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using it & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the tagtyp class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a methodology name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% day name, that means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag allows the elements of a list together. it can occur only once. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the attribute text of an tags found within a dialog. this tag can only occur once in a dialog only once (for example for each & lt; attack &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog box (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the defining tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>

<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but look for & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog box above is in the & quantum; -window to start and check TagXMLA. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not yet available. at present, checking only when charging the TagXML files in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -scheme. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a functional family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2026">A promotion can be set with Settings... Click on New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard assigned to this action. with clicking the User button, a key symbol can be assigned; with Kone, the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be input text in the detailed settings and insert this text in the document on the current cursor location. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which will change the document or as input (or parts of the document), even the Schnellstart-dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter should be specified. example: SH / home / mycscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Even though qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scripting variable in the command line, such as sh% script./ share / apps / qua / scripts in their path: $KDEHOME / share / apps / qua / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the current document in the case of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; only one instance is being replaced by the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & dosaplus; the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods mentioned above, a script input from & quantum. in the selection box can be specified, which is to be sent to the standard input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected field of document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal Edition, which is written on the standard output; error messages can be done using the text written to the default output by default, by default:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in this case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you will need to add actions and configure settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill all the necessary fields and add them to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes has and you plan to plan, check the dialog "tag when available, so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignati! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & kmenu;, graph Other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22 to change this, select editing size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol no longer helps you to memorize what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, is, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually referred to as a symbol), or should at least, a message to the user will be indicated that clicking this icon will add a & lt; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it still needs to be associated with the promotion. this is done on the menu with Settings... (in & quantum;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue it with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantide; -functions to toolbar, or it should set it to better overview by some separator in several groups. make sure the toolbar is selected for the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top right) for my toolbar. after the selection of the element to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the toolbar element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the konqueror preview. I will select it and add to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note that separator support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & Conqueror; - button on the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by testifying all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">If reeXML does not exist, it will be created imbal file, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder, so that its tool bar (s) should be loaded (s) when a file is opened from the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most mentioned enlargement of & quantum, for the normal user is the opportunity to like documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you may like. so this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, please check in & quantide; -Repository whether someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. then, we need to tell you the second part we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentations, e.g. php2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2.html day = tag2.html day 2 = tag2.html day = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example you see now in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2, PHP 4.2, = Table of Contents, # Getting Started = Introduction = Motion.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic synthes.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. it shows that it is about subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You can note that the contents page is referenced directly to a file (and then consequent at the upper end of the building supervision & mdash; folders is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but look for & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantum; Resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the area of the docrc file, which is to be displayed for designing the context-sensitive help. for example, if writing a & PHP; H for context help would display the documentation directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and file binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc and go to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / qua / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you read it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you're sure that these are good and worth it to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation is used to use by the & quantitative; -Community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative lus; are you not alone. it is possible to share the separating resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. in different places there will be send an e-mail menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all other & quantitative information can be downloaded, and only available when our team needs them as correct and usfull for publication, wherewith it an GPG / PGP key needs. thus, the source of resources will be ensured, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have several keys to enter a new resource (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), to upload toolbars, and files in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installation, examined & quantitative; the integrity of the resource is warmed and it may be canceled. please read the warning messages carefully and the resource is given correctly, a message appears with specifying the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not supported by & quantitative. however, the creation can be more time consuming because hundreds of tag files can be required in everyday XML format. there is the simpler Way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD store and convergence of DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target characters: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / qua / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that will appear in! doctype day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 /</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, provides & quantum, following the conversion and descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantum, there are some key concepts. to understand this and use full use of & quantide; this chapter will first try to bring these concepts, without their understanding & quantitative; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The workspace in three areas is divided into three areas: global, locally, and projects relating to this distinction, as a number of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantitative; use, available. by toolbars over actions, it is saved, in the common folder structure of & quantitative. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and samples in a global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of webdevelopers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user folder, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special promotions are set aside for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which provides common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantum lus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, tree views, flashes with information and tool bar. please beat in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the boxes with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching, reloading, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click on the editing pane highlighted in the editing area, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the file under the mouse cursor, or open the file when the string is described under the mouse cursor of a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window, the toolbar of the editor is the toolbar. currently, & quantitative; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown as a standard for which a set of toolbars are shown. in the course of further construction of & quantum, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really light. if they want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; then click the icon that represents the day. you may need to insert the data for this just inserted day. you should have a tag that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) enable to navigate in the information on & quantum; to navigate, to open and to roam. in the display with card holders stand for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation of building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool, which provides & quantitative information; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project via the right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading, or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantum lus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; there are all options open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be classified into three categories, depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects. more to templates is in place.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you find information on the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script. through the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send by email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed on the position of the Elementum. by right click an element opens a list of commands concerning navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree prospects. with it one can change some attributes and namespaces. the content-related application system allows changing all of the available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for Web-technology for your development. you can create documentation for & quantum; of the quantum, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantum lus; two cases at the bottom of the window that can be achieved using the useless information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information on any current script in quantity. such as the current DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantum, execute all error messages (such as it gives in this window).</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantum lus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command. the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define its own commands as symbols in & quantum.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantum lus; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email; and when they receive a toolbar in an email, they can be able to secure it into & quantide; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantum; -files on your system. for this, autoconf has made a number of options to get to the configure script. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not run here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting up & quantum, you should check whether your path contains the & kde; 3 I folders. you should also make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH before their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantum lus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantum lus was optimized for rapid Web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantum, started to deal with an obvious markup language editor? well, this would make it perfectly the most treasured web development tools for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; is limited, is & quantitative; now, already on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then, & quantum, then should be the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above-mentioned requirement has to be noted that & quantum; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community is based? thanks to & kde; - odours is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitative Analytics; allows to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can improve productivity almost every task. by the program Compremacy, it can be expanded, without any scripting language syntax. (more you can find them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More information in detail is with help: / quanta (either type this URL into & Conqueror; enter, or khelpcentre help: / quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& is currently developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequencer @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick-access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file, which is not found on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. should you try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project unit folder, only a bug is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when inserting from the clipboard there are special characters for & HTML; -spelling, so it does not display correctly and are not understood by browser as formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard to & URL, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; it is primarily used for inserting & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection or off. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or used with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the window window or not. this is the window, where you can see the viewing of scripting and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Trigger and Switching of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantitative; the main window. the problem reporter is activated, once you change to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column left from the main window. this column allows you to set the bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there is bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries predictable or next, depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">A existing project of the hard disk. & quantum, -projects are saved with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory after new files that could be there. this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folders or subfolder, and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Invites the files to your project high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and whether you have downloaded other input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantitative lus; the project manages. in Chapter & quantitative Analytics; - Projects explaining the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Downloads a project toolbar. these are stored in project Dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new tool bar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved by default actions. tool bar must be saved through toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the range of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you still haven't saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">In order to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantum, -Team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item will open a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server, where any other one can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you have made or anything else and convert to the & quantum of the & quantum.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / Relaxing of entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be changed without the whole & DTEP; if this is globally and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not available, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is available, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent entries of tags. currently, this does only work with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantum; the paste is denied by the tool bar if this day is contradicated to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins in the menu are listed below. click on it. click on an activated plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Choose the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available hazard schemata depends on derkates; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to the development. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD document; using the external application Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant change between the different types of user interface. through some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause time or unnice graphics. recommended is the card mode, which is also the default mode, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the presentation in & quantum, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open window. with selecting a single application the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Indicating the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantitative; main window to or out.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affects any application that use the KHTML-part, including the & Conqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the Editorwindow. in the documentation of & Kate, you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbar, or add or add sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mausoleum, but it is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative product; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with every open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quake; -Development in financial form, please find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the best of the project named after completing the project called the entire directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift; F7 Project Properties Tab.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantum lus project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (eg foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, one, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Once you use this field, the default log settings will be used. depending on the remote computer setting, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files for different projects is used, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows files to include files from the local file system to the project. several files or folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and modify the static web content you want to download and change. in case-sided scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Note, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included. if a project is started anew, not anhaze.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection for good thinner.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by anhaken or, by removing the checkbox, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu area or with the key symbol shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some of the settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible), which are rewritten in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">In supplementary option to the above, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded when opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed is being used. the debugger plugin can be selected using the Options tab. in this, the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, high load profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a server view for each profile, representing an own custom view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window managers, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration you can turn event actions and add these actions, change or delete any actions. event actions will be executed if a previously defined event occurs, as the fender of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default & quantum lus, the last project that was opened. this behavior can not be influenced at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the menu project or the symbol Open from the tool bar. the Open Project will be shown and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantum, it will be saved, the project file will be saved automatically if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantum; changed files. the same happens when you invite a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager provides free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders also behave, however, the entries opening and opening... in the context of the right mouse pop-up menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Various profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information on the site of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is only more a profile, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forget on programing. this possibility is useful if common uploading files is needed and the rather insecure password on the plate does not come in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantum, many high load profiles and so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them after your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can't be easily read, but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and tool bar. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple dipping of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened or deleted by toolbar within the menu or project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantum, with which one has to do most. this does not only improve productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative; to its own workings.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bar in & quantum lus; best accessible via the menu bar. use and adding them. adding tool bar is treated below in the added toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either by the context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which you can set different actions such as tool bar, which can be specified in the dialog, which can be specified in the dialog, where actions will be shown on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries action will be removed and the action are displayed, which are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions on them can set up settings in the menu with settings toolbars... and set settings to set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in key documentation, code carvings and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates to link existing files with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or use each at the system existing in the storage room. templates have in & quantiaplus in about the limitations, which one imagines to the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative reports; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binaries are normally inserted into documents using links (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates. more information about templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple framework for the purpose and organizes work in an appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found under global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment to a complete menu system on Javascript and perl basis. some examples are listed under global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for whole web sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to your will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File When presentation Save As Local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it is saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the repository. watch under the repository.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template to save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and laying on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Binary templates is simple: the file is only used in a template folder. it can be used to execute all the file management functions, such as pulling and insertion or insert on the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files to select a folder, select a name for the template and secure it. by default, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very purposeful procedure. you can create headlines and footer, or dynamic with & PHP; in addition you can add some things to using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the lower window template is based on the files specified in $KDEDIR / share / apps / qua / Templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / qua / Templates / share templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder is in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder, and select the context menu features. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this option is low as soon as terrestrial attributes can be scanned.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except for the main folders in the system table. if a master folder would be set off, it would explicitly appear in this path. if nothing appears, the Blah would appear with something like text construction. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows forward or presented text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footer for all templates for a specific project and enables copying of contents in a folder with special header lines / footer a whole presentation already fitted with the matching headlines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show that right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from a place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantum, offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source code editor, which are accessible via the menu View. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second split the editor window in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or a cursor. then you can edit and edit your code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document containing & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the Vohandler of & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor is still necessary to change this behavior. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except that the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor is visible and the cursor is activated in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor is already active, if the keyboard is shifted from a window to another, whereby the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via settings Quanta.... In case you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatic. in principle, the recommendation can be set automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted for fast calculator and a large span for slow PCs.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so tool documentation is possible. therefore, the editing of invisible tags is also possible, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; the editor is created. this can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added by pushing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list allows changing the contents, e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key word2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to create pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as with the Meta-Elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by pressing the file open button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is as usual in a text process, by moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves like usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by RÜCKTASTE or removed.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Adding tags is made in the same way via the toolbars as in the source code editor. it is to be aware that the insertion of tags is already existing already existing identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables wizard or the lists-assistant are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for testing stylisteners. in contrast to other programs for breastfeeding, the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the breastplate can be prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To be able to compile & xsldbg; you need libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already available for a typical installation of & kde; they are already available.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated, because one of the contributing had changed many changes and at the same time had changed a lot of changes at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of changes in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me was only showing me the modified lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the reverse was changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent the differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, lots of further useful functions have been added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you would like to compare text, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it to one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function made a lot of work was the comparative and merging of folders. this function turned into mutated & kdiff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge operation is also fully supported. this is useful if two people are able to work independently of one piece of coils and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to solve the result. in this editor you can even process the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screen photo shows three source files at the merge command:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also like the same and merge complete file. this screen saver features & kdiff3; in folders:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and look similar to the possibilities of today color monitors. if you often need to check Koen, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no worry if no one changes the shift.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color indicates that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can ease your tippwork by typing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffuse folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual typing of filenames, the selection of the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will be displayed again. if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder, if you select a folder, if you select a folder, for B and C, a folder will be used for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merges are crossed, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file, even later in store.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup process opens up a dialog with settings. here you can set options before using the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard. in opening dialog, you don't have to select any files, you can easily connect the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and dismantling: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes contains a file for example several similar functions. if you want to figure out how much the functions are, they would have to compare two appropriate files, to copy them into & kdiff3; now you can easily copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only to remove text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insertion of text into another program as cutters and insertions (instead of copying and paste). in such cases, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line of the source window is the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional, then leave the mouse a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are associated with letters A, B and C. a color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences may be changed over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one sees in the color, which is different. if both files differ is the default color for it is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. with some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, relevant to the preprocessor and in a few, rare instances.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column of the text, is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison chart) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [Gewands] if you already have the outcome. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, saving is disabled!!! (use buttons to find next dissolved / unsolved conflict in order to find remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons can be used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this will also be the first line in the windows.) this group will be highlighted in the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes it is left through automatic merge or manual editing no more line longer in the group; then this is only a wildcard for the case that you may change your mind, and perhaps a different source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; Mergeinfo conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy this text from the result window. carefully go to this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources select numbers, ignore or ignore options C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the image and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the windows, you can also use the arrow keys left, right, end, Strg-Beginning and Ctrl end, siw how you can also use it from other programs. the safest column next to the vertical panel bar can also be used by entering the navigation bar.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the window window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the insertion button, you can switch between insertion and writable mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the collision columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the section and explained the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar includes seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Picture Down) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Picture Down) or for the next / previous conflict. therefore, between solved and unsolved conflicts can be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you will need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insertion). if this is enabled, you will also automatically copy the clipboard. be careful with this option but be careful because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeiling are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-in-line\, and Win32-based systems use car reversal + Zeilenforge\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the lashing of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start. (menu Instellungen- &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a typeface with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog is used with variable widths to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italics are displayed in italics. if the chosen font is not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be shown. on these systems, the button will automatically create an unlocked color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the tabulator button will insert the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator-sign will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press entering or return, the recovery of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. manually copy the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-up type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used option on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files are tried & diffuse; first, all identical lines can be ignored in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step is not ignored every line. in this step, white characters will not be ignored. white characters won't be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car back sign '\'. usually ignored & cdiff3; however, if this option is enabled, the wagon covers are visible, but if this option is activated, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">The default value is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">Default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The auto-skip mode determines this setting, as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is going to continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you are able to ignore all the functions in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in chapter to scan folders and flow of interaction. check for details under documentation of the folder comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .original file. if already there is such a backup file with the suffix .original file, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Does not fit the interface language. changing this option does not concern the current running program. you need to quit and re-launch it. (this option is active in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is currently used globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activated this option, the upper settings will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the drop-fields for encoding appears a brief reference, which is the local codification. (this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file code for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which codification should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you may not need to work with your codec. (e.g., your files might be 16-bit Unicode.) With this option, you can define the coding of the output command commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this down to suppress any changes in white characters in the text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may see only the differences between two of three files. but sometimes you want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is still a second, safest column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">If the comparison window is adjacent to each other, it can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge command and uses the file name of the last source file as default for the output file. (if this function is used to reboot the merge, then the name of the last used file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be given first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which equates to your own requirements. you can use this function, for example, to remove bother parts or to correct the retention.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command, then the output of the command is used only when using this command processor. the output of the command is used only when it matches your own requirements. each input line must have an associated entry line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it. however, good news is, however, that in most cases it will suffice or perl perfectly sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Please use this pre-processing command for line parts to change the input in uppercase: Sed's /\\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\' in one line. the\\ U lists the found text in the first plain text. the\\ U converts the found text in capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). all follow the same pattern $Keyword product\ 's /\'\ '\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\\ _ BAR _ Date\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with Sed, you might start to understand it and maybe like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignorance of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it's good as an example for another prefabrication command for Zeilenabsent. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Each character between '[' and ']' is a hits, and every match is replaced by nothing, so virtually erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple translations at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the needs of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used, you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'However, perl some details differently. where used\\ (and\\) needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">Data after the normal preprocessor are retained for viewing and to merge. further operations just change the data that the Zeille-Algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the cell-off preprocessor looks the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the lyrics changes or differences, you accidentally don't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal from the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes, without having to perform it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... guides selected actions either with all (F7 key), or with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the default and merging of single files. you just have to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder was specified, used & cdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not the merge. to start the merge button, select the respective menu entry or press the F7 button. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder, you will find a small news window over current progress. if you suspend the folder, only the files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is complete, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together, by clicking on the + / - click on the line or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation can not be selected automatically. if merging is started, you will be informed by problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in columns A / B / C are used in red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Stewards are considered to be identical if you are all identical content. then, folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again, which is only green then yellow and later when it is old, red will be red.</seg>

<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New files are activated, then examines & cdiff3; the date of files and suggests the same date. if the files are different, but the date is identical, but the date is identical. if such errors are not removed, the merge can't be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file after the other operates. it status column indicates that when the merging was successful, and correspondingly other messages, if something unexpected is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When the setup dialog has chosen fully-constant analysis, Kdiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts will only appear if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge either the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (even in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified the target folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode C, the two-folder merge will be used as target and for synchronizing is A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries are to be displayed in the target folder, even in the folder structure, there are some options to be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring together all entries: select directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keynote sign). to run only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options running, stimulate and breaking.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate when you only want to see what would happen without the really changes done. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual operation is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (see the screenshot one).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are ready with a file, select again directory together / continue or press F7. if you still haven't saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error, you will see a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that you should try to skip the cause of the problem or to resolve the problem of the problem or to solve the problem in any way before you continue with the result.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were compiled individually, these entries are noted (in the current session) and results in later stages of all entries. even if the merge changes have been taken up or not saved, these entries will change as performed. only if you change the merge action, these entries are collected again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called Directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern, are displayed in the element tree. separate wildcard with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than one pattern, use the Semikolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than one pattern, use the Semikolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many authors generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be folder specifically with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a default attribute. this option allows you to decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links will show. this is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared to. if the option is switched on, the links are treated like normal folders and recursively searches. (note that the link does not include a link to itself.) This option is shut down in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Results in full analysis of any file by and displays statistics columns. (the number of soldered, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when used to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding Anti-Pattern)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the date of change and the file size. however, this option is limited to caution. please use caution when default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to, e.g. when copying the changesdate. please use caution when copying the changesdate. this option is defaults to default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was selected. in this mode, the suggestions for merging files are selected. also, the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is shut off in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences will be suggested instead of merging the newer file as action. (this will be considered insecure, because the other file is not altered as well. you should check this in any case.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted, the original version will be renamed and the extension .original If an old backup file is already existing, this will also affect the normal interaction of individual files, not only the merge to all folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge operation always remains visible to the merge single files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch the window lists in the window menu and switch between the two opinions between the two opinions.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-click. however, in the directory menu, you can also use a single file directly, so you can use the current file to run it, and the file will not run once again, and the file will not run again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is, however, lost when you read the directory: read here: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively tund. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space mark &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link is displayed on a file or a folder. then there will always be a file as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process authorizations or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date are removed from the original. (note this option only if possible.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main objective is currently available as the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop always starts the built-in differences in KDevelop. to start with KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then choose In KDiff3part view from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - Kreducing 3Part. please note that it doesn't work if there is none of the original files. besides, it is unreliable when the original files have changed since generating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it supports only the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the same of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now heist combs) are already available. moreover, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>

<seg id="2433">The editor appears for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to create a conflict easily by clicking in the source code and selecting the button if the result is simple as a text file, and it is too much effort to design extra a private file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too large. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit large amounts of text should be used another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src lints; no src left; and the text cannot be removed. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>

<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. but use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you are looking for a neutral mouse click. safe zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey surfaces around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shift, but I don't make it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent dumping is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time to copy it, to copy it to the clipboard or move it again. but it will probably only prepare problems with you. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use smart shifts if you just start working & kmousetool; to use. select text instead as follows: execute the Shift key instead, while you move the mouse cursor over the other end of the text, and once again enter the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">So use the audible mouse click. this way, when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the smart shift begins. later, you can use smart shifts without the audible mouse click. but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the Xtest extension for & X window; it should be the case on most systems already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are properly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activated the mouse button once the mouse cursor is short. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and to which the actuating of the crest pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to configure a certain period of time, that a pulling process begins to release before the mouse button will release. in this way, pulling and playback can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & kton; for normal work with & ktops; filters do not require filters.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, a matching language and voice to handle certain defects of language synthesizer and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program works "speech-dispatcher" with a text. & kton; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Saver has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these assignments. if the output of the screen reader is read, the received orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved for hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and regular text. these orders will continue after the warning of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next amount of messages. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the messages. while you are looking for a long text on a web page, you can also enter the room. & kmouth; alerts are also messages. read it too.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text jobs. each order that you use by the card card is a text job. KSayit is an example of applications that have text jobs. text jobs are intended for the edition longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues, except the output of screen Readers. if any application sends the output of a screen-reader, while & ktops; just one such message is reading, this issue will be stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters can never be applied to the output of Screen Saver. they are used for normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter process the text and give it to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the replacement parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktats; used by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & Kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; transforms use a XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) to convert from a format to another format. in scope of delivery of & ktats; some XSLT files are included for the translation of & XHTML; in SSML format.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaking selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of text or depending on the program, which has sent the text to & kton; if you have submitted a female voice for example, you can read text from KDE messages about it. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters is adjustable, after which it is applied for a voice output. if the filter indicates that its rules does not apply, he gives the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text job, a message, warning or a & kde; -Notification of & ktats; sent to them by all activated filters, which were set up on the page below. editing through the filter occurs in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This displays the list of the furnished normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not checked and is not used. filter will follow the range upward downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will be displayed on the following setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Please enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. these patterns are found in the text, then the text will be replaced with the appropriate replacement. large and small narrative is not considered by comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Type a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you want. it just needs to differ from names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column and replace it in accordance with the string from the column Replace by. the list is handled in the order shown above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to shift the marked word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load or delete a list of words or regular expressions of a file, save the current list or delete a list from a file, entries from the file will be attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is registered here, the filter will only be used if the speaker for the text job is one of the languages registered here. you can also select multiple languages if you click the & Ctrl key at the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be used when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separately by commas. example: conversation, Kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You can get the application ID running programs with the program qdbus; the & DBus; numbers have to be omitted for example. if for example & qdbus; the user ID head-3432 can only be set.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string hook script will only apply to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box diesen filter. if all input fields are blank, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the batch replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s word. so words must be limited by separator (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this guide you can find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have the & kde; -Editor & # 160; Expressions installed, you can find it in dialogs Add or edit as help to merge these expressions. the & kde; -Editor & # 160; Expressions & # 160; Expressions can be found in the ambigtils package.</seg>

<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from the source code for kaccaccessibility or download all night-created tarball, translate and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you can use & ktops; check first if speech-dispatcher works properly with your language controls. to do so, you can use the Shellscript spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktats; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktats; the program kttmsgr is to be developed so that the device of speech-dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text will be decomposed into single sentences. the user can revoke satz- or december, repeat, stop or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If any application text can be submitted to & kton; for example, you can request the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have a speaker, whose language is English and whose gender is female, it will be automatically elected the best matching speaker. if you want to learn more about how & kton; a speaker will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2685">For example, if you click on the map speaker on Add, and to edit a speaker on the list or click Edit button, the card box is shown in the following. as an example, the module setup will be shown in the module for details of the modules.</seg>

<seg id="2705">Warnings is a priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning will keep the output of news and regular text. these orders will continue after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you are & eg; just to welcome a long text on a web page, you can still get someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text job is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen-reader, add & kton; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">The audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted. if both introductory sounds are active as well as introductory message, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a voice output, the speech speed, volume of speech and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktats; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You have to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the standard voice, which is used in the SSML edition.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or sound conditions at the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp;% is adjusted, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDB filter). this can also start reading or cancel the entire text contract, as only the first sentence has to be synthesized, not the whole text contract. thus, you can also stop or stop or stop, even if the synthesizers do not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the Satzest recognisable filter. when the first start of & kton it is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add another satzest-recognition filter, but beginner is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the installation of the speaking selection by trying. turn the microphone selection again and specify some features and check out how the speaker's selection has changed. of course you have to have set up more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& kton; then, faster with the pre-reading can begin, as only the first set must be processed and not all text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">They can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizers do not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-limit filter will be set automatically when you start typing smgr for the first time. it cannot be removed, just change anything about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Typing filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tabular (decimal code 8) to the typist limits (decimal code 8) to the typist (automatically removed from the text). note that the standard proposition filter provides the string.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied to & kde; -News (kman), warnings, news or the output of Screen-Readern.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have a look from the normal set-limit filter, you can re-paste it by using the default _ sbdrc standard.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map selection menu you can write the microphone settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>

<seg id="2740">Choose the properties of the requested speaker. if this property doesn't play any role, don't give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this checkbox if the property should have priority over other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue is, it is always used as a prime property. you might want to use this property if you possibly know that a specific application is provided in another language as in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all properties in the field of speakers, which is closest to the following, click on the select button standard speakers and then apply to speakers who are closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last text job in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (no order number is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and & ktops; probably you must register GStreamer 0.8.x. if the problem is not resolved it is possibly a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall a GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output of ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application music. if I start a text job, freezes & ktops; a message on the & console; appears: the open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem that conflicts at ALSA will occur, which will prevent the same time opening of several PCM devices. references for possible solutions will be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-Mast.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded another Voice for Festival from the Internet. I installed it and can not use them at festivals, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the card card audio there is a setting speed. so this works, the program must be installed instant and over the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive can also offer a setting for speed. depending on the selected voice, this function is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the microphone speed are ignored when & ktops; & HTML; pre-reading. (this is your own tag, which is controlled by the speed.) Deactivate the .xsl file of the & HTML; (see) or if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML reshaping filter, and set up the microphone speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make that web pages have been read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesman, but & kton; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The homepage from & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distribution (usually rpm packages) is enough, if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it's simply the rpm package to download and in a & console; using rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with a graphic interface, such as kpackage or install tool can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; but additionally, the development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should accomplish this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given in the second, all by & knetworkconf; changing configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot substitute any further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC are mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 never has big spread. from IPv6 it is expected that it is now concentrated in the near future. this description is based on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledgeable IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, am & eg; workplace is the network administrator address the contact address, which can be used as DHCP. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When placing an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially designed area to avoid IP address conflicts using the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are mostly used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the power mask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, there are the configuration files affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified in DSL connections, so it is not surprising if in the case of active DSL connections another content is specified there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the opportunity to create several archives on a tape. the first goal was the responding to a question for quick, selective unpacking. the second goal was the responding to a question that my wife ordered: how much longer does it take if you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it has to be integrated by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trains the band back and reads the pretension information of the band. recognize & kdat; the tape on the tape will not be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the spell check it searches for the right index on your record. cannot be found if the band index is to be created new.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, changes the symbol for the tape drive, in order to indicate that the band has been integrated. in the statusbar there will be a corresponding message. the contents of the tape can now be searched by issuing the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the band, first must be solved at first. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be recognized by a change of symbol for the band, that the binding for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the band can now be kicked out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band cards must be formatted before you have to be formatted to store data. this process does not necessarily have to formatting a band before using. floppy disk drives usually do form a formatting of the tape ahead, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape are lost. after completing the formatting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you push the backup process, you must select the secured files, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a profile profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in a local file tree with a tick. only the marked files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button, click on the local file tree and select back in the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog for backup is opened. in this dialog, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive. it will only be checked for selected file or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are tested.</seg>
<seg id="2912">With the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test is started, the dialog settings dialog appears. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for checking, the dialog appears to check this dialog. this dialog indicates the progress of the test process as well as data throughput and time periods.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before releasing the restore, the files must be restored, which will be restored. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to the entry for the tape drive. it is only restored the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the so-selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button, click a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recreation process was launched, the dialog for Restoring. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog appears to restore. this dialog indicates the progress of recovery, as well as data throughput and time periods.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexed file based on the band's content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should be done. the list of safest files will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, that only those files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folder that can be found on other file systems, you can apply separately using backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incircle backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine changes since the last incircle backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; gt; lt; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of preparation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set you up through the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path bends to the non-rev variant of the band device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is unloading, it is necessary to load the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & put the dat; this setting doesn't work on all drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the soldering of the integration of & kdat; automatically discard the tape. use this option not with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, & kdat; the hardwaresfull block size for tape drives. not all drives support variable blockformats. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must inform & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only take a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are compiled as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The Band ID. the format of this string is the machine name: seconds, where computer name is the complete name of the system, on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time has been formatted in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The Band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archive, which can manage directly with & GNU, tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not concerned about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup material. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer right for system logs. the program is intended for unexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows for the various protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems focusing on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your machine makes in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified ID of the protocol-files of your own system. the program is intended for unexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system lays down the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quick access to information on the problems encountering on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, some advanced functions are trying to work and analysed the protocol-files certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog has a number of useful functions. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot one see & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the various protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol will open, and it will not be displayed with system-swalterright. the protocol files are usually not included in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually does not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out the filter bar, so that only log messages can be displayed in the filter bar, so that only log messages can be displayed in the filter bar, so that only log messages can be displayed on the filter. then a protocol line is displayed only when in one of the columns contain the string of the Filter search engine.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry on this site. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and enter it in the filter bar the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting, and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of level errors are displayed with a striking colour as protocol-lines of the level. the colour display of protocol lines can be shut down dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example, in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example, if you want to investigate the output of a particular command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case you will use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump to the new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all new lines of the coming Protocol.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage an additional window, select a log message in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a dedicated website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.or.Dort you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system quickly develops into the standard for controlling the system start-up system in the & Linux; hence, because it's easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go to historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V Init, without any reinstallation and re-format. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service that you want to start at the system or when switching to another round level. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it actually doesn't have much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something that has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches at different places according to the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have a bit confused, then you will repair it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that no right files are in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Just like starts and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written that it is a argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will be called stop stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple kind of machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level, that only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; can also be run; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six rounds to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can shift scripts between Runleveling or change the position within one level by removing it elsewhere. this will only be done if it does not occur if you want to extract an entry from the field of disposition.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you move them into a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and even then, if the same entry has previously been in the target range of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the bounding entries, before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator key to activate the different working ranges (Available system services, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection top or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change sorting number or the name of a single entry manually, press the button key to open the Properties button in order to accept the Properties button in order to accept the changes, or push Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of the data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. settings will be saved in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; otherwise, changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard laptops, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have made some system services with & ksysv; for executing the runlevel X, but they will not be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services are started in these distributions, but does not simplify the configuration for the proprietary integration programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately not a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are needed (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply without a message, if their configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
